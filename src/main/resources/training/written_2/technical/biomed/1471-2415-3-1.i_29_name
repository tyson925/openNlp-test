        The normal human ocular lens exhibits a steady increase
        in size due to growth throughout life, harboring some the
        oldest cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Overall, from birth to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years of age</TIMEX>, the human lens will increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> in
        equatorial diameter, while increasing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 22%</NUMEX> in A-P axial
        thickness [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Cell growth dramatically influences the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contours of the anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior lens surfaces, but
        is not the sole factor affecting lens form.
        Previous studies investigating the hydration of
        transparent human lenses revealed an age-related dependence
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content and lens <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . With
        advancing age, the human lens cortex shows a slight
        increase in water composition (+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0087%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/year</TIMEX>), whereas the
        nucleus decreases its total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content (-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.077%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/year</TIMEX>),
        setting up a gradient of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydration</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Studies of human
        diabetic lenses have revealed greater total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content
        in comparison to transparent, non-diabetic lenses, with
        swelling reported to extend into the adult and perhaps the
        fetal nuclei [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . The result is a characteristically
        larger lens in comparison to transparent, age-matched,
        non-diabetic lenses. Previous documentation by Scheimpflug
        analysis demonstrated that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> expansion rate of the
        lenticular A-P length is accelerated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> in early-onset
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Steepening of the anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curvatures</ENAMEX> was detected but little difference in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> nuclear size was found. The osmotic imbalance observed
        in the diabetic lens may be responsible for the pronounced
        influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into the epithelial and cortical areas,
        swelling and damaging the cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        In our previous morphological study of non-diabetic
        aging human lenses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> it was concluded that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">innermost</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> of the human lens significantly
        decrease in size and change shape with age and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cataractogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , a process termed compaction. In
        concordance with previous investigations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , it was
        found that the rate of lens compaction was not constant
        over time, and that the majority of compaction was observed
        before middle age. Changes in the A-P length of the
        embryonic nucleus impact the curvature angles of the inner
        fetal nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> at the equator, possibly affecting the
        overall lenticular form. Employing transmission electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (TEM) in an additional study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , extensive
        fiber cell damage was noted in the outer adult nucleus of
        late-onset diabetic cataractous lenses, with minimal
        morphological disturbances in the inner nuclei.
        In this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> was used to search for evidence of
        osmotic swelling and/or fiber cell compaction in the
        nucleus of non-cataractous and clinically diagnosed nuclear
        cataractous human lenses from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Due to
        the manner in which we receive our specimens, the nature
        and medical history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> are unknown.
        This study aims to compare the transparent lenses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to those of with nuclear cataract,
        without conclusions based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease type</ENAMEX> or treatment. For
        further comparisons, previously documented non-diabetic
        compaction data was utilized [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Specimens
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> diabetic human lenses, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69 to 73 years of age</TIMEX>, were
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Disease and Research</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interchange</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). Lenses were enucleated
          and placed in primary fixative (detailed below) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 4</NUMEX>
          to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> post mortem. Specimens were shipped by
          overnight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> at room temperature to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
          for further processing. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRB</ENAMEX> requirements do not allow the
          distribution of detailed patient information; age,
          gender, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">diabetic state</ENAMEX> of the tissue are known,
          but the type and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> remains unknown.
          Lenses with obvious nuclear scattering, history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cataract</ENAMEX>, or cortical or posterior subcapsular scattering
          were excluded from the study. The transparency of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lens</ENAMEX> was evaluated on a backlit calibrated reticle.
          Transparent lenses caused little distortion of the
          underlying grid.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> human nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cataractous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> nuclei from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, ranging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 to 61</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, were obtained following <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">extracapsular</ENAMEX> extraction
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Eye Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). These lenses exhibited
          significant nuclear light scattering diagnosed as
          cataract by slit lamp, and warranted removal by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ophthalmologist</ENAMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4</ENAMEX> scale [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ). The
          extractions were performed by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> using
          consistent techniques. Nuclei were transported to our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> in vials with gauze moistened with balanced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> solution at room temperature and were placed in
          primary fixative within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> of extraction. As in the
          case of the non-cataractous diabetic lenses, detailed
          information concerning the diabetic type, disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, and treatment was not distributed. Potential
          variations in morphology between post mortem and
          surgically extracted lenses were minimized by using
          identical preparation techniques. All donated lenses had
          no history of laser or intraocular surgery, and were
          obtained according to the tenets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helsinki</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Sample preparation
          Lenses were preserved in a primary fixative of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          buffered formalin (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX>) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> at room temperature with slight agitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
          . This was followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> of fixation in an
          osmotically balanced solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> gluteraldehyde in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.12 M</ENAMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cacodylate</ENAMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX>) at room
          temperature with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> fix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>. Each lens was
          washed overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cacodylate</ENAMEX> and the
          nuclei dissected as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In
          brief, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mm trephine was used to extract the core of
          the lens around the optic axis. The anterior and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> disks of tissue overlying the inner nuclei were
          removed with forceps, and the process repeated until the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct Y</ENAMEX>-suture pattern could be resolved on the lens
          surface (indicative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX>). Each lens core was split
          along the optic axis with forceps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and post-fixed
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> aqueous osmium tetroxide for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Following several washes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium cacodylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX>, the lens portions were dehydrated in a graded
          ethanol series. Samples were critical point dried in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liquid CO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Balzers CPD 010</ENAMEX> (Balzers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liechtenstein</ENAMEX>), mounted on aluminum stubs,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). Specimens were examined on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">JEOL 820</ENAMEX> scanning
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEOL USA, Peabody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magnifications</ENAMEX> ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-2500</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. Stereo</ENAMEX> images were
          taken with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12Â°</NUMEX> of tilt.
        
        
          Morphometry
          To detect differences in the extent of compaction
          between transparent and cataractous diabetic lenses, some
          of the same analysis procedures outlined in our previous
          SEM compaction study were used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In brief, each
          sample was oriented with the features of interest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perpendicular</ENAMEX> to the viewing angle (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0Â°</NUMEX> tilt). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> is very important due to aberrant
          measurements that can occur when the tissue is viewed at
          an angle. To confirm the proper viewing angle, tilt
          series and stereo imaging were utilized. Representative
          micrographs were carefully chosen for the measurement
          process. Computer-assisted measurements (using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>
          Photoshop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, CA; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned SEM</ENAMEX> micrograph negatives investigating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (magnifications are in parentheses): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.

          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-60 X</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. embryonic nuclear polar axis length
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">200-400 X</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. average number of embryonic nuclear
          fiber compaction folds over a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼m</NUMEX> distance (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
          X).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior ellipsoid angles were measured
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm from the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">EN</ENAMEX> along the equatorial axis.
          Computer generated ellipses were mapped to the FN fiber
          cell(s) at this distance in both directions. A table of
          ellipsoid axis ratios generated from the measurements of
          ellipse templates of varying degrees and axial lengths
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alvin & Company Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>) was used to
          determine the anterior and posterior angles for each
          sample. The axial length measurements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EN</ENAMEX> were made
          along the optical axis from the initiation of the fetal
          suture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> at the anterior and posterior poles. To
          determine the mean number of membrane compaction folds on
          the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EN fiber cells</ENAMEX> over a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼m</NUMEX> distance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> measurements per sample were compiled and
          averaged. Due to the variation in separation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> from
          sample to sample, it was not always possible to measure
          every parameter in each lens.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Lenses were compiled into transparent diabetic or
          nuclear cataractous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diabetic groups</ENAMEX> for statistical
          analysis. Limited knowledge of the multiple population
          distributions comprising each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the relatively
          small sample sizes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , could undermine the power of
          most standard parametric statistical tests. For these
          reasons, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided non-parametric <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> -test was chosen for the
          comparisons. Any significant results of these tests were
          interpreted as trends between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Descriptive
          statistics were calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StatView</ENAMEX> (v. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0.1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were
          considered significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Non-diabetic lens</ENAMEX> measurements
          from our previous study were included for additional
          comparisons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morphological</ENAMEX> changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> with
          cataracts
          Examination of the peeled and split lens nuclei by SEM
          revealed an ideal and reproducible dissection procedure
          for the exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EN fibers</ENAMEX> along their length
          near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-sagittal</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. Unlike the cells of the
          outer nuclei and cortex, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , no
          noticeable cell damage could be detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> at low
          magnification in the diabetic fetal and embryonic nuclei.
          As in non-diabetic tissues, little morphological
          difference could be resolved by superficial observation
          between transparent and cataractous diabetic lenses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Detailed analysis at higher magnifications,
          however, demonstrated the differences between specimens.
          A summary of the morphometric data is given in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          Low magnification micrographs facilitated measurement
          of the FN elliptical angles in the transparent diabetic
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cataractous diabetic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B) lenses. Due
          to the differences in anterior and posterior curvatures
          in the human lens, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ellipses of different sizes are
          mapped to each. Transparent lenses displayed an average
          anterior fetal elliptical angle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26Â°</NUMEX> while the
          cataracts averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23Â°</NUMEX>, a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>. Similarly, the
          average posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX> angle was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11% smaller</NUMEX> in diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> compared to transparent tissue (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28Â° to 25Â°</TIMEX>,
          respectively). Medium magnification analysis allowed the
          entire EN to be viewed, with its centrally located fibers
          and lack of suture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. On the average, the
          transparent diabetic lenses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) exhibited an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">EN A</ENAMEX>-P
          axis length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">138 Î</NUMEX>¼m while the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cataracts</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼m</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> decrease (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). At high magnification, the
          surface topography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EN fibers</ENAMEX> is easily visualized,
          facilitating quantification of the membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> folds
          of the cell surfaces (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, arrows). Transparent
          diabetic lenses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber folds</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          Î¼m than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> with nuclear cataract (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.53</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.95</NUMEX>, respectively).
          To better appreciate the three-dimensional nature of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> of the inner lens nuclei and their
          surface characteristics, stereo images have been included
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          
            Comparisons between transparent and nuclear
            cataractous diabetic lenses
            Statistical analysis indicated significant
            differences in the measurements between transparent and
            nuclear cataractous diabetic lenses in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> of the
            examined parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Comparisons between diabetic and non-diabetic
            lenses
            To detect any changes in compaction due to diabetes

        Discussion
        Comparisons of transparent diabetic and diabetic lenses
        with nuclear cataract yielded statistically significant
        differences in each measured parameter, indicating a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detectable</ENAMEX> and real difference in inner nuclear size
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Based on the strengths of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests used, these results should be interpreted
        as trends between the tissues. As observed in non-diabetic
        aged transparent and age-related human cataractous lenses,
        it appears that nuclear fiber cell compaction is
        responsible for these differences.
        It should be noted that any study that utilizes tissue
        processing for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron microscopy</ENAMEX> is subject to potential
        morphological artifacts due to fixation. Every effort has
        been made in this study to minimize the potential
        occurrences of such artifacts by utilizing proven
        preservation methods for lens tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . It is
        possible that the processing may dehydrate the presbyopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> nuclei; however, the potential structural changes may
        occur on too small a scale to significantly affect the
        gross measurements made here.
        To relate these variations in compaction to diabetes
        and/or cataractogenesis, statistical testing was performed
        using previously collected non-diabetic data. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungerford</ENAMEX>'s review of the size of the lens in ocular
        disease he comments that the rise in overall lens growth
        rate observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diabetic lens</ENAMEX> can be almost entirely
        attributed to increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cortical</NUMEX> thickness, with relatively
        insignificant width changes in the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Later
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulations</ENAMEX> concerning the mechanism of this growth
        included increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> formation, enlarged fiber cell
        volume, and decreased nuclear compaction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 20</ENAMEX> ] .
        Parameter comparisons of transparent aged human lenses to
        those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> did not yield statistically significant
        results, indicating little difference in average nuclear
        compaction between the tissues. Our previous study
        demonstrated a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> average decrease in elliptical angle and
        A-P axis measurements between aged transparent lenses and
        those of age-related nuclear cataracts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ; this is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> the same amount of change reported here between
        transparent and nuclear cataractous diabetic lenses (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>
        decrease). This suggests that the compaction changes
        observed in this study are not necessarily a direct effect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> itself, but are perhaps due to morphological
        changes in the nuclei undergoing cataractogenesis. The role
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> does appear to play, however, involves the
        onset age of cataract. Though we cannot deduce the age of
        cataract onset in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, we do know the age at which
        the cataract was considered advanced and removed by an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ophthalmologist</ENAMEX>. In our comparisons, the average age for
        the age-related nuclear cataract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        whereas that for the cataractous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diabetic group</ENAMEX> in this
        study was only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years old</TIMEX>. These results suggest an
        age-related acceleration of cataract formation in persons
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies have documented a
        link between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and senile cataract formation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years</TIMEX> and younger [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Conversely, a number of studies have shown little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of nuclear cataracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        . Though this relationship continues to be debated, as are
        the underlying physiological mechanisms, premature
        opacification may occur due to an increased susceptibility
        to oxidative damage.
        Although the exact details concerning the cause of
        compaction remain unknown, some features of the
        multifactorial process are understood. The morphological
        changes described in the inner nuclear areas are a direct
        result of the change in A-P axis length. This change in
        length has an observable effect on the reduction of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior FN elliptical angles, and manifests
        itself in the EN as accordion-like membrane folds along the
        straight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. This phenomenon suggests a loss of
        cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and a decrease in nuclear cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osmolarity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . The tendency of lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to
        self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> and the release of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to the bulk
        water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> can lead to greater cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dehydration</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 32</NUMEX>
        ] . The end result is a decrease in cell volume without the
        loss of cell surface area, producing an EN with measurably
        shorter fiber cells with increased membrane complexity.
        In conclusion, this study is in agreement with our
        earlier finding that nuclear fiber cell compaction in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> is a normal and measurable process with advancing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>;
        the process of cataractogenesis appears to have a profound
        effect on the extent and severity of compaction in the
        nucleus. The osmotic swelling of the cortex in typical
        diabetic lenses is not matched by comparable water uptake
        in the nucleus; in fact, compaction occurs in similar
        fashion to that observed in non-diabetic lenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes</ENAMEX>
        may elicit an increased compaction rate as well as an
        earlier onset of cataract formation, though there may be
        multiple mechanisms of action dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease type</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, or treatment strategy. Further investigations
        employing a broad population of samples with extensive
        medical histories will yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">additional</NUMEX>, more conclusive
        results about the relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and nuclear
        cataract.
