        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The CD98</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4F2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FRP-1</ENAMEX>) molecule, a cell surface
        disulfide-linked heterodimer, was originally described as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell activation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and later was shown to
        provide a co-stimulatory signal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>-mediated T-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD28/CD80/</ENAMEX>CD86
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In other studies, triggering of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> could suppress T cell proliferation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ,
        or promote homotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Also, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> may be a target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> for natural killer cells
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , may mediate fusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> leading to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoclast</ENAMEX> formation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , and may modulate
        hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> molecule is also widely expressed on rapidly
        growing non-hematopoietic cells, where it may modulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oncogenic</ENAMEX> transformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , metal ion transport [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , cell fusion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . CD98 is also expressed on normal
        proliferating tissue such as the basal layer of squamous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> having secretion or transport
        functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Understanding of the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD98</ENAMEX> in
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport has been greatly enhanced with the
        recent cloning and characterization of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light
        chains. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Distinct CD98</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> appear to mediate
        distinct amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport activities (for review see [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] ).
        Several lines of evidence now suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> may
        modulate the functions of integrins. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins may act together during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> co-stimulation
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . A genetic screen revealed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> may indirectly
        influence integrin affinity for ligand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Also,
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX> appeared to modulate integrin-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> in two separate studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In addition,
        antibodies to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD98</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX> integrin promoted cell
        fusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1 and β2</NUMEX> integrins
        blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monocyte cell</ENAMEX>-cell fusion and aggregation functions
        induced by an anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Finally, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX>, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX> integrin has been implicated in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] .
        The biochemical mechanism by which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> and integrins
        functionally interact remains unclear. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> specifically with immobilized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrin
        cytoplasmic tail fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> under very mild detergent
        conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , but CD98 has not
        yet been shown to interact physically with intact β1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrins</ENAMEX>. We began the present study by searching for
        integrin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in an unbiased manner (i.e. we
        were not specifically looking for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX>). We utilized a
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> screening method involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation of integrins under non-stringent
        detergent conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . Using this approach, we
        have previously discovered specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between
        particular <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins and other cell surface molecules
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD147/EMMPRIN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and various tetraspanin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transmembrane-4 superfamily</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 32 33</NUMEX> ] . In
        this report we demonstrate for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that CD98
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> and specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with intact β1
        integrin heterodimers. Specific CD98-integrin interaction
        occurs in the context of low density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-lipid
        microdomains, possibly resembling lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rafts</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        Several important signaling molecules, including activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCK</ENAMEX> are present in organized raft-type
        microdomains, and integrity of these microdomains is
        necessary for T cell receptor signal transduction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ]
        . Our present discovery that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">integrins</ENAMEX> specifically
        associate with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CD98</NUMEX> in lipid microdomains helps to explain
        the functional connections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between β1</NUMEX> integrins and CD98
        during T cell costimulation, monocyte fusion, and
        elsewhere.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Identification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> as a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">β1 integrin</NUMEX>-associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were immunized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MTSV1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> human mammary
          epithelial cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> hybridomas were
          generated. Upon monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> screening, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> were
          identified that co-immunoprecipitated integrins without
          recognizing integrins directly. Of these, one recognized
          CD63 as reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mAb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6B12</ENAMEX>) recognized a disulfide-linked cell surface
          heterodimer consisting of an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> kD heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          kD light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
          From I 125surface-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">HT1080</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mAb</ENAMEX> 6B12
          immunoprecipitated a heterodimer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85 and 35</NUMEX> kD under
          reducing conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, lane a, solid arrows) and a
          single protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> kD under non-reducing
          conditions (not shown) but no other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> bands when
          lysates were prepared in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XI 00</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>.
          However, in the less stringent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brij 58</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>, mAb
          6B12 co-immunoprecipitated an integrin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> band
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">130 kD</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, lane b, dotted arrow). Similar results
          were noted when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHAPS</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Brij 99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> were used
          (not shown).
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B12</TIMEX> resembled the
          disulfide-linked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85 and 35</TIMEX> kD subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ]
          , they were compared to authentic CD98 as precipitated
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mAb 4F2</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mAb 4F2</ENAMEX> and mAb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B12</TIMEX> precipitated
          identical patterns of cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, as seen by
          reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, lanes c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). Furthermore,
          preincubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates with mAb <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4F2</ENAMEX> resulted in
          loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mAb 6B12</TIMEX> (not shown).
          Upon addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> to cell lysates, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mAb</ENAMEX> 6B12
          immunoprecipitated only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> kD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, consistent
          with specific recognition of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. Flow
          cytometry of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells transfected</ENAMEX> with CD98 heavy chain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> confirmed that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is the 6B12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Also, by flow cytometry the 6B12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> was present at high levels on all human cell
          lines tested (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 20</NUMEX>) as expected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX>-integrin association
          To identify the integrin-like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> kD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>(s)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitating with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX>, immune complexes prepared
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HT1080</NUMEX> cells were dissociated and reprecipitated
          with mAb against various cell surface molecules. From
          CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX> we recovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX> integrin, but
          not other cell surface molecules, including the LDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I, the metalloprotease regulator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMMPRIN</ENAMEX> (CD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD71</TIMEX>, or CD 109 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Several
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins that are abundant on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HT1080</NUMEX> cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(α3β1, α2β1, α5β1</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α6β1</NUMEX>) also could be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-precipitated from CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C).
          Using the same experimental conditions, we were unable to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">detect α4β1</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> immunoprecitates prepared from the
          rhabdomyosarcoma cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX>, the lymphoblastoid cell
          line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Molt4</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K562</NUMEX> cells transfected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α4</NUMEX> integrin
          (not shown). However, we did observe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α4β1</NUMEX> integrin in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM manganese (not shown). The precise role
          of manganese is unclear. Incubation with anti-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          'activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TS2/16</NUMEX> (not shown) did not mimic
          the effects of manganese on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α4β1</NUMEX>-CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Thus,
          although manganese is well known to "activate" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] , this activation may not be relevant to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α4β1</NUMEX>-CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Comparison of material isolated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from CD98</TIMEX> immunoprecipitates with total amounts of each
          integrin on the cell surface indicates that approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of each integrin is associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C,
          compare lanes a-d with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">e-h</ENAMEX>). In a reciprocal experiment,
          CD98 heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was re-precipitated from an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX>
          integrin immunoprecipitate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B, lane a) at a level
          comparable to re-precipitated CD81 (lane b), a molecule
          shown previously to associate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">integrins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          . Results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Bindicate</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX>-integrin
          complexes are distinct from previously described
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">integrin-CD81</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 40</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">integrin-CD147/EMMPRIN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Because not all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins associated constitutively
          with CD98 (in the absence of manganese), the α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> must
          help regulate specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Notably,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3</NUMEX> with a truncated cytoplasmic tail, and wild-type α3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> equally well with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, lanes c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>).
          Thus, specificity for constitutive association with CD98
          may reside in integrin α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> extracellular or
          transmembrane domains. To check whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> is a ligand
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX> integrin, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K562</NUMEX> cells transfected with
          wild type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3</NUMEX> mutants deficient in adhesion to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3</NUMEX>
          ligands laminin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">W220A</NUMEX>) and invasin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Y218A</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
          All of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> constructs associated with CD98
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E). Notably, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> had no inhibitory effect on
          constitutive integrin-CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (not shown).
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> itself does not appear to be acting as an
          integrin ligand. We were unable to demonstrate any
          changes in the adhesive functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> upon
          CD98-transfection. However, functional effects of
          transfected human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD98</ENAMEX> could be overshadowed by an excess
          of endogenous hamster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX>.
          Next we asked whether clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD98</ENAMEX> would induce
          selective clustering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins. On the surface of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A3</NUMEX> cells, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> was clustered by incubation with
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> mAb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4F2</TIMEX>, followed by incubation with rabbit
          anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Subsequent incubation with anti-α<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mAb</ENAMEX> directly conjugated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alexa-488</ENAMEX> revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α3β1</NUMEX>
          was highly clustered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C), unless pre-clustering of
          CD98 was omitted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). In contrast, staining with
          anti-α<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-Alexa-488</ENAMEX> mAb revealed a diffuse pattern of
          staining, regardless of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3D</TIMEX>). If
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alexa-488-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conjugated antibodies</ENAMEX> were added, no
          staining was observed (not shown). Immunofluorescent
          staining of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">α3β1 and CD98</TIMEX> showed that they were
          distributed similarly on the cell surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HT1080</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A3</NUMEX> cells and partially co-localized (not shown).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteines</ENAMEX>. Each of these cysteines was mutated to serine,
          and the effects on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> were
          evaluated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stably</ENAMEX> expressed human CD98 heavy chain C330S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> retained association with endogenous murine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells, comparable to that seen for wild type CD98
          heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C109S</TIMEX> mutant showed no
          detectable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Murine
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), and mutant and wild type forms
          of CD98 (see legend) were expressed at comparable levels
          in each of the transfectants. Notably, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          CD98 heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was maintained for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C330S mutant</ENAMEX>, but was lost for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C109S</TIMEX> mutant (not
          shown), in agreement with previously published results
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cysteine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">109</ENAMEX> is required for disulfide
          linkage to the light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . These results suggest
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> might be necessary for
          CD98-integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the
          light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is more proximal to the integrin. When
          suitable anti-light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> reagents become available, this
          could be directly tested in covalent crosslinking
          experiments. In this regard, we have thus far been unable
          to crosslink CD98 heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> directly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrin,
          using either membrane-permeable or membrane-impermeable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crosslinkers</ENAMEX> (not shown).
          Another possibility is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> may
          target the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> heterodimer to the specific membrane
          domain where interactions with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins may be
          localized. To test the latter hypothesis, we compared the
          total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrin distribution with the distribution of
          the fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins complexed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> on HT
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1080</TIMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins were
          predominantly present in the dense membrane fraction on a
          sucrose gradient, the subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins complexed
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> was localized to the 'light' membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX>. These fractions typically contain caveolae and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'membrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rafts</ENAMEX>' thought to be enriched in active
          signaling complexes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 43</NUMEX> ] . The fraction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX>
          integrins detected in the light membrane fractions
          represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 5%</NUMEX> of total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β1 integrins</NUMEX> (based
          on the densitometric analysis, not shown). Though
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caveolin</ENAMEX> is present in the same fractions as
          CD98-integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, it does not co-immunoprecipitate
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> under these conditions (not shown) and thus is
          not part of integrin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Similarly,
          GPI-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as CD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TM4SF proteins</ENAMEX> such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX>, and other transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as
          CD147<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/EMMPRIN</ENAMEX> can be found at substantial levels in light
          membrane fractions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] , and our unpublished
          results), and these also did not co-immunoprecipitate
          with CD98 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrin</ENAMEX> has another level of specificity beyond simply
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localizing in light membrane fractions.
          Finally, to see whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> might
          help to target the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> to the light membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX>, we looked at the distribution of the wild type
          CD98 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> in the sucrose gradients (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The majority of wild type CD98 heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> mutant (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C330S</NUMEX>) are localized to the light
          membrane fraction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55-60%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D), whereas the C109S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> is partially shifted to the dense fractions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          in the light fraction, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in the dense fractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4D). These results are consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light
          chain targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD98</TIMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> to light membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX>. It is perhaps not surprising to observe ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C109S</NUMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> mutant remaining in the light
          membrane fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>), considering that the CD98
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimer</ENAMEX> retains partial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          transport function even in the absence of a disulfide
          linkage of the subunits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Notably, transformation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> cells caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of CD98 heavy
          chain required its association with the light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, and
          a missense mutation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C109</TIMEX> eliminated its transforming
          activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD98 protein</ENAMEX> was recently shown to associate
          specifically with integrin β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic tail
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> detergent
          conditions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may speculate that the use of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> may have allowed maintenance of CD98
          microdomains, needed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> interaction. In this regard,
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX>, many transmembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> remain in the light membrane fractions of a
          sucrose gradient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] . Although the role of the
          CD98 light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was not addressed in the earlier study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] , we assume that it may have played a key role.
          Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant β</ENAMEX> chain
          cytoplasmic tail fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, in the absence of the α
          chain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , is consistent with our observation that
          the α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic tail is not needed for
          integrin-CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, we observed
          CD98 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several β1</NUMEX> integrins, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α4β1</NUMEX>.
          Thus for intact integrins in the context of mammalian
          cells, the integrin β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> apparently does contribute to
          the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX>. The α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> might
          provide a level of specificity by changing the
          conformation of the β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and/or by providing an
          additional site of interaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX> light or
          heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>.
          Because our integrin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was observed in
          light membrane fractions and not in dense sucrose
          gradient fractions, and because we could not capture the
          complex by covalent crosslinking (not shown), the
          interaction may not be direct. Nonetheless, an abundance
          of evidence points to the functional relevance of this
          complex (references above). Furthermore, integrin
          αVβ3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have considerable functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relevance</ENAMEX>, despite being found only under relatively mild
          detergent conditions (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brij</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>) and exclusively in
          the light membrane fractions of a sucrose gradient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we show a highly specific biochemical link
        between intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX> integrins and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD98</ENAMEX>, as demonstrated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reciprocal</ENAMEX> co-immunoprecipitation and co-clustering
        experiments. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CD98</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrins</ENAMEX> appears to occur in the context of an ordered
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microdomain</ENAMEX> (as evidenced by co-localization in light
        membrane fractions of sucrose density gradients), and
        appears to require the light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX>. These results
        may help to explain recent reports that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD98</TIMEX> may modulate
        integrin ligand binding, adhesion, signaling, T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-stimulation and cell fusion functions.

          cells and retroviral infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells was

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> experiments
          For immunoprecipitations, labeled cellular proteins
          were extracted with lysis buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the indicated
