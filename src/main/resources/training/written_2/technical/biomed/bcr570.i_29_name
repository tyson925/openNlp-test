        A number of studies have evaluated possible associations
        between a polymorphism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the cytochrome P450c17Î±</TIMEX> ( 
        CYP17 ) gene and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Cytochrome
        P450c17Î± functions at key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> points in human
        steroidogenesis, catalyzing the ovarian and adrenal
        biosynthesis pathways for androstenedione, the immediate
        precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testosterone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> have
        been described in this gene: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C â†’ T</ENAMEX> transition at
        nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5471</TIMEX> in intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> â†’ A transition at
        nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region promoter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        , and a thymidine substitution for cytosine at nucleotide
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region promoter that creates a 
        Msp AI recognition site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Msp AI</ENAMEX> polymorphism gives rise to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genotypes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A1/A1, A1/A2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/A2</ENAMEX>). Although it was
        hypothesized that the polymorphism (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>) could result
        in an additional Sp1 binding site with enhanced promoter
        activity and an increased rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ,
        this was not found in experimental studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Nonetheless, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies found that both premenopausal and
        post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with the variant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> had higher
        levels of circulating estrogens than those with common
        alleles, indicating that the polymorphism may be in linkage
        disequilibrium with another functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> or that
        it may affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> levels through some other mechanism [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Effects of the variant 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> on risk have been
        investigated in a number of studies, with some
        corroborative results and some conflicting results. In a
        multiethnic cohort, while breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk was not
        significantly increased for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A2</NUMEX> allele [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A2</NUMEX> allele did confer more than a twofold increase in
        risk among those with advanced disease. Furthermore, late
        age at menarche was protective only among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were
        homozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A1</TIMEX> allele. The findings regarding age at
        menarche were confirmed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 9</NUMEX> ]
        and in a recent meta-analysis involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4227</ENAMEX> cases and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4730</TIMEX>
        controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . These studies did not find that the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> was associated with
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, even when stratifying by stage of
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 9 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Feigelson 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] recently reported that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were less likely than those with A1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy, presumably
        because of fewer menopausal symptoms due to higher
        circulating estrogens. It is clear that hormonal milieu
        differs for pre-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        and there is evidence that risk factors for disease
        diagnosed among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may also differ,
        particularly those related to hormonal factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        The majority of previous studies did not evaluate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> separately by menopausal status, particularly
        for effect modification by 
        CYP17 on relationships between breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other risk factors. In the present study, we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaluated</ENAMEX>, separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, whether the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> was independently
        related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk or could possibly act through
        modification of other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk factors.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>
          These research data were collected in an earlier
          case-control study (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986-1991</TIMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">617</NUMEX> premenopausal and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">933</NUMEX> postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
          The detailed methods have been reported elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] .
          The protocol for the present study was reviewed by the
          Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board of the State University of New</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York at Buffalo</ENAMEX> and by all of the participating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Informed consent was received from all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> for the interview and for the medical record
          review. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> diagnosed with incident, primary,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologically</ENAMEX> confirmed breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were identified at
          all major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>. They
          were frequency matched by age and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of residence
          with controls randomly selected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Vehicle</ENAMEX> lists (< <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Administration</ENAMEX> rolls (> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years</TIMEX>). Interview
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> included medical, reproductive, dietary, and
          lifestyle histories. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were born in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of
          birth of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> or, to a
          lesser degree, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were considered postmenopausal if they were
          younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50 years</TIMEX> and had natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">menopause</ENAMEX>, had
          bilateral oophorectomy or had irradiation to the ovaries.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years and older</TIMEX> were considered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postmenopausal</ENAMEX> if they had ceased menstruation. At the
          end of the interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were asked to provide a blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> of
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> agreed. Among pre-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
          there were no significant differences in socioeconomic,
          hormonal, reproductive, or dietary factors between those
          who gave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and those who refused. Among
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, controls who gave a blood specimen
          had a greater mean number of pregnancies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>,
          
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) than those who
          declined. There were no other significant differences
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Laboratory analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was purified by standard phenol/chloroform
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX> from frozen
          blood clots. PCR conditions were based on those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 ng</NUMEX>) was amplified using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          pmol primers (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-CAT TCG CAC TCT GGA GTC-3</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-AGG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TTG GGG TAC TTG-3</ENAMEX>') in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneAmp PCR</ENAMEX> buffer (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 mM KCl</TIMEX>,

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkin Elmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norwalk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amplitaq DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U; Perkin Elmer</ENAMEX>) with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">deoxynucleoside</NUMEX>-3'-triphosphates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.87 mM</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction volume. The PCR
          reaction had an initial melting temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>) followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of melting (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">94Â°C, 1 min</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annealing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">56Â°C, 1 min</ENAMEX>), and extension (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">72Â°C, 1 min</ENAMEX>). An
          extension period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> followed the final
          cycle. The resulting product (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">459 bp</ENAMEX>) was subjected to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Msp AI digest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. Gel electrophoresis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX> agarose; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) of the resulting fragments
          revealed either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A1</TIMEX> homozygote (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">459 bp</ENAMEX>), the A2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygote</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335 and 124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>), or the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A1/A2 heterozygote</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">459, 335</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">124 bp</NUMEX>).
          Results of genotyping for the study were read from the
          gel by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 20%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were repeated for quality control. The assay
          was validated by confirming polymorphic Mendelian
          inheritance patterns in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> cell lines ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>), each encompassing three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generations</ENAMEX> (data not shown; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cell Repository</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coriell Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Tests for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium among controls
          were conducted using observed genotype frequencies and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ï‡</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2test</ENAMEX> with one degree of freedom. To evaluate the role
          of 
          CYP17 on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk through
          mediating mechanisms, we first assessed differences in
          age at menarche, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first full-term pregnancy,
          difficulty in becoming pregnant, and use of hormone
          replacement therapy and oral contraceptives among
          controls according to the 
          CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement use were only available
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were postmenopausal, and few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> beyond
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">menopause</ENAMEX> had a history of oral contraceptive use, so
          only premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were included for those
          analyses. Odds ratios and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals were
          calculated using unconditional logistic regression to
          evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between 
          CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          risk separately for premenopausal and post-menopausal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The odds ratios were adjusted for age, education,
          age at menarche, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first pregnancy, reported family
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, history of
          benign breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at menopause for
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
          Associations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hormonal</ENAMEX>/reproductive factors and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> were further calculated within genotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strata</ENAMEX>. We performed tests for interaction by computing
          the crossproduct of the independent variables ( 
          CYP17 and reproductive factors
          whose effects on risk varied by genotype) and including
          it in a regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> entered
          separately.
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> in the present study were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX>
        pre-menopausal and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The mean age
        among premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47 years</TIMEX>, and the average age
        of postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63 years</TIMEX>. We evaluated
        information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of origin and
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of origin. In this fairly
        homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> decent. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A Ï‡ 2test</NUMEX> of observed versus
        expected genotype frequencies for 
        CYP17 among premenopausal women
        suggested a slight deviation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        equilibrium. However, this difference was not statistically
        significant ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>). The genotype frequencies
        for post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> followed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equilibrium</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX>).
        Hormonally related factors appeared to vary by 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Among both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premenopausal</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, those with at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> A2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> were more likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A1/</ENAMEX>A1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX> to experience early menarche, although differences
        were not statistically significant. There were also slight
        differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at menopause, with a somewhat later
        average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at menopause for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A1/A2</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/A2 genotypes.</ENAMEX> Interestingly, postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> A2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> were also less likely to experience
        difficulty in becoming pregnant and, correspondingly,
        tended to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at an earlier age. Contrary to
        findings by Feigelson 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> did not influence the
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy or oral contraceptives
        in the present data.
        Neither homozygosity nor heterozygosity for the A2
        variant was associated with increased breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In fact, there appeared to be inverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the A2</TIMEX> allele and risk, particularly
        among postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, in both unadjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and
        those models adjusted for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk factors.
        Because there were few differences in relationships for
        those with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A1/A2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX>, these categories were
        collapsed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> evaluated between genotype
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk factors.
        Associations between breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and hormonal risk
        factors by 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> are presented in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. For premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late age</TIMEX> at menarche was
        significantly protective only among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A1/</ENAMEX>A1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>). This effect was not seen among postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Differences in risk were also noted for other
        factors. Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first full-term pregnancy
        significantly increased risk among premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> only
        for those with the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A1/A1 genotype.</ENAMEX> Risk was also elevated
        among these allele <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> if they reported use of oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraceptives</ENAMEX> and difficulty becoming pregnant. For
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">A2 alleles</ENAMEX> who were
        most at risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late age</TIMEX> at first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full-term</TIMEX> pregnancy and with difficulty becoming pregnant.
        While effects of age at menarche, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first full-term
        pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use were only
        significantly notable among premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with A1
        alleles, interactions were not statistically significant
        (data not shown).
      
      
        Discussion
        We found in the present study that while the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Msp AI</ENAMEX> genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> did
        not increase breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk, it appears to modify the
        associations between hormonal and reproductive factors and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX>, those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with higher estrogen levels in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premenopausal</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, were more likely to
        share characteristics associated with greater fertility.
        They were more likely to have an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at menarche,
        less difficulty becoming pregnant, an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full-term</TIMEX> pregnancy, and later age at menopause.
        In accordance with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 9 12 16</NUMEX> ] ,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later age</TIMEX> at menarche was protective against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        only among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> homozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A1</TIMEX> allele, although we
        noted this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> only in premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late age</TIMEX> at first full-term pregnancy and oral
        contraceptive use increased risk only among premenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women homozygous</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> alleles. Relationships were not as
        notable among postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, although late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> birth increased risk only among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with A2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>. These apparent discrepancies by menopausal status,
        although they may be due to chance, could reflect
        differences in the nature of premenopausal and
        post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> etiology, particularly in
        relation to steroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>.
        The initial report of increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        and modification of other risk factors by variability in 
        CYP17 was promising for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        research [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Steroid hormones</ENAMEX> clearly play a large role
        in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> etiology, and identification of risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with genetic differences in their biosynthesis
        and metabolism could greatly elucidate mechanistic pathways
        and make inroads towards prevention for public health.
        However, this report was followed by a number of studies
        that did not corroborate those early results. As more
        studies have been conducted, relationships between the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk
        have become clearer, particularly through the repeated
        findings of modification of risk through other reproductive
        factors. Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies have noted higher estrogen
        levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A2 alleles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 23</ENAMEX> ] , it is
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with these genotypes have more lifetime
        exposure to circulating steroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> that is not
        abrogated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later age</TIMEX> at menarche or by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> age at
        first full-term pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use may
        similarly only impact risk in an environment of lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogens</ENAMEX>.
        Experimental studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] have shown that the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-flanking
        region of the gene does not influence binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sp1</TIMEX>, as
        previously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conjectured</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 20</ENAMEX> ] . Nonetheless, studies in
        both premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have
        found that those with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> have higher circulating
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX>. Thus, while the mechanism
        whereby the 
        CYP17 polymorphism increases serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> levels has not been identified, it is probable
        that there are either effects that have not yet been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elucidated</ENAMEX> or that the site is in linkage disequilibrium
        with another polymorphism that alters the function of the 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX>.
        Results from this study may be impacted by a number of
        factors, foremost of which may be small sample size. While
        we had data on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">395</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, stratification by menopausal
        status and additional stratification by 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> to evaluate
        differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk factors resulted
        in small data points in some cells, and therefore results
        are interpreted cautiously. Nonetheless, results support
        findings from a number of studies and are consistent with
        findings from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest studies to date: those from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and the study of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, our findings are in
        accordance with those of a meta-analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> case-control
        studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, genotype frequencies among premenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> deviated slightly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium,
        although these differences were not statistically
        significant. Previous studies have shown a range of
        genotype distributions. In a recent meta-analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ye</ENAMEX> and
        Parry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/A2</ENAMEX> genotype prevalence ranged from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 to 23.4%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> different studies.
        This variability in estimates could be due, in part, to
        small sample sizes. In the present study, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>
        of premenopausal controls and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of post-menopausal
        controls had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX>, which falls well within
        this range. However, the prevalence of heterozygotes was
        higher in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> than in other studies. It is
        unlikely that this could be attributed to population
        stratification, since western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> is a fairly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">homogeneous</ENAMEX> area, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were all of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> descent
        and, for the most part, at least second-generation or
        third-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. Another possible explanation
        for the higher proportion of heterozygotes could be
        genotyping errors, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        read the gels and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 20%</NUMEX> of the samples were repeated
        for quality control. Furthermore, assays were validated by
        confirmation of polymorphic Mendelian inheritance patterns
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> cell lines ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>), each encompassing three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, our findings support those of several other
        studies that variant 
        CYP17 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alleles modify breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        risk associated with several hormonal and reproductive
        factors. These collective findings may point the way toward
        further investigations into the role of metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in steroidogenesis and metabolism in relation
        to breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target women</ENAMEX> who may be most at
        risk for the disease.
