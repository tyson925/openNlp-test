        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> inbred (RI) strains have been used
        extensively to map a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendelian</ENAMEX> and
        quantitative traits [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. They offer compelling advantages
        for mapping complex genetic traits, particularly those that
        have modest heritabilities. Each recombinant genome is
        replicated in the form of an entire isogenic line [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>] and variance associated with environmental factors
        and technical errors can be suppressed to low levels. This
        raises heritability and improves the prospects of mapping
        underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We have recently
        used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> to map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> that generate variation in the
        architecture of the mouse centralnervous system (CNS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. The main advantage in this
        context is that the complex genetic and epigenetic
        correlations between interconnected parts of the brain can
        be explored using complementary molecular, developmental,
        structural, pharmacological and behavioral techniques. Gene
        effects can also be tested under a spectrum of
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perturbations</ENAMEX> and experimental conditions. RI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> can be exploited to expose gene-environment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and gene pleiotropy. These important facets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX> can only be explored with difficulty using
        conventional mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in which each genome is
        unique.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> is that genotypes
        generated by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using a variety of methods
        can be pooled to generate high-density linkage maps. As a
        result, loci that segregate in RI sets can often be mapped
        with impressive precision without genotyping. This
        attribute was a significant advantage before the advent of
        efficient and easy PCR genotyping methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Unfortunately, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> databases of RI
        genotypes have accumulated many typing errors. Each error
        expands distances between marker loci and degrades linkage,
        inevitably blurring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between genotypes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> and making it difficult to map traits, whether
        they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mendelian</ENAMEX> or quantitative in nature. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of false recombinations has become extreme in
        common RI sets. For example, the map of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the
        complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> data set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> linked marker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> and is an astonishing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,305 cM long</NUMEX>. This map is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> times the length of an F2 map of
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over three</NUMEX> times the length expected
        of an RI map of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The accumulation of typing
        errors has led to efforts to reconstitute maps using
        curated subsets of markers for which genotypes can be
        adequately and independently verified. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampson</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] assembled maps for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXA</ENAMEX> strains
        that improved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of this set. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taylor</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] assembled comparable high-quality maps
        for the complete set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> strains that are based
        almost entirely on easily typed and verified microsatellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>.
        Our aims complement this previous work. Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aim
        has been to generate reliable high-resolution genetic maps
        for each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> widely used sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXA</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXB</ENAMEX>. These RI sets all share <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> alleles,
        and they can be assembled into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> superset consisting of
        just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> lines. The introduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> intercross
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIX</ENAMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Threadgill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>] provides an
        impetus to precisely define recombination breakpoints in RI
        strains. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIX</ENAMEX> progeny are isogenic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F1</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> made between
        pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and one well</NUMEX>-mapped RI
        strains could in principle be used to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,050</NUMEX>
        well-defined isogenic and non-inbred RIX genometypes.
        Our second aim has been to describe the recombination
        characteristics of typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains and their chromosomes
        in a more theoretical context. We have empirically tested
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldane-Waddington</ENAMEX> equation of map expansion in
        sibmated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX>. We have also tested relatedness among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RI</ENAMEX> lines, and measured deviations from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        equilibrium associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-30 years of inbreeding,
        genetic drift, mutation and selection.
        Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> aim has been to help resolve a serious but
        unrecognized problem in QTL mapping that arises from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-syn-tenic</ENAMEX> genetic correlations within mapping panels.
        Genetic correlations between intervals on different
        chromosomes can be high in RI sets and this can result in
        spurious results and false-positive QTLs. We provide
        detailed correlation matrices that can be used to detect
        and control for non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">syn</NUMEX>-tenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        Many of the files that form part of the analysis
        reported in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are available as Additional data
        files.
      
      
        Results
        
          RI consensus maps of mouse chromosomes
          
            Undiscovered recombinations and SDPs
            The number of recombinations in RI sets still
            significantly exceeds the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> that have been
            unequivocally defined. On the basis of current marker
            density we estimate that we have defined from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB-BXA</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> (CXB) of the total set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4,800</NUMEX>
            known recombination breakpoints (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 2, 3</ENAMEX>). There
            are likely to be another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> breakpoints that we have
            not yet detected. To discover 623 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,492</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> set required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">936</NUMEX> selected markers.
            Recovering the majority of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> could
            require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 1,000 to 1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> placed marker
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>. The density of informative microsatellite markers
            is not yet sufficient to define many more SDPs in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set, but once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> and microsatellite maps have been
            fully integrated into chromosome sequence databases, it
            will be straightforward to generate additional markers
            and use these to define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 5,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> in the BXN
            set (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] for integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche SNP</ENAMEX> data
            files).
          
          
            Error checking
            To minimize genotyping errors we retyped many
            markers, particularly those that were associated with
            unusually large numbers of recombination events. We
            were particularly interested in minimizing the number
            of genotypes that appeared to be associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            closely located recombination events - what are
            sometimes referred to as double-recombinant haplotypes.
            These haplotypes appear to be the result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            separate crossover events, one of which is just
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> to a particular marker and the other just
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distal</ENAMEX> to the same marker. For example, the haplotype
            of a short chromosome interval - 
            BBBNBBB - is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            recombinations that flank the central marker with the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genotype. Because of
            interference, the occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recombinations
            within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> cM is highly improbable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an F2</TIMEX> intercross,
            and consequently, double recombinants are often used as
            a measure of genotyping error or incorrect marker
            order. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX>, however, recombination events
            accumulate over many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinations</ENAMEX> can therefore be extremely close to each
            other and can produce true double-recombinant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX>. It is therefore necessary to verify, rather
            than discard, all apparent double recombinants in RI
            strains. We checked our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker genotypes</ENAMEX> and the
            majority of microsatellite markers typed by other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> for whether they were associated with
            double recombination events in one or more RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>.
            When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> strains contributed to double
            recombinants, we usually retyped all strains.
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150</TIMEX> double-recombinant haplotypes (and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> false recombinations) were eliminated in the
            process of error checking. Our genotypes therefore
            differ from those of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microsatellites</ENAMEX> reported in
            original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> and listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX> Genome
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Informatics Release 2.5</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In a few instances, our
            revisions have generated new (but verified)
            double-recombinant haplotypes.
            We discovered unexpected polymorphisms at several
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> in a few lines and all were scored as unknown (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>)
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The clustering of aberrant products in AXB13
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AXB14</ENAMEX> is consistent with the common origin of these
            strains from a partly inbred progenitor line. However,
            the genotypes of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of strains (for
            example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB1 and AXB3</TIMEX>) are generally completely
            independent.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs in several intervals gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bands
            consistent with a genuine heterozygous genotype.
            Heterozygous loci are rare among fully inbred RI
            strains but they are fairly common among new BXH
            strains that were genotyped at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th</TIMEX> to 16th
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of inbreeding. In scoring recombination
            frequency we treated all heterozygous loci and
            intervals as if they had not been typed. Mutations in
            microsatellite loci may be responsible for some
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Changed locus order
            The order of loci of the BXN consensus maps
            generally conforms to that of the chromosome committee
            reports (CCR) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead</ENAMEX> genetic maps
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 130</NUMEX> instances we have changed the
            order of loci over short intervals. For example, 
            D1Mit276 and 
            D1Mit231 on proximal chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
            do not recombine in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2</ENAMEX> cross, but in the BXN
            set there is a single recombination between these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXA11</TIMEX> that is most consistent with a
            reversal of order relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCR</ENAMEX> (compare the
            columns labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCRcM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITcM</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXNcM</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
            The only nontrivial discrepancy was on proximal
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. We reordered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 32</NUMEX> loci on
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> to improve linkage statistics. We have
            not attempted to integrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> data with numerous
            other mapping panels, and it is likely that original
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCR</ENAMEX> order will often be well supported by other large
            mapping panels or rapidly improving physical maps. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX>
            sequence data will soon resolve these minor
            inconsistencies.
          
          
            Reassigned microsatellite loci
            A number of microsatellite loci were reassigned to
            locations on chromosomes other than those expected on
            the basis of their original assignments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
            Mapping data in one or more of the RI sets is
            consistent with a reassignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> microsatellite
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> to different chromosomes. All of these
            reassignments are provisional, particularly those with
            LOD scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> cases (for
            example, 
            D10Nds10 ) we have reassigned
            microsatellite loci typed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> that
            now are linked to new and firmly mapped markers. All
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> used to amplify these microsatellites (except 
            D10Nds10 ) were resynthesized to
            confirm that they are identical to those originally
            specified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dietrich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
            Individual maps are based on genotypes of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as few as</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 markers</TIMEX> (chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 129</NUMEX> makers
            (chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) per chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The mean
            separation between markers is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> cM (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cM</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCR</ENAMEX> maps as a reference and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX> cM using the
            RI maps themselves). When the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">577</NUMEX> markers that do not
            have unique SDPs are excluded from the analysis, the
            average separation increases to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> cM using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCR</ENAMEX> maps
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> cM using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> data. Typical resolution of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set for mapping a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendelian</ENAMEX> trait is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2 cM.</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 90%</NUMEX> of the mouse genome is currently less
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cM from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">typed microsatellite marker</ENAMEX> in the RI
            set. The asymptotic resolution of the set of BXN
            strains given infinitely dense maps in which every
            possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDP</ENAMEX> has been characterized would average about
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> cM. There are currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> poorly typed
            regions. These regions are operationally defined as
            intervals of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 12</NUMEX> cM between adjacent markers
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The largest is on proximal chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 9 and 21</TIMEX> cM (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Strain independence
            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains share common haplotypes and
            recombination breakpoints. This non-independence of RI
            lines will distort genetic maps. To systematically
            search for and eliminate partial duplicate RI lines we
            constructed a genotype similarity matrix for all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> analysis program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Qgene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
            An example of a small part of this matrix is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6for</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXB</ENAMEX> set.
            As already noted by Sampson 
            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of AXB
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXA</ENAMEX> strains show high genetic similarity, and
            genotypes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> strains should be excluded from most
            genome-wide mapping panels. Phenotype data obtained
            from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> listed below should
            often be collapsed and treated as a single strain.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 1</ENAMEX> consists of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXA8 and BXA17</TIMEX>, which have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.8%</NUMEX>
            genetic identity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> are known to be
            polymorphic, 
            D3Mit392 and 
            D6Mit108 . The polymorphism at 
            D6Mit108 has been verified using
            independent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains. BXA17
            is actually a direct derivative of BXA8 separated in
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996-97</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Any divergence in genotypes or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> is due to the recent generation and fixation
            of new mutations in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separately maintained
            lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2</ENAMEX> comprises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB18</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB19</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB20</TIMEX>. There
            is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 to 99%</NUMEX> identity among any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 3</ENAMEX> comprises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB13 and AXB14</TIMEX>, which have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>
            identity. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of strains were treated as
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three single</NUMEX> strains when analyzing recombination
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>.
            The mean allele similarity of the remaining strains
            averages almost exactly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. The distribution of values
            is symmetrical about the mean (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) with the great
            majority of strain pairs falling in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-70%</NUMEX>
            similarity. The highest remaining similarities within
            RI sets are between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD13 and BXD41</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AXB6</ENAMEX> and
            AXB17 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXHB2 and BXH9</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AXB6</ENAMEX> and AXB12
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD28 and BXD33</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD19 and BXD29</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>) and
            AXB11 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB14</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>). These values are not
            significantly higher than the similarity scores
            typically noted across RI sets.
          
          
            Residual heterozygosity
            In theory, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75,000 genotypes</NUMEX> generated
            across the genome of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains should detect only
            a single residual heterozygous loci at generation F55
            of inbreeding (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, lowest line; the inbreeding
            coefficient at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F55</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99998812</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from most lines
            was extracted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> at F generations between F20
            and F70 (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). We detected a
            total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> strains that were still heterozygous (BXA20
            from 
            D1Mit77 to 
            D1Mit490 ; AXB21 from 
            D2Mit102 to 
            D2Mit420 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB24</TIMEX> at 
            D3Mit62 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXA23</TIMEX> at 
            D5Mit95 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB3 and BXA16</TIMEX> at 
            D12Mit167 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXA20</TIMEX> from 
            D13Mit224 to 
            D13Mit254 ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD31</TIMEX> at 
            D9Mit243 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD34</TIMEX> at 
            D7Mit281 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD37</TIMEX> at 
            D1Mit83 ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXH12</TIMEX> at 
            D1Mit417 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXH10</TIMEX> at 
            D12Mit167 ; CXB8 from 
            D1Mit361 to 
            D1Mit291 ). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> were
            taken from single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of each strain and for this
            reason these estimates of residual heterozygosity
            underestimate the total heterozygosity about
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold.
            The central part of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is interesting
            because it is heterozygous in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BXD37,</ENAMEX>
            BXH12 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BXA20</ENAMEX>). There is also an interval of
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2.5</NUMEX> cM that is apparently maintained in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosity</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB21</TIMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Such
            maintenance should be accompanied by reduced fecundity
            in this line if homozygotes are lethal or sublethal.
            This would account for poor breeding performance. It is
            also possible that the heterozygosity is the result of
            a mutation, but if this were the case we would expect
            novel length polymorphisms, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were
            usually the expected parental lengths.
          
        
        
          Structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> genomes
          
            RI mean map lengths
            The mean frequency of recombinations, 
            C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between two</NUMEX> linked markers in
            an RI strain generated by breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> is
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> 
            c /(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> 
            c ) where 
            c is the recombination fraction
            per meiosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. An infinitely dense RI map
            should average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times the length of the
            conventional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-generation F2 map. Most expansion is
            achieved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few generations</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F7</TIMEX> the
            genetic map is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately three</NUMEX> times the length of
            an F2 map (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The expectation is that a map
            based on loci that are spaced at intervals of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 cM</NUMEX> ( 
            c = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> in an intercross) will
            be expanded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.66</NUMEX>-fold. Similarly, a
            low-density map based on markers that are spaced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cM</TIMEX> intervals will be expanded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold. F2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N2</ENAMEX> maps
            generated using uniform typing procedures typically
            have a cumulative length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,300 to 1,400 cM</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five</TIMEX>
            conventional crosses that we generated (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four F2s</TIMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N2</NUMEX>, each genotyped at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">91 to 148 loci</TIMEX>) average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,320</NUMEX>
            ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> (standard error of the mean)cM in length. In
            comparison, the fully error-checked native <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> map is
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3.6-</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>-fold longer, or a total of
            4,786 cM. The expansion averages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.4</NUMEX>-fold
            when the comparison is made to the CCR consensus maps
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The expansion between common
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> and distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8</NUMEX> in
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.8</NUMEX> in chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>. In general, the
            expansion estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>-fold agrees well with the
            Haldane-Waddington expectation, given a mean spacing
            between neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cM</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
            only recombines with half the frequency of the
            autosomes, and for this reason its expansion is only
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>-fold.
          
          
            Comparison with other maps
            The summed length of all chromosomes is
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1,413</NUMEX> cM when values are converted from
            RI recombination frequencies to those expected of
            typical single-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> meiotic maps. The
            corresponding CCR maps have a cumulative length of
            1,494 cM between the same markers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead</ENAMEX>
            microsatellite maps have a cumulative length of
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1,384</NUMEX> cM. The agreement is excellent.
          
          
            Recombination density per RI strain
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual RI</ENAMEX> strains contain an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
            recombinations with a range that typically lies between
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 and 60</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> CXB <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are associated
            with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">671</NUMEX> recombinations, an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
            per strain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">BXD strains</ENAMEX> are associated with
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1,500</NUMEX> recombinations, an average of about
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> per strain, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately one recombination</NUMEX> per
            centimorgan on a standard genetic map (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 2, 3</ENAMEX>).
            There is considerable variation in the total load of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinations</ENAMEX> and map expansion per strain: from a low
            expansion of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.24</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD40</TIMEX> (the RI strain with the
            fewest recombinations) to a high expansion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6</NUMEX>
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXH6</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). These estimates are systematically
            deflated by a failure to discover recombinations in
            sparsely mapped regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where the
            recombination fraction 
            c is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 0.1</NUMEX>) but are
            inflated by residual typing errors and errors of marker
            order.
          
          
            Recombination density per chromosome
            Single chromosomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains accumulate as many
            as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> recombinations, but across the whole set the
            recombination density averages <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2.4 recombinations</NUMEX>
            per chromosome. The mean extends from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.47</NUMEX>
            recombinations for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.88</NUMEX> for chromosome
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Poisson</ENAMEX> model fits the distribution of
            recombination events per chromosome reasonably well and
            most chromosomes have insignificant <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square (Χ</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>)
            values (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). High Χ 2for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> chromosomes
            are generally due to a small number of apparently
            highly recombinant chromosomes in particular strains.
            These highly recombinant chromosomes are probably
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with residual typing errors or incorrect
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> order.
          
          
            Segregation distortion and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
            equilibrium expectation of allele fixation in RI
            sets
            In the absence of selection, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> should have inherited 
            B alleles at each marker. A Χ
            2statistic can be used to assess whether the
            segregation ratio of a particular marker differs
            significantly from expectation. Only the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> intervals
            listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7have Χ 2values</ENAMEX> that are significant at
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> level. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> intervals are biased in
            favor of 
            B alleles. This is most extreme
            on chromosomes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 15 and X</ENAMEX>, where there are about twice
            as many strains with 
            B alleles as 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> alleles. The opposite pattern
            is seen on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 11 and 12</TIMEX>. Given the large
            number of comparisons, many instances of segregation
            distortion may be type-I statistical errors. In
            collaboration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mammalian Genotyping Service</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>], we recently genotyped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> advanced
            intercross between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> (genotype data
            for this cross is available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]). It is therefore
            possible to test whether similar segregation distortion
            patterns are present in this related multi-generation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>. The short answer is that the segregation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distortions</ENAMEX> noted in the BXN RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are replicated
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> intervals. The correlation between ratios of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> (logarithm of 
            B : 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ) in these intervals was
            positive ( 
            r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>). It is therefore likely
            that several of the intervals marked in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 7with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asterisks</ENAMEX> represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that harbor loci that
            affect fitness.
          
          
            Non-syntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important issue in using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains for mapping
            complex traits is that intervals on different
            chromosomes can become tightly associated in a
            statistical sense. This non-syntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> can
            arise either as a result of random fixation of alleles
            on different chromosomes during the production of RI
            strains or can arise as a result of selection for
            particular combinations of alleles on different
            chromosomes. Similar patterns of non-syntenic
            disequilibrium are common in recently admixed human
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and often lead to false-positive signals
            when mapping complex traits. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, even a modest
            selection coefficient expressed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten generations</TIMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inbreeding</ENAMEX> can generate positive and negative
            non-syntenic disequilibrium throughout the genome. For
            example, if the combination of 
            B alleles on distal chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
            and 
            B alleles on proximal chromosome
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> is favorable for fitness, then these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intervals
            will effectively be in linkage disequilibrium in the
            final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disequilibrium</ENAMEX> can also take the form of
            strong negative correlations and 
            B alleles may be associated
            strongly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> alleles.
            We searched for marked deviations from the expected
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-locus equilibrium by making a series
            of large correlation matrices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> of marker pairs
            (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] for a variety of correlation matrices). This
            was done for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set and for the constituent
            RI sets. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7summarizes</NUMEX> the most extreme positive
            and negative correlations among the composite set of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> independent BXN RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. Whether due to chance
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX>, selection or epistasis, non-syntenic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> of the sort illustrated in Figure 7are a
            major source of both false-positive and
            false-negativeresults in using RI sets for mapping. It
            is helpful to examine the correlation matrix once a set
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> has been provisionally mapped to see how summed
            effects of single or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple QTLs</ENAMEX> might produce
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spurious QTLs</ENAMEX> in regions not actually associated with
            trait variance.
          
          
            Controlling for non-syntenic association
            Non-syntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> among loci and intervals
            can be computed in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> mapping. It is
            therefore possible to statistically control for genetic
            correlations that are built into different RI sets. For
            example, in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7the</NUMEX> genotypes at marker 
            D1Mit83 can be partly predicted
            by genotypes at markers on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> and chromosome
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. If the genotype at 
            D1Mit83 is treated statistically
            as a dependent variable and markers on chromosomes 7
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are used as predictors, then one can compute the
            residual genotype, or independent contribution of 
            D1Mit83 and any other marker or
            interval to the quantitative trait. Unlike composite
            interval mapping, the set of controlled loci will
            necessarily vary for each marker and interval. This
            procedure will reduce type I error but will produce a
            regional loss of statistical power. The correction will
            introduce blind spots in a genome scan. In extreme
            cases (usually small RI sets), intervals that can be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perfectly</ENAMEX> predicted by small numbers of other
            non-syntenic intervals will effectively be eliminated
            from a mapping study and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> in those intervals will
            be missed. For this reason, it is essential to perform
            each a genome-wide scan both with and without control
            for non-syntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> may
            occasionally be assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more physically
            unlinked intervals.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Information content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strain sets
          Despite the accumulation of genotypes in RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>,
          these genetic resources have often not been typed with
          sufficient density to accurately define the frequency and
          positions of recombination breakpoints. For example, in
          the venerable set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> CXB <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 11</NUMEX> unique SDPs
          had been assigned to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> before our work. With a
          more dense map of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> that is now based on
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> markers, we have recovered a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          recombinations on this chromosome - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinations</ENAMEX> per strain. The positions of these
          recombinations have been defined with a precision that
          ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 to 6.0 cM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> cM average) as referenced
          to standard CCR maps. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> SDPs are
          represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more marker, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 17</NUMEX> SDPs
          remain to be defined and these SDPs unfortunately cannot
          be predicted unambiguously. For example, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent
          markers 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> and 
          D have genotypes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBCCC</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCCCC</ENAMEX> , then there must be at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unrecovered SDP between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> and 
          D . Until we actually type markers
          in the 
          P-D interval, we do not know
          whether the intercalated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDP</ENAMEX> is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCCCC</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBCCC</ENAMEX> . To discover the undefined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDP</ENAMEX> could require considerable effort especially if
          available polymorphic markers on the 
          P-D interval have been exhausted.
          All unrecovered SDPs lower the information content of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set. Their absence can significantly reduce linkage of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendelian</ENAMEX> and quantitative traits that are unlucky
          enough to be controlled by loci in the intervals with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambiguous SDPs</ENAMEX>.
          How dense should a marker map be to define more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX>? With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">862</NUMEX> markers, we
          were able to define <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> of all likely SDPs
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> CXB <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. In the collected set of BXN RI
          strains, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 23%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">estimated 5,000</NUMEX>
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX> have been confidently defined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX>. We can estimate the density of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> map that would be necessary to define <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX>. For example, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> set, if one assumes a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> and independent distribution of breakpoints across
          strains and a random distribution of markers, it would
          take a map with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,700</NUMEX> markers to define <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,536</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDPs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set
          Most mapping software applications used by mouse
          geneticists are adapted for diallele crosses of various
          types. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> data set was therefore formatted in a way
          that collapses all non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">B6</NUMEX> alleles into a single 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. The collected set of just
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> strains can be used without complication with
          software such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Map Manager QTX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. This procedure
          was used largely as a convenience to integrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> genetic
          maps. There are self-evident limitations that follow from
          the collapse of all non- 
          B alleles (A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BALB/cByJ</ENAMEX>) into a single category. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geneticists</ENAMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set should therefore begin virtually all studies by
          mapping with the individual component RI sets (AXB-BXA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXB</ENAMEX>) to detect possible levels of allele
          effects (an allelic series). The 
          B allele is a common feature and
          may be a useful reference point for estimating
          hierarchies among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> parental alleles. This
          separate, set-by-set analysis prevents the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> alleles from averaging out, as
          they might in a cumulative analysis (the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> alleles will often have effects
          that are both higher and lower than that of the 
          B allele). Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set
          includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">490</NUMEX> common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker loci</ENAMEX> and a consistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> and integration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> maps, it is
          now much easier to combine linkage likelihood ratios from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> sets. A simple method based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s
          method is described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] in a
          study that pooled data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> and BXH sets. More
          sophisticated methods for automatically extracting and
          combining linkage statistics from the multi-allele BXN
          sets will require modification of mapping application
          programs. Pooling data in this way will require judicious
          and well justified statistical procedures. Combining data
          across the BXN sets can easily degrade a linkage
          analysis. The statistical exploration of different
          combinations of RI sets provides new degrees of freedom
          which may generate false-positive results, but which may
          also generate interesting hypotheses regarding QTL
          action.
          The BXN map could be refined further by interpolating
          genotypes of other markers and genes that have been
          mapped independently by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in single RI
          sets. Our BXD database includes only microsatellite loci,
          for example, and excludes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> potentially
          informative polymorphic loci, many in interesting genes.
          We regret having to use this procrustean approach, but
          because of the difficulty of verifying genotypes and
          because numerous loci introduce improbable
          double-recombinant haplotypes, we have used exclusive
          criteria to ensure high-quality maps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX>
          interested in recovering some of this lost data should
          refer to the comprehensive lists of genotypes maintained
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mouse Genome Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. However, genotypes of
          any marker and strain that introduce new
          double-recombinants into the BXN map should be regarded
          with a high level of suspicion.
        
        
          Power and precision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains
          A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> will have twice
          the genetic variance of a matched set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 F2</NUMEX> progeny
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> backcross progeny. This
          increased genetic variance comes at some cost: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX> F2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> meioses and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 200</NUMEX>
          unique haplotypes per chromosome (the non-recombinant
          chromosomes reduce this number somewhat). <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> are
          fully inbred and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> lines represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 100</NUMEX> unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> per chromosome. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains
          therefore has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately twice</NUMEX> the load of
          recombinations as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 F2s</ENAMEX>. For a semidominant Mendelian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trait</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains therefore provide roughly twice the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> F2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progeny</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> N2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progeny</ENAMEX>. When both genetic variance and recombination
          load are considered together, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains
          should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately four</NUMEX> times as effective (precise)
          for mapping complex traits as an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times as
          effective as a backcross. This estimate assumes that only
          a single RI <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is sampled per line; a strategy that
          is appropriate for mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, microsatellites and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mendelian</ENAMEX> loci.
          The gain for mapping quantitative traits will be
          greater and will depend strongly on the heritability and
          to a lesser extent on the degree of dominance at each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belknap</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] has compared the relative power of RI
          strains and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2</ENAMEX> intercrosses under several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and
          assuming different levels of heritability. For
          morphometric traits such as brain weight, with narrow
          sense heritabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> will
          provide a level of precision and power that is
          conservatively equivalent to that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> F2
          intercross progeny. The advantage shifts further in favor
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> for traits with lower heritability. Power
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key issue in QTL mapping, but at present,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> - the ability to fine-map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subcentimorgan</TIMEX> intervals suitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
          analysis - is the hurdle, and one that would be less
          imposing with improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI resources</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Making better RI resources
          The usefulness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> for mapping is largely a
          function of the number of known recombination breakpoints
          and useful polymorphisms that they harbor. All current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RI sets are small, and consequently the most common
          criticisms leveled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> mapping with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> is that
          the precision and power are poor and that only those QTLs
          with unusually large effects can be detected reliably.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set provides only a partial solution to this
          problem by expanding the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains that can be
          treated statistically as a complex cross. A much better
          long-term solution is to generate larger sets of RI
          strains for high-precision complex trait analysis. RI
          sets consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 to 1,000</NUMEX> lines could provide very
          impressive power and subcentimorgan precision. The LXS
          set (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80-90</NUMEX> strains) and the enlarged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> set (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70-80</NUMEX>
          strains) mentioned above will soon provide practical
          demonstrations. Generating large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> is an undertaking,
          but the effort is dwarfed by ongoing mutagenesis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generating</ENAMEX>, maintaining and storing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> RI lines could be a well justified expense given
          the long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of large RI sets in tackling
          otherwise intractable problems in functional genomics -
          gene pleiotropy, genetic correlations, epistasis and
          reaction-norm genetics - in a mammal.
          Several other factors make this idea significantly
          more attractive. First, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set can be produced using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> inbred strains. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> strains could
          in principle be combined to make RI sets that segregate
          for a greater variety of polymorphisms. This addresses
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> that a single conventional diallele <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set
          may not be useful for studying particular traits because
          of a paucity of relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymorphisms</ENAMEX>. Such multi-way RI
          lines buck the reductionist trend of eliminating genetic
          complexity by isolating gene variants on inbred
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backgrounds</ENAMEX>, but such complexity has its advantages and
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> would provide welcome models for exploring
          genetic background effects that plague much of the
          current work on transgenic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, by genotyping and selectively breeding the most
          highly recombinant animals it should be possible to
          generate RI strain sets with map expansions that
          significantly exceed that predicted by the
          Haldane-Waddington equation, an equation that assumes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> mating of sibs. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>- to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-fold expansion
          should be attainable, particularly if recombinations are
          tracked before and during the inbreeding process (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Recombination density could be further increased by
          starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> from either advanced intercross
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progeny</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] or heterogeneous stock (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) as was
          done in making the new set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> strains mentioned
          above. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the power of RI sets can now be amplified
          significantly by use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> intercross (RIX) and RI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backcross</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIB</ENAMEX>) designs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. Finally, large RI sets
          will largely eliminate the problem of non-syntenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> well justified objection to using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains
          to map quantitative traits is that fully inbred strains
          may not provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative phenotypes</ENAMEX> precisely
          because they are inbred and subject to often severe
          inbreeding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. The abnormal genetic architecture
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">inbred strains</ENAMEX> and the fixation of multiple alleles
          that affect fitness will almost inevitably produce
          unusual pleiotropic and epistatic effects on a range of
          complex traits. Outliers are common on these and other
          inbred lines. Can the strain means be trusted?
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIX</ENAMEX> progeny provide a surprisingly simple solution to
          this problem [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIX</ENAMEX> progeny made among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          a single diallele <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set will be similar to an F2
          intercross with an inbreeding coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. Crosses
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of completely different RI sets (for
          example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AXB1</TIMEX> crossed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LXS80</NUMEX>) will have an inbreeding
          coefficient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>. In this respect they will be
          more appropriate models of human genetic variation, but
          with the remarkable advantages of completely defined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genometypes</ENAMEX> and the option of generating large numbers of
          isogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> and their RIX progeny
          
            Mapping modifiers of dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> using RI
            backcrosses
            Knowing the precise location of breakpoints in RI
            lines also makes it possible to map modifier loci of
            mutations by making and phenotyping a set of different
            F1 crosses made between inbred carrier stock (for
            example, a knockout carried on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> background)
            and fully typed RI lines. A set of these RI backcrosses
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIB</ENAMEX>) has a genetic structure similar to a conventional
            N2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backcross</ENAMEX>, but there is no need to genotype any of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIB progeny</ENAMEX> and they have the major advantage that
            isogenic progeny can be typed to obtain much more
            reliable trait scores. This method does depend on
            either a dominant or semidominant mutant allele, since
            the phenotype must be detectable on a significant
            fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIB progeny</ENAMEX>. Provided that this
            condition is met, the costs and logistics of this type
            of screen may be more modest than a typical screen for
            modifier loci. The analysis can be carried out without
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> and using replicated genomes to test for
            environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulators</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> and sequencing efforts
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the widely used sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains that we
          have typed and analyzed share <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> as a parental
          strain. The genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> is currently being
          sequenced as part of a public effort [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and for this
          reason, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set for converting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> to
          strong candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will increase significantly in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. It will become far easier to
          generate complete lists of positional candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          then to obtain data on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and protein expression
          patterns. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other major strains incorporated into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BXN set - A/J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J -</ENAMEX> are also being sequence by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celera Genomics</ENAMEX> and, in principle, it will be possible to
          compare sequences of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> to
          generate lists of possible allelic variants in positional
          candidate genes. The recent cloning of the 
          Sac locus that controls <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and
          saccharin preference on distal chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, provides a
          good example of the increased power of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
          analysis. This locus was initially mapped using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> BXD
          stains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>]. In the absence of high-resolution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mapping</ENAMEX>, but with astute analysis of human and mouse
          sequence data, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sac</ENAMEX> was identified almost
          simultaneously by several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as the gene for the T1R3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47</TIMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>,
          the identification of genes associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> will
          probably be no more of a special exception than the
          cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mendelian genes</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX>.

          Strains and DNA
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from most recombinant inbred and parental
          strains was purchased from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>, Bar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB</ENAMEX> and BXA
          strains and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> BXD <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> CXB <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">BXH strains</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> strains total. For visual clarity in
          this paper we have dropped hyphens and substrain
          designations from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strain names. For example, strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BXD-1/Ty</ENAMEX> is referred to as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Databases</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX>.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory Mouse DNA Resource</ENAMEX>
          was extracted from individual male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The RI animals
          that we genotyped were, with a few exceptions, the
          progeny of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> serial matings between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on the particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that we used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> and the current generation of RI <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is
          available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> new BXH strains
          generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Siracusa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> Medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was extracted from the spleen
          using a high-salt procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. The new BXH strains
          were generated by crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J- c2J/c2Jalbino</ENAMEX> males
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and their production and genotyping
          will be described in detail elsewhere (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Siracusa</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.W.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the new BXH albino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are no longer available (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1 and E2</TIMEX>). We
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">genotyped 107</ENAMEX> RI <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. Several sets of strains share
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 8</ENAMEX>). We deleted redundant strains
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AXB18</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ABX20 and BXA17</TIMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strains BXHD1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXHE1 and BXHE2</TIMEX> were backcrossed to
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> before sibmatings were begun.
          There is therefore a pronounced increase in the number of
          chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> inherited from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX> These
          N2-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> were dropped from most aspects of
          the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> genome structure. BXD41 has been
          extinct for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> and was never completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inbred</ENAMEX>. Although we have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for this strain, our sample
          is from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F12</NUMEX> generation male. We did not genotype BXD41
          in this study.
          We refer to the collected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> set
          because each of the strains includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> or B) as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the parental strains - the common substrain
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXH</ENAMEX>, and the

          Microsatellite loci distributed across all autosomes
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome were typed using a modified version

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] described in detail at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,773 primer</NUMEX> pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MapPairs</ENAMEX>) that selectively
          amplify polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> microsatellite loci were

          ng genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Reactions were set up using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipetting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. A loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dye</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cresol</ENAMEX> red) was added to the reaction before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were carried out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well microtiter plates.
          We used a high<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-stringency</NUMEX> touchdown protocol in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annealing</ENAMEX> temperature was lowered progressively from 60°C
          to 50°C in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2°C</NUMEX> steps over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six</TIMEX> cycles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>].
          After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were run on cooled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX>
          Metaphor agarose gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMC Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockland ME</ENAMEX>), stained
          with ethidium bromide, and photographed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gel</ENAMEX> photographs
          were scored and directly entered into relational database
          files.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen primer</NUMEX> pairs were resynthesized at our
          request by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX> using the original sequence

          verify that our chromosome reassignments of
          microsatellite loci were not due to the use of incorrect
          primer sequences.
        
        
          Common markers
          When we began this work <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> markers had
          been typed on each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major RI sets. We were
          able to increase this to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">489</NUMEX> markers. We relied on these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> to assemble consensus RI maps. The additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">986</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> markers were typed by us and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXN</ENAMEX> genotype database includes
          1,578 markers. Any pair of RI sets share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 500</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> fully genotyped markers. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest
          RI sets - AXB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BXA</ENAMEX> and BXD - have been typed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">591</NUMEX> common
          microsatellite markers.
        
        
          Databases
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relational</ENAMEX> database files were assembled from the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-2000</TIMEX> chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> reports, the Portable

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT/Whitehead SSLP</ENAMEX> database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 8</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. These files
          contain a summary of information on chromosomal positions
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,332</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> microsatellite markers and information on an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and markers. We have included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuffield Department of Surgery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nds</ENAMEX>) microsatellite
          markers for which primer sequences are available.
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> devoted to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set were
          assembled from text files downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX>
