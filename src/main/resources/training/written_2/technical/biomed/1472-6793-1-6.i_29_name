        Although electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been obtained in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">conscious mice</ENAMEX>, currently reported techniques require
        restraint [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] or anesthesia and surgical implantation of
        telemetry devices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Anesthesia, however, may
        depress cardiovascular function, and adequate recovery
        after transmitter implantation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 3 weeks</TIMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 5</ENAMEX>]. Accordingly, we developed a non-invasive technique
        for obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> in conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by placing the animal
        on a platform embedded with paw-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> electrodes
        connected to an amplifier. This method is much less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traumatic</ENAMEX>, requires no anesthesia or surgery, and promotes
        rapid screening of large quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> data we
        obtained non-invasively in conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are comparable to
        those recently published using surgically implanted
        telemetry devices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4</ENAMEX>]. To test the efficacy of our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, we evaluated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of either sex, of several
        strains, and of different ages. Moreover, we tested whether
        our system could detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> alterations in response to
        pharmacological challenge by isoproterenol. The baseline
        heart rate data and responses to the Î²-adrenergic agonist
        isoproterenol we recorded non-invasively in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
        comparable to data published using invasive methods[ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. We
        developed an ECG signal processing, analyzing, and database
        Web portal, which we named e-MOUSEâ„¢, accessible to the
        biotechnology community. The advantages of the ECG
        recording and analyses paradigm we developed are clear,
        given the high cost of breeding, housing, and transporting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and the call for comprehensive yet widely available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotyping</ENAMEX> tests [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        Results
        We recorded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> each of
        C57BL<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129/Sv</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB/N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> inbred strains
        commonly used to model human diseases. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> ECG
        recording from an adult male <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are conscious, baseline artifact and
        noise are apparent in the unfiltered signals. Yet, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-waves and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>waves are discernible by eye and
        interpretable by the software algorithmic processing of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> digitized at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per second. Analyses of
        the digitized signals via e-MOUSEâ„¢ demonstrated
        significantly faster heart rates in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">741 Â± 2 bpm</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">692 Â± 5 bpm</NUMEX>,

        results in 129/Sv <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>), again
        demonstrating faster heart rate and shorter QRS duration
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> interval in female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in age-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.
        Rate corrected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> (QTc) in male 129/Sv <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was
        significantly longer than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66.7 Â± 1.9</NUMEX> ms vs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58.4 Â± 1.6 ms</NUMEX>, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Gender differences in
        heart rate were also apparent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB/N</ENAMEX> strain [<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">736 Â± 5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bpm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">706 Â± 7 bpm</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>),

        Reducing the spacing of the electrodes allowed us to
        record ECGs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-day</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-day</TIMEX> old nursling

        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-day-old C57BL/6</TIMEX> nursling
        female is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Heart rate variability in
        neonates was significantly less than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>

        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Heart rate in nursling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX> was significantly slower than in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">655</ENAMEX>

        gender differences in heart rate we observed in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        were absent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-day old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-day</TIMEX> old neonates. Upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weaning</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days old</TIMEX>), however, gender differences in heart
        rate became apparent [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">697 Â± 14</ENAMEX> bpm in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mice</ENAMEX>
          To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to describe
          gender differences in heart rate in genetically
          homogenous strains of conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>] and in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] have shown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> to have
          faster heart rates than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, differences that disappear
          with age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 13</TIMEX>]. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and in 129/Sv <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          we found that conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> exhibited significantly
          faster heart rates than male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB/N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          however, we noted faster heart rates and briefer ECG time
          intervals in male compared to female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell et</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, using implanted transmitters, reported slightly but
          insignificantly faster heart rates in male compared to
          female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FVB mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Gender and strain differences in
          heart rate may reflect differences in hormone activity,
          which are known to affect cardiovascular autonomic
          regulation differentially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and
          vary among mouse strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Our strain-dependent
          observations agree with results of invasive studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>] and support the importance of genetic factors in
          influencing heart rate.
        
        
          Developmental Changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Conscious</ENAMEX> Neonatal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mice</ENAMEX>
          We found that the gender differences apparent in
          C57BL<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> were absent in nursling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Reduced
          activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX> could contribute to reduced heart
          rate and heart rate variability. However, observations in
          quietly resting adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), monitored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min
          after placement on the recording <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, of reduced
          heart rate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">471 Â± 20 bpm</NUMEX>) and increased heart rate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 Â± 6 bpm</NUMEX>) suggest that the results in
          neonates may be attributable to reduced sympathetic and
          parasympathetic signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The time-domain heart
          rate variability data we obtained non-invasively are
          comparable to those obtained using implanted telemetry
          devices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 16</ENAMEX>]. The developmental changes in heart rate
          we measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> parallel those in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neonates</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 17</TIMEX>], lambs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and newborn rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Moreover,
          our observations in neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are in agreement with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et al.</ENAMEX> who reported progressive and significant
          shortening of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> intervals during neonatal development [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. Accordingly, our approach, adaptable to the study of
          small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that might otherwise die from anesthesia or
          surgery, might be valuable in examining developmental
          changes and abnormalities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 17</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sympathetic Stimulation in Conscious</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mice</ENAMEX>
          The blunted heart rate increase in response to
          Î²-adrenergic stimulation in conscious <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          is consistent with gender related differences in
          baroreflex control of heart rate in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrogen</ENAMEX> has been shown to enhance baroreflex sensitivity
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and attenuate the response of heart rate to
          administration of isoproterenol in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. After
          repeated injections of isoproterenol, heart rate
          decreased and the QRS duration increased significantly in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">male mice</ENAMEX>, but did not change in female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Yet, both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> demonstrated increased sensitivity to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acute isoproterenol</ENAMEX> injection after repeated
          administration that resulted in significant cardiac
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. We observed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> increase in
          heart mass in both sexes after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-days of isoproterenol
          treatment compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with equivolume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX>. Although Î²-adrenoceptor desensitization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] or
          reduced ATPase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] may account for the
          decrease in basal heart rate in the hypertrophied male
          hearts, the increased sensitivity to isoproterenol may
          support the hypotheses of ischemia-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of
          Î²-adrenoceptor kinase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] or modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein
          signaling to preserve adenylate cyclase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
          To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report that describes
          electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">conscious mice</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> segment changes have
          characterized isoproterenol-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ischemia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> consistently developed ST
          segment depression following isoproterenol administration
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> did not remains unanswered. However,
          significant gender-related differences in the expression
          of glutathione <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S-transferases</ENAMEX> (GST) have been observed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, with female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressing significantly more of
          this antioxidant than male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          isoproterenol-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oxidative</ENAMEX> stress may be attenuated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> due to higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Study Limitations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> are sensitive to even modest handling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 8</ENAMEX>] and
          transport [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 32</ENAMEX>]. The ECG indices we measured may
          reflect physiologic responses to the experimental
          environment relative to its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home cage</ENAMEX>. We encourage a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> acclimation period prior to recording data to
          attenuate effects consequent to handling and transport.
          Usually <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> establish contact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 3</NUMEX> electrodes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          limbs within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> after acclimation to record a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuous ECG</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 2 seconds</TIMEX>. The duration
          of the ECG recording should be considered in the
          interpretation of heart rate variability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. The age,
          gender and strain variations in heart rate may reflect
          age, gender and strain variations in physiologic
          responses to transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], handling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], and
          adaptation to repeated measurements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Yet, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-strain differences in heart rate we non-invasively
          obtained after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> recordings of short duration are in
          agreement with invasive experimental techniques intended
          to monitor heart rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caged</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8</ENAMEX>]. Our
          measurements were made in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime hours</TIMEX>, disrupting the
          less active phases of the mouse circadian cycle. Future
          innovation might incorporate an array of conductive
          electrodes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' cages to eliminate the
          effects of handling and transport, and perhaps enable
          timed recordings.

          commonly used inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129/Sv</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB/N</ENAMEX>
          (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME), were housed in
          standard conditions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Resource Facility</ENAMEX>
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston MA</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nursling</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of either sex were examined at
          post-natal day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 12</TIMEX> and returned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>.
          The same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, weaned, were examined at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of
          age.
        
        
          ECG recording
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were gently removed from their cages and
          positioned on the ECG recording platform. An array of
          gel-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> electrodes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Dot; 3 M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>)
          were embedded in the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and spaced to
          provide contact between the electrodes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' paws.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, the spacing between electrodes was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cm, and
          for nurslings, the spacing was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> cm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX>
          paper, with openings for the electrodes, prevented mouse
          urine from short-circuiting the signals. The electrodes
          were connected to an amplifier (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HP78901A,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andover, MA</ENAMEX>) by a shielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-electrode
          lead set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M1605A Snap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andover, MA</ENAMEX>).
          Since even modest handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> may induce alterations
          in heart rate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was permitted to
          acclimatize for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> min prior to collection of baseline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The signals were digitized with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-bit</NUMEX> precision
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI-220</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATAQ Instruments, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>) at a
          sampling rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> samples/<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          sitting or otherwise positioned such that the paws were
          not in contact with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> electrodes, the output from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplifier</ENAMEX> was discarded. Only data from continuous
          recordings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> ECG signals were used in the
          analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were transmitted to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mousespecifics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> Internet site
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouse Specifics, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) using standard
          file-transfer protocols for ECG signal analyses by
          e-MOUSEâ„¢.
        
        
          ECG analyses
          Each signal was analyzed using e-MOUSEâ„¢, an
          Internet-based physiologic waveform analysis portal.
          e-MOUSEâ„¢ incorporates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourier</ENAMEX> analyses and linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">invariant</NUMEX> digital filtering of frequencies below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> and above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> to minimize environmental signal
          disturbances. The software uses a peak detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to find the peak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-waves and to
          calculate heart rate. Heart rate variability was
          calculated as the mean of the differences between
          sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart</ENAMEX> rates for the complete set of ECG
          signals. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stand 2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ndderivatives</ENAMEX> and algebraic "if-thens" search the ECG
          signals for probable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-wave</ENAMEX> peaks and onset and
          termination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>wave is not
          separate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRS</ENAMEX> in rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 34</TIMEX>], there
          have been discrepancies in the definition of the QT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> and reported values [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In accord with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], we routinely included the inverted
          and/or biphasic portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>wave in our
          calculations of the QT interval. We defined the end of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>wave of each signal as the point where the signal
          returned to the isoelectric line [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 35</ENAMEX>] [the mean
          voltage between the preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">P-wave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRS</ENAMEX> interval].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> intervals were rate corrected (QTc) by application
          of the equation recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] for
          use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The software plots its interpretation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>,Q,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> for each beat so that spurious data
          resulting from unfiltered noise or motion artifacts may
          be rejected. e-MOUSEâ„¢ then calculates the mean of the ECG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> intervals for each set of waveforms.
        
        
          Î²-adrenoceptor stimulation
          To test the sensitivity of our system for describing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> alterations in response to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          given either an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/g</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">females</ENAMEX>) dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ml saline or an equal volume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>), twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-days</NUMEX>. ECGs
          were recorded within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> prior to each injection and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX> after each injection to capture the
          peak of the response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. After the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized by intraperitoneal
          administration of pentobarbital (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 mg/Kg</ENAMEX>), consistent
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Veterinary Medical Association Panel</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euthanasia</ENAMEX> guidelines. Excised hearts, excluding atria
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blotted dry</ENAMEX>, were then weighed.
        
        
          Statistics
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are presented as the means Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>. Comparisons
          between genders among strains were performed using
          Student's 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test for unpaired observations.
          Effects of isoproterenol or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saline</ENAMEX> injections within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test for paired observations,
          and between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> comparisons using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test for unpaired observations.
          Differences were considered significant with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We developed a non-invasive technique for obtaining ECGs
        in conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. We developed an Internet-accessible
        portal for analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse electrocardiograms</ENAMEX>. Using this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, we demonstrated significant strain, gender and
        age-dependent differences in electrocardiograms in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Moreover, we demonstrated significant gender-dependent
        differences in the cardiovascular response to
        Î²-adrenoceptor stimulation. Our results may suggest that
        the stimulatory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on cardiac
        function may be more profound in male or masked in female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This non-invasive and rapid ECG phenotyping technique
        may improve the quality and increase the quantity of data
        collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models.
