        The promise of improved outcome with the use of
        hematopoietic growth factors in the treatment of acute
        myelogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (AML) has yet to be realized. In
        several prospective trials, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were randomized to
        either a hematopoietic growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> or a placebo after
        induction chemotherapy in an attempt to accelerate
        neutrophil recovery and improve outcome. These studies
        consistently show accelerated neutrophil recovery without
        an increase in leukemic relapse in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with
        either granulocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> stimulating factor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">granulocyte-macrophage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] Unfortunately these studies have failed to
        consistently show a benefit in terms of remission and
        survival when administered in such an adjuvant fashion. [ 5
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ]
        The hematopoietic growth factors have also been studied
        for their therapeutic benefits when given before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> recruit quiescent
        leukemic blasts into cell cycle thus rendering them more
        susceptible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> specific cytotoxicity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytarabine</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] Several studies suggest a
        potential therapeutic benefit from administering
        hematopoietic growth factors before starting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cytarabine</ENAMEX>-based chemotherapy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        However, the results of larger randomized trials have been
        disappointing. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] Not only have remission and
        survival rates not been increased but the direct effect of
        growth factors on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">untreated leukemia</ENAMEX> has led to severe
        toxic reactions and death. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemotherapy</ENAMEX> also recruits quiescent leukemic blasts
        into cell cycle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> demonstrated in an 
        in vitro model that following an
        initial cycle of chemotherapy "humoral factors" are
        generated which are capable of recruiting quiescent
        leukemic blasts into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] The maximal
        recruitment occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 4 to 6 days</TIMEX> after chemotherapy
        was administered. To apply these observations clinically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were first treated with cytarabine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daunorubicin</ENAMEX>. This initial cycle of chemotherapy was then
        followed by either a second course of cytarabine on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX>
        or AMSA on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 8-10</TIMEX>. This "timed sequential therapy"
        achieved a complete remission rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> in secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] Timed sequential therapy has been employed in relapsed
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">de novo acute leukemia</ENAMEX> and achieves
        complete remission rates comparable to those achieved with
        other salvage chemotherapeutic regimens. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ]
        The combination of timed sequential chemotherapy and
        hematopoietic growth factors allows for an initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoreductive</ENAMEX> course of chemotherapy before starting growth
        factors. The growth factor could then work with the other
        "humoral factors" generated by chemotherapy to maximize
        recruitment of leukemic blasts into cell cycle. Few studies
        have tested this approach. We report the results of a
        clinical trial assessing the potential benefit of adding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> to a proven timed sequential chemotherapeutic
        regimen.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of whom had allogeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> and the other had high
          dose cytarabine as post-remission therapy. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
          patient is alive with recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Treatment-related Toxicity
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced fever in the setting of
          severe neutropenia. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had documented
          infections. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) died from febrile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutropenia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. Other WHO grades III-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> toxicity
          included mucositis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>), diarrhea (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>), skin rash
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>), nausea and vomiting (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>), bleeding (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had reversible hyperbilirubinemia and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) had WHO grades III-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IV renal insufficiency</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced severe neurological toxicity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> with seizure, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with severe vertigo) but those
          complications resolved shortly after the completion of
          induction therapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCSF</ENAMEX> was stopped in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> due to
          persisting peripheral blasts. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> was discontinued
          the peripheral blasts cleared and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> achieved a
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">remission</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Hematopoietic growth factors clearly increase the
        cytotoxicity of cytarabine to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cells 
        in vitro . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX>,
        however, they fail to increase remission rates when started
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 to 48 hours</TIMEX> before any chemotherapy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX>
        ] Potential explanations for the failure of growth factors
        to improve results when administered in this fashion may
        reflect either their adverse effect on a large leukemic
        burden or the necessary delay to the onset of chemotherapy.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] In our study we started growth factors after the
        initial leukemic burden was reduced and then optimized the
        timing of a second course of chemotherapy to take advantage
        of known leukemic blast cell-cycle kinetics. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] Our
        results are comparable to those achieved with other salvage
        chemotherapeutic regimens that employ high-dose cytarabine.
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38 39</NUMEX> ]
        Rather than use a standard high-dose cytarabine regimen
        we employed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX> chemotherapy protocol devised by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archimbaud</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] This regimen is effective
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with relapsed and refractory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> with a
        reported CR rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>. In addition EMA avoids the
        cerebellar neurotoxicity of high-dose cytarabine.
        Recognizing the potential value of hematopoietic growth
        factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archimbaud</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> to the EMA
        regimen beginning on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 4</TIMEX> of treatment. Unlike the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> was discontinued on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 10</TIMEX> of
        treatment. Unfortunately the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> did not
        increase the CR rate when it was compared to placebo in a
        prospective randomized study in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with relapsed and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">refractory AML</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] The results with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX> plus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> are compared with our own results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        Clearly the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in our study was
        different than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studied in the other two
        studies employing the EMA regimen. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is older
        and a majority of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>. These two
        characteristics are among the most predictive of a poor
        outcome. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were untreated at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of study enrollment all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> had secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of
        them had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> in blast crisis unresponsive to hydroxyurea
        therapy. The poor-risk features of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> population
        probably explain our relatively low CR rate compared to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX> studies but also confirm the efficacy of our
        treatment protocol since remissions would only be expected
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with secondary AML
        receiving initial induction chemotherapy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ]
        Our study did not demonstrate a significant advantage to
        the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> to the EMA regimen. Potential reasons
        include the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> failed to increase the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of leukemic stem cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S-phase</ENAMEX> over that
        achieved with chemotherapy alone. Alternatively recruitment
        of blasts into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> may not increase cytotoxicity to a
        clinically significant degree. Finally even if S-phase
        increases cytotoxicity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> is effective in increasing
        the proportion of blasts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S-phase</ENAMEX> these effects may not
        be sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>. In the
        few studies exploring the role of timed-sequential
        chemotherapy as primary treatment for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo untreated AML</ENAMEX> results have
        been more encouraging with high remission rates and
        prolonged survival. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ]
        An initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA-G</ENAMEX> was the effect the
        concurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> and chemotherapy might
        have on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> recovery. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was
        unfounded since the median time to neutrophil and platelet
        recovery is not different than that noted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This observation suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-CSF</ENAMEX> may be
        administered concurrently with chemotherapy without an
        increase in toxicity to normal residual bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>. Other
        studies utilizing hematopoietic growth factors administered
        before and concurrently with chemotherapy also demonstrate
        no adverse effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> recovery. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ]
      
      
        Conclusions
        The treatment of advanced high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> remains
        challenging. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA-G</ENAMEX> in the current study failed
        to demonstrate a better CR rate than published data of EMA
        alone or EMA with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> (EMA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>). However, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> CR rate
        achieved in our cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a higher proportion
        of secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> and older median age suggests that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA-G</ENAMEX> regimen deserves further study in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with less advanced disease.
