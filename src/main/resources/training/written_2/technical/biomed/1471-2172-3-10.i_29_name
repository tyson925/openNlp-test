        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is an emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of important
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have been implicated in the
        regulation of gene expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HIV-1</NUMEX> long terminal
        repeat [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding Î±A-crystallin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , as well as rat 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AGIE-BP1/MIBP1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX> and characterized. In addition, a distant relative 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schnurri</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shn</ENAMEX> ) has been identified in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Although
        little is known about the physiological functions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammalian ZAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shn</ENAMEX> has been shown to be an
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription regulator</ENAMEX> during embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Shn modulates transcription by relieving the
        repression of the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Brinker</ENAMEX> and, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAD</ENAMEX>, mediates transcription response of
        the decapentaplegic pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> gene encodes large sequence-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> with Mr ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> that contain two
        widely separated of C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> finger pairs. Smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein isoforms</ENAMEX> with a single zinc finger pair or with no
        zinc finger pairs can be generated by alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> and relative
        location of the two zinc finger pairs are highly conserved
        among ZAS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from invertebrate to vertebrate
        [Reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ]. Although the zinc finger is a major
        structural motif involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-nucleic acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and is present in the largest superfamily of
        transcription factors, few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain separate zinc
        finger pairs. The ZAS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> zinc finger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX>), tramtrack (with one finger pair), and basonuclin
        (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> finger pairs), constitute a unique class of C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc finger transcription factors.
        [Reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ]. In addition, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> protein
        contains a sequence similar to the serine stripe present in
        basonuclin, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serines</ENAMEX> are located on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side
        of a putative Î±-helix [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 27</NUMEX> ] .
        The ZAS domain is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure unique to the ZAS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> domain denotes a composite protein

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have been characterized by electrophoretic mobility
        shift assays, methylation interference experiments, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">footprinting</ENAMEX> experiments. The cumulative data show
        that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> domains bind a ÎºB-like consensus

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-5</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> KRC,
        Î±ACRYBP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> MIBP1 have also been shown to bind
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binds to the signal sequences

        a sequence in the type II collagen gene enhancer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        MIBP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>-rich element present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">somatostatin type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor gene enhancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to evaluate DNA targets of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> domains from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> independently. We used
        site selection amplification binding assays to select
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> targets recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> fusion proteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing ZAS-N</ENAMEX> or ZAS-C from an initial oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> containing degenerate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mers. After cloning and DNA
        sequencing, the KRC-selected sequence datasets were
        analyzed by the computer program <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Expectation</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maximum for Motif Elicitation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX>) to
        generate sets of position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)
        or motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . When the program was set to identify
        wider sequences (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> nucleotides) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were homologous
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , the ÎºB motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and the canonical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heptamer</ENAMEX> and nonamer elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . However,
        shortening the width of the motifs to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nucleotides, the
        target length for the C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc finger pairs of the tramtrack [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> dataset yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> motifs, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GGTAT</ENAMEX>" and

        forms a sequence homologous to the canonical RSS nonamer,
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GGTTTTTGT</ENAMEX>". Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C pentamer together with
        its complement form the canonical RSS heptamer palindrome
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">CACTGTG</ENAMEX>".

          Amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> targets with a site
          selection amplification binding assay
          In this study, sequences bound by the DNA binding
          domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> were identified in a site selection PCR
          amplification <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding assay</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼g each; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) were initially incubated with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled degenerate oligonucleotides and
          non-specific competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dI-dC</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and unbound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were then resolved
          on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> polyacrylamide gel, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-bound DNA</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> and amplified. The oligonucleotides in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">degenerate pool</ENAMEX> were composed of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25-mer</NUMEX>) in the middle flanked by a specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence BSS1</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end</TIMEX> and the complementary sequence
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BSS2</TIMEX> at the other end. Subsequently, the primer set
          BSS1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSS2</ENAMEX> was used to amplify the recovered
          oligonucleotides by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. The sequence of binding,
          selection and amplification was repeated several times
          before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> were cloned,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> and analyzed. To select optimal binding
          sequences, the stringency of succeeding rounds of the
          selection procedures was increased by using successively
          less (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5Ã—</NUMEX>) fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and more (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4Ã—</ENAMEX>) non-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">competitor DNA</ENAMEX> in each round.
          The formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> was monitored
          throughout the site selection experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical EMSAs</ENAMEX> were performed under more
          stringent conditions than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSAs</ENAMEX> used to purify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-bound oligonucleotides in the site selection
          experiments, using much less fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼g</ENAMEX>) and an excess non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dI-dC</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>).
          Initially, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> formed between the
          degenerate oligonucleotide pool and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C were barely detectable, indicating that both
          fusion proteins bound DNA selectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band 1C</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 1</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent</TIMEX> rounds, the yield of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> increased, suggesting successful
          enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binding sites in the recovered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> during the selection procedures. After
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> rounds of selection and amplification, no
          further increase in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> was observed. The experiment, therefore, was
          stopped at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> round for both fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, in rounds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and five</NUMEX>, a cluster of close
          migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were observed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 5</TIMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX>, the gel
          mobility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> complexes depends on the overall
          mass of the binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and on the possible
          protein induced bending angle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Since a
          single fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was used in each binding reaction,
          the slight variation in the gel mobility of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> may reflect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> has more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were located at different
          positions within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> closely
          migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were clearly seen for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C at rounds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five</TIMEX> (labeled C, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1C, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In addition, another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
          labeled C', which was minor and had significantly slower
          gel mobility was observed in round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 5</TIMEX>). Previously, we showed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as dimers, tetramers, and multiple of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetramers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The significant difference in the gel
          mobility between complex C and complex C' suggested that
          they were likely composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C dimer and
          tetramer, respectively. These data show that the site
          selection amplification binding assays using both KRC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains were efficient in selecting KRC
          targets and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C readily formed highly ordered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> oligonucleotides recovered from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth</TIMEX> rounds
          of site selections were cloned into plasmid vectors. We
          obtained fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> selected sequences and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-C</ENAMEX> selected sequences. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer
          sequences of individual site selected sequences from each
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are shown in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BSS1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 -BSS2</TIMEX> orientation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These
          sequences were named tentatively after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> or ZAS-C
          correspondingly, and a suffix, a number given in the
          order of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid DNA</ENAMEX> preparation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaps</ENAMEX> in the numberings
          represented clones with "empty vectors" and therefore

          from cloning artifacts. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-selected

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZAS-C-44</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZAS-C-45</ENAMEX>) were identical. The redundancy
          observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> amplification appeared to be minimal,
          and therefore, the complexity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-selected DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the datasets should be high.

          nucleotides
          The fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX>-selected sequences (ZAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C-selected sequences (ZAS-C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>) were first analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motif Expectation</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maximum for Motif Elicitation</ENAMEX> (MEME) computer program.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> analyzes input sequences for similarities and
          produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> or motif for each pattern it discovers [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . We set the parameters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> as follows: (i) zero
          or one occurrences of a single motif per sequence; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> as the maximum number of motifs to identify; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) 5
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nucleotides as the range of motif size; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>)
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> strands as input.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 6 W â‰¤ 25</ENAMEX> nucleotides
          generated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single 25-mer</NUMEX> TG-rich motif found in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N-dataset</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). The log
          likelihood ratio (llr), the logarithm of the ratio of the
          probability of the occurrences of the motif given the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">motif</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (likelihood given the motif) versus their
          probability given the background model (likelihood given
          the null <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>), was calculated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">370</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value,
          which is an estimate of the expected number of motifs
          with the given log likelihood ratio, and with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">width</ENAMEX> and number of occurrences, that one would find in a
          similarly sized set of random sequences, was calculated
          to be 1.1e <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-90</NUMEX>. The llr and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value scores suggested that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> discovered were statistically significant.
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C-dataset, a similar pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> also
          generated a TG-rich motif with llr of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222 and an</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.3e -37</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). A sequence comparison showed that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N-PSSM</ENAMEX> was generally homologous to that of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C-PSSM, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guanines</ENAMEX> at both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich
          sequence in the middle. In fact, when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> datasets
          were combined for a pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer motif with llr
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">526 and an</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.9e -134was</ENAMEX> obtained (data not
          shown), suggesting ZAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C have similar DNA
          targets. Furthermore, we were able to align the ÎºB motif,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sb</ENAMEX> sequence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nonamer, and part of the RSS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heptamer</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TGTG</ENAMEX>" with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>). As a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, several sets of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 random 25-mers</NUMEX> were generated
          by a random number generator (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T = 3</ENAMEX>, C = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
          and none yielded any statistically significant PSSMs
          (where E-values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1.0</NUMEX>) when analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> under the
          same settings (data not shown).
        
        
          Motif discovery by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¥ 6 W â‰¤ 15</ENAMEX>
          nucleotides
          A motif of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-nucleotides was obtained in the above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> analysis when widths of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 6 W â‰¤ 25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> were
          set. This is longer than known transcription factor
          binding sites. In addition, the information content
          (measured in bits), which reflects the degree of
          conservation of each column (or position) in those PSSMs
          was relatively low, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>, with an
          overall average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.5</NUMEX> per position (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>). To
          elucidate more biologically relevant motifs with higher
          information content, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> was performed
          with motif widths set to shorter lengths, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> nucleotides. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> discovered for each width
          all had significantly higher overall <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> per position
          and obtained a TG-rich core sequence (data not
          shown).
          Representative results of passes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          nucleotides are presented in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>. In
          those passes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were discovered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>. One motif with a consensus sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G/T</ENAMEX>)-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/A</ENAMEX>)-(A/T)-T-T-T-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>)-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>) was found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX>-dataset, with a llr of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">276</NUMEX>
          and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.5e -18.</ENAMEX> This PSSM was more conserved
          than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> described above, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> for all
          positions ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> and an average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bits/</ENAMEX>position of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We were able to align
          the canonical RSS nonamer and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sb</ENAMEX> with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> motif "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GGTTGTTC</ENAMEX>" was found only in two input
          sequences, had a llr of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9.6e 3</ENAMEX>, and was
          similar to the ÎºB motif (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          A similar pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> discovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> motifs in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C dataset. The major motif had a consensus sequence:
          (A/T)-T-(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/A</ENAMEX>)-T-T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-T-G-G</ENAMEX>, with a llr of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> and an
          E-value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.5e -2</ENAMEX>(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This consensus sequence
          aligns with canonical RSS nonamer. Notably, the terminal
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nucleotides, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-G-T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-G</ENAMEX>", each had an information
          content of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1.5</NUMEX> bits and were nearly invariant in that
          sequence alignment. With respect to the heptamer
          (canonical sequence: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CACAGTG</ENAMEX>), the CAC sequence bordering
          the recombination site is the most conserved segment of
          the sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , and mutation of these nucleotides
          has been found to decrease V(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> joining in transfection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> using recombination substrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Because
          the sequence of the canonical RSS heptamer is palindrome,
          we speculate that the TGTG sequence may be sufficient for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C binding. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> motif also contained a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TGTG</ENAMEX>"
          core sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> sequence was homologous
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nonamer, ÎºB or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sb sequences</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> generated from MEME passes looking for
          shorter motifs yielded more conserved sequences.
        
        
          Motif discovery by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nucleotides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> and tramtrack (TTK) share the same class of C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc finger pairs. The crystal
          structure of the zinc finger pairs of tramtrack-DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplex</ENAMEX> revealed that the two fingers together contacted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          base-pairs "A <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1G 2G 3A 4T 5</ENAMEX>" in the major groove of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:
          The first finger interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A 1G 2G 3while</ENAMEX> the second
          finger interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3A 4T 5</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . By inference,
          each zinc finger pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> might also bind to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentamer</ENAMEX>. To test this hypothesis, a pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> was
          performed with a fixed width of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nucleotides. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> PSSMs
          were obtained for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> dataset. One motif was an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invariant</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GGTAT</ENAMEX>" (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>), and the other was
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). Both motifs when superimposed
          form a sequence that is homologous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nonamer
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GGTTTTTGT</ENAMEX>". It is possible that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> molecules may be
          needed to interact with an RSS nonamer: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> whose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> domains may bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of an RSS nonamer
          while a second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s ZAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domain may bind to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C-dataset, a single motif
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGTG</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G/T</ENAMEX>)" was obtained (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Since the RSS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heptamer</ENAMEX> is a palindrome, it is possible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> KRC
          molecules to bind to an RSS heptamer, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C
          binding to the top strand and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C binding to
          the bottom strand. This notion is consistent with
          previous observation that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules of KRC-ZAS-C are
          required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Further passes of MEME
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were too short to generate statistically
          significant motifs (data not shown). These data suggest
          that with respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> canonical elements,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> binds the nonamer more efficiently while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C binds the heptamer more efficiently, and that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> molecules may be needed to bind a single RSS
          element.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> analysis
          The human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> genomes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> databases
          were searched with the KRC-bound sequences identified as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> by the MEME program with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Alignment</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Search Tool</ENAMEX> (MAST). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> is a program designed to search
          biological sequence databases for sequences that contain
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of a group of known motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Of a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">923,310</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> analyzed, only a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          hits were obtained: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> hits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) and
          10hits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-C</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>). Significantly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of the hits derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C,
          respectively, came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> gene segments of the
          variable region of human or mouse Ig heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. For
          example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C consensus sequence "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ATTTTGTGG</ENAMEX>"
          matches completely with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> nucleotides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nonamer
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> flanking nucleotides of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgH D1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>, D3
          and D4 gene segments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, the MAST
          search identified KRC-selected motifs near two
          chromosomal breakpoints: between a t(<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:14</TIMEX>) translocation
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ig DH2-2</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and the 
          B cell lymphoma <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BCL-1</ENAMEX> ) gene in a mantle cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and at a t(<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:19</TIMEX>) translocation of the 
          myeloid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphoid leukemia</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLL</ENAMEX> ) gene and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ENL/MLLT1/</ENAMEX>LTG19 gene in a T-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The other hits were
          derived from loci of cellular genes, pseduogenes, or DNA
          fragments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . The expression of those genes
          has not been shown to be regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> or other family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, therefore, the biological significance of those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> results is unknown. The result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> analysis
          identifies probable endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">KRC</ENAMEX> targets and suggests
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> might interact with genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> involved in
          legitimate or illegitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination.
        
        
          KRC-bound sequences match <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> within
          endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> receptor gene segments
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> are evolutionarily conserved, the
          sequences of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonamer</ENAMEX> and heptamers vary [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . To further determine the physiological
          significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX>'s DNA binding, we compared the
          datasets with known endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSs of Ig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> loci.
          The mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR Î±chain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> gene segments (TCRAJ) and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human IgÎ</ENAMEX>º light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgVÎº</ENAMEX>) were analyzed, taking
          advantage of the fact that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> have been sequenced
          and the location and sequence of their RSSs have been
          characterized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgVÎ</ENAMEX>º gene segments
          listed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>) have a nonamer, a heptamer or both
          matching a sequence within the datasets (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).
          Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>) of the TCRAJ RSS elements
          matched one or more sequences in the datasets (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). As controls, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> of random sequences from
          several data sets matched the endogenous RSS sequences
          (data not shown). Potentially, the DNA binding domains of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> might interact with the range of heptamer and nonamer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> found in endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor loci</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> was independently cloned due to its ability to bind
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] motifs. Subsequently,
        sequence analysis identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the ZAS
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which share the ability to bind ÎºB-like
        motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . DNA competition analysis showed that KRC
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C domain bind
        specifically to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and to the ÎºB motif [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 28</NUMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> footprinting analysis further showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to specific nucleotides within the ÎºB and the
        heptamer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In this study, using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding site-selection and amplification
        procedure, we demonstrated that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal ZAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal ZAS-C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are able to bind GT-rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, and confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and ÎºB motifs are
        the high-affinity targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX>.
        In the site-selection experiment, the increasing yield
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in successive rounds of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and purification suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> specifically. Conceivably, repetitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, selection and amplification should have selected
        increasingly specific <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">KRC</ENAMEX> targets as increasingly stringent
        binding conditions were established. As far as we know,
        this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> site-selection study to employ the
        MEME program to identify target consensus sequence. The
        program has been conventionally used to identify conserved
        motifs in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It was chosen as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> motif search
        tool in this study due to its flexibility in recognizing
        several patterns within a set of sequences. It was able to
        identify multiple motifs that could not be recognized by
        other alignment programs, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pileup</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCG Software</ENAMEX>
        Package, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] ) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal W</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] which have been used
        in other site-selection experiments to identify a single
        consensus sequence. The oligonucleotide pool presented in
        this study was composed of a random <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer flanked by
        specific primers. A relatively large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> was used to
        accommodate ligands with a range of potential sizes and
        also to minimize the influence of flanking primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Inspection of the sequence alignments shows that
        all of the KRC-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> align in the (+)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, suggesting that orientation of binding may
        have been influenced by the flanking sequence. However, the
        flanking sequences were constant throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> pool, which should have controlled for
        their relative contribution to consensus sequence.
        Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">input</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> discovered motifs containing
        sequences similar to the ÎºB or Sb transcriptional enhancer
        motifs as well as the conserved heptamer or nonamer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. Generally, the significance of the llr
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>values scores of a motif generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> increased
        with its length whereas the information content per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> position decreased (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>). These are statistical values showing different
        parameters of a motif: llr and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>values reflect the
        likelihood of a motif being generated at random whereas the
        information content represents the degree of conservation.
        In our analysis, passes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> where the width was not set
        to a fixed length but to a given range of nucleotides
        always yielded the longest motif. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> aims at
        generating motifs with the most probable occurrence, and
        the length of a motif may override other parameters in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> is a useful tool with which to discover the
        best motif among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences provided the length is
        specified and determined experimentally.
        Given that the crystal structure of the DNA-protein
        complex revealed that the C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc finger pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTK</ENAMEX>, like the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> zinc fingers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Zif268</NUMEX>, binds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> base-pairs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , we hypothesize that each zinc finger pair of KRC
        may also interact with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> base-pairs. Passes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> for
        pentameric motifs yielded homologous TG-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C datasets: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/G</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGTAT</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TGTGG</ENAMEX>/T for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-C.</ENAMEX> We had
        previously shown by methylation interference analysis that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C bound specifically to the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGTGG</ENAMEX> within
        the context of the canonical RSS heptamer plus the
        immediately flanking guanine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Because the pentamer
        motif for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-C</ENAMEX> predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> completely matched
        with the empirical results, we conclude that the two
        pentameric motifs discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> are likely authentic
        binding sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> as well.
        The putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C domains as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">width</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX>. Specific DNA binding of separate-paired C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc fingers depends on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequences of the finger domains, the linker sequence
        between fingers, and the higher-ordered structure of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of individual C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fingers as determined by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> NMR
        methods has shown that each zinc finger consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal short anti-parallel Î² sheets followed by an Î±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helix</ENAMEX>. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 6</NUMEX>
        of the Î± helix form base contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [Reviewed in [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] ]. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of the zinc finger pairs
        among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are highly conserved [Reviewed in [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] ]. The conservation of the zinc fingers from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invertebrate</ENAMEX> to vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and their common DNA
        binding target sequences suggest that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may
        play similar physiological roles in diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        While the overall sequence identity between human and mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, their corresponding zinc finger pairs are
        completely identical [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). Notably, for those
        critical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> within the Î± helical regions
        of the finger described above, they are identical at all
        corresponding positions between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> zinc
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> except at position 3
        of the first zinc finger (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N; Met</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-C</ENAMEX>) and
        at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> zinc finger (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX>; Gly
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-C</ENAMEX>). Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> are both non-polar amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gly</ENAMEX> are both polar and uncharged amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, those amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitutions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C may result in minor changes in the tertiary structure
        of the zinc fingers which account for the subtle
        differences in the DNA binding properties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C domains. The differences in the linker regions, TGERP
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDVRP</ENAMEX> for ZAS-C, which presumably interact
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-phosphate backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and the
        observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C more readily forms
        higher-ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> may also
        contribute to the differences in the DNA binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-C.</ENAMEX>
        Based on the results here, we hypothesize that each DNA
        binding domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binds to pentameric TG-rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> KRC binding sites when put together can form
        some longer known <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">KRC</ENAMEX> targets. For example a copy of GGTTT
        and its complement can form a sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GG</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-6</ENAMEX> )<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, fulfilling the minimal DNA
        binding requirement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than a lack
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' guanine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, the GT-rich RSS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonamer</ENAMEX> and the palindromic RSS heptamer can serve as
        binding sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> can
        explain why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites but not complete <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">KRC</ENAMEX> targets were
        frequently found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-selected datasets. Although
        previous results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein titration</ENAMEX> experiments suggested
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binds DNA</ENAMEX> in a cooperative manner for a
        given oligonucleotide, the presence of multiple binding
        sites might not be favored over a single site in our site
        selection assay which used a degenerate pool of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> and limited rounds of amplification. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> are
        potentially capable of binding to either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> heptamer or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonamer</ENAMEX>. Because the pentameric motifs derived from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> dataset more closely resemble the canonical RSS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonamer</ENAMEX> and the motif derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C dataset
        more closely resemble the canonical RSS heptamer and a
        canonical sequence was derived from the majority of
        sequences, we propose that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS-N</ENAMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nonamers more frequently than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZAS</ENAMEX>-C domain, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice versa</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> heptamer 
        in vivo .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binds with individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> RSS elements and transcriptional enhancer
        motifs. As the most abundant RSS-binding species detected
        in thymus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] , it is intriguing to propose a role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> in regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination process.
        Several studies have shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> themselves may act
        as 
        cis -acting elements which influence
        recombination frequency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53 54 55 56</NUMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        vary inversely with activation of the catalytic components
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombinase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAG1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAG2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . It is
        possible that differential affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> for individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> influences <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> utilization by the recombinase, allowing
        differential recombination of gene segments.
        Our finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> as well as the ÎºB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> may also provide a link between transcription and
        recombination in the context of the accessibility model [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enhancer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX> are important for
        the recombination process in cell lines and animal models [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, expression of transcription factors, in
        conjunction with the recombination activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, has
        been shown to induce V(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination in non-lymphoid
        tissues by rendering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> accessible to the recombinase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
        ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÎºB motif</ENAMEX>, first found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgÎº</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ]
        , and later in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , has been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promote V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination by modulating locus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessibility</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . In addition to influencing
        recombination by binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> binding of the ÎºB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> may modulate accessibility and transcription of
        target loci. The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX> to promote transcription of
        target genes has been demonstrated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S100/</ENAMEX>mts1 gene
        by binding at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sb</ENAMEX> enhancer motif [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly,
        binding of ÎºB-like motifs by other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ZAS proteins</ENAMEX> has also
        been implicated in transcriptional regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 17</NUMEX> ]
        . Considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC</ENAMEX>'s target sequences, the ÎºB motif and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, the two binding domains on a single KRC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could
        theoretically bring together

          Site selection amplification binding assay was
          performed as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] with modifications. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> binding reaction, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>]-labeled double
          stranded oligonucleotides were generated by first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annealing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSS2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 ng</NUMEX>) to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BSS4</NUMEX> oligonucleotide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ng</ENAMEX>) then end-filling with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î</NUMEX>¼M each of dATP, dGTP, and
          dTTP, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼Ci</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-dCTP and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX>. The oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~500 ng</NUMEX>) was incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS-N</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC/ZAS</ENAMEX>-C
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼g each) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of non-specific competitor DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dI-dC</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were
          resolved on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> polyacryamide gel. After
          autoradiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were isolated from
          the gels and were eluted from the gel slices by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM EDTA
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> were purified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phenol/chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction, followed by alcohol
          precipitation, then were amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using the BSS1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSS2</ENAMEX> primer set. Subsequently, a portion of the DNA
          was labeled with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dCTP</ENAMEX> and used for the next round
          of site-selection. After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round, the stringency
          of each succeeding round of site selection was increased
          by using successively less (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5Ã—</NUMEX>) fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          more (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4Ã—</ENAMEX>) non-specific competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX>-bound
          oligonucleotides from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> round of selection were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> and subcloned into plasmid vectors pCR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of bacteria <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> using a kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). The nucleotide sequences of the inserts
          were determined using automated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing procedures
          performed by the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing Core Facility</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>

          Sequence analysis
          Sequence analysis was performed using the computer
          programs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The data of both programs were processed on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cray</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T3E</ENAMEX> supercomputer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Diego Supercomputer</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sdsc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/meme.</ENAMEX> For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>, the free parameters
          of the analysis were set as the following: (i) the
          occurrences of a single motif distributed among the
          sequences were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> per sequence; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the maximum
          number of motifs to find was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the optimum
          width of each motif ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 25</NUMEX> nucleotides; and
          (iv) both strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were searched. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX>, only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MEME PSSMs</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-value < 1</ENAMEX> were presented, and the
          reverse complement DNA strand was considered with the
          forward orientation in the search.
