        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of chromatin within the eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> has been a subject of great interest as it is
        likely to impact on important processes such as
        recombination [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and epigenetic mechanisms of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Early observations by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabl</ENAMEX> (cited by [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> suggested a preferential polarization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, with their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centromeres</ENAMEX> clustered at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of</TIMEX>
        the nuclear envelope (the apical side) and the telomeres at
        the opposite end (the basal side). More recently, evidence
        from fluorescence 
        in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) studies
        in different systems has suggested that various genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> can be found consistently in specific regions of the
        nucleus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and that subnuclear location can be
        correlated with gene activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Together with results
        from real-time measurements with living cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], these
        studies argue for a structured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        chromosomes.
        The present model we have of chromatin organization
        within the nucleus is a dynamic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, with 'territories' for
        each chromosome defined by their relative location to each
        other [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. During the mitotic cycle, chromosomes are
        duplicated in the S phase and pulled to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
        cells during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase. Chromosome territories are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-established</ENAMEX> after cell division, and once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is
        arrested in a long interphase, chromosome movement becomes
        restricted again [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Some nucleus-to-nucleus variations
        in the exact position of each locus relative to the rest of
        the genome can be expected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. As some random
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> is possible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], there
        is also likely to be time-dependent positional differences
        in the relative coordinates of each locus within a single
        nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. These predicted nucleus-to-nucleus
        variations and the mobility of the established territories
        within the nuclei of various cell types in eukaryotes
        remain poorly defined in most systems.
        So far, most 
        in situ studies of gene positioning
        and changes in higher-order chromatin architecture have
        been carried out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>. This method can produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX>, however, because it requires the fixation and
        permeabilization of cells and denaturation of chromatin
        before hybridization with labeled single-strand probes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. It is also very difficult to perform kinetic studies
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> to track the dynamics of chromatin movement in a
        single nucleus. Recent advances in the application of green
        fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) as an 
        in vivo tag of specific chromosomal
        regions promises to revolutionize our ability to observe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chromatin</ENAMEX>-based processes in near real-time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, first established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Belmont</ENAMEX> and
        collaborators [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], entails the construction of a fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of a
        known heterologous transcription factor. The binding site
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBD</ENAMEX> is multimerized into a concatameric array which
        is then inserted into the genome of animal or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX>.
        Expression of the GFP-DBD fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> results in
        fluorescent tagging of the concatamer 
        in situ . This provides a 'beacon'
        that allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to track the position of this region in the
        genome with high specificity and sensitivity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
        animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, a single concatamer insert can be visualized
        with high resolution and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX>, and the application of
        this technique has provided new insights on chromosome
        behavior [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>].
        These findings might, however, be true only for the few
        cell types and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> strains studied so far, and may not be
        generally applicable to all eukaryotic cells. For example,
        even though chromosome territories showed only small
        movements during an observation period of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>], they may show larger movements over longer time periods
        such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Also, the degree of nuclear order appears to
        depend on the particular cell type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Earlier
        application of this technology in multicellular organisms
        involved extrachromosomal arrays of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> created in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. elegans by</ENAMEX> co-injecting plasmids
        containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> array and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> sequences along with
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were fixed for
        immunological detection and the sizes as well as stability
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> studied remain undefined. Thus, application
        of that technique to study chromatin behavior may be rather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. Very recently, Vazquez 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] applied this technology
        in dissected 
        Drosophila spermatocytes from animals
        that have integrated the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> arrays at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytogenetically</ENAMEX> defined genomic loci. Real-time monitoring
        of chromosome movement in this specialized cell type
        indicated that progression through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G2</TIMEX> dramatically
        restricts the slower, long-range component of chromatin
        movement. This study provided the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> direct evidence for
        cell-cycle control of chromatin movement and elegantly
        illustrated the power of this technology in transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to facilitate the understanding of chromosome
        behavior in a developmental context.
        The model plant 
        Arabidopsis offers an excellent
        system in which to apply this new technology for the study
        of chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and dynamics. Aside from being
        easily transformable and having a well characterized genome
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], it is relatively easy to track cell types and
        individual cells. One can easily distinguish one cell from
        another, and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be tracked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or
        more [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. In the present work, we have successfully
        adapted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">'GFP beacon</ENAMEX>' approach to create the necessary
        tools and transgenic lines for visualizing stably inserted
        concatameric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the genome in live 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and
        technology should open up new opportunities for
        characterizing the physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and movement of
        chromosomes in the nuclei of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> .
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Vector construction and molecular characterization
          of transgenic Arabidopsis
          To control accumulation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> repressor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacI</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuclei</ENAMEX>, a glucocorticoid-inducible gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pTA7002</NUMEX>) was used for vector construction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          A gene encoding a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-optimized GFP variant, 
          mGFP5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], was placed in frame
          with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LacI -SV40</ENAMEX> nuclear localization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> fusion ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and then
          subcloned into the vector pTA7002 under the control of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid receptor</ENAMEX> (GR)-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> near
          the left border. The resulting plasmid is designated as
          pEL700. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other end of the pTA7002</TIMEX> vector, we
          inserted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> copies of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> sequence ( 
          LacOs , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.1 kb</NUMEX>) and designated
          this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> vector pEL702 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The entire plasmid
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pEL702 encompasses about 25 kilobases</NUMEX> (kb) and the
          size of the integrating region flanked by the right and
          left borders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ti</ENAMEX> plasmid is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 17</NUMEX> kb. The
          plasmid was designed such that the DNA between the right
          and left borders can be transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> nuclei via
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Thus, when
          stable transgenic 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are treated with
          the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dex</ENAMEX>), the
          expressed fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> would be able to localize to
          the integrated loci by association with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> . This inducible expression
          system allows controlled expression of a small amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for optimal signal-to-noise and to
          prevent aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the nuclei
          as a result of high protein concentrations. As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belmont</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 25</TIMEX>] reported that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> is unstable in a
          recombination-competent bacterial strain, we are
          concerned with the stability of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in the 
          Agrobacterium strain that is used
          to transform 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> . Thus, we examined the
          stability of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in the 
          Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GV3101/MP90</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis after
          transformation. We found that the 
          LacOs may be unstable in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> initially, as many
          colonies examined turned out to contain truncated arrays
          that are less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1</NUMEX> kb, the size of the original 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pEL702</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We found, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that do show the
          proper size array can be maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2 days</TIMEX>
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">28°C</NUMEX> in liquid culture without a significant reduction
          of the array size (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, we first
          monitored the size of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in our 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> culture before
          transforming 
          Arabidopsis with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> carrying
          full-length or near full-length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> .
          We observed low transformation efficiency of 
          Arabidopsis with 
          Agrobacterium carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pEL702</ENAMEX> under
          our transformation conditions (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of that with
          pEL700, data not shown). We speculate that a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>
          region (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 17 kb</NUMEX>) and/or the presence of a
          large number of tandem repeats of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> region may
          contribute to the low efficiency of gene transfer. After
          we obtained several independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> that grew on
          selection plates containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hygromycin</ENAMEX>, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Southern</ENAMEX>
          blot analysis to determine the size of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> and the relative copy number
          of the inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-DNAs</ENAMEX> in the transformed lines. 
          Pst I digestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from
          the transgenic lines, which should release the
          full-length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.1 kb</NUMEX>) from the integrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-DNA inserts, was hybridized with a probe consisting of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> copies of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> sequence. Thus, in
          this analysis, each fragment should correspond to the
          size of an integrated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> array.
          We detected several bands of different apparent sizes
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), indicating that arrays
          with different numbers of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> sequences were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the genome in each of the lines examined.
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2shows</ENAMEX> data from analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independently
          transformed lines. One line is designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EL702C</ENAMEX> and
          showed hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 9 and 7</TIMEX> kb. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is designated
          EL702E and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from this line showed a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4.5</NUMEX> kb that hybridized with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> probe. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          analysis with homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> from the fifth-generation
          progenies of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> also showed similar signal(s)
          (data not shown). These results indicated that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> could be truncated before or
          during integration into the 
          Arabidopsis genome, but the
          integrated genes were subsequently stable in the plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. For simplicity, we will refer to the integration
          site as a tagged locus.
          The copy numbers of insertions in these lines were
          estimated with restriction digests of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hind III</ENAMEX> in addition to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX>
          analysis using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> fragment as a probe
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Using this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, we should detect
          fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage upstream of the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> sequence in the inserts as
          well as restriction sites present at variable distances
          in the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> neighboring the left border of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX>. Thus, each fragment detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> probably corresponds to a distinct copy of the
          transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that has integrated into the genome.
          Clustered integrations will, however, be more difficult
          to analyze in cases where a large number of insertions
          are present in the particular transgenic line and
          digestions with multiple restriction enzymes will be
          necessary to ascertain the structure of the insertion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>. Our results from digestions with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
          restriction enzymes suggest that there are three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EL702C</ENAMEX> line and a single insertion in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EL702E</ENAMEX> line per haploid genome, consistent with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> obtained with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> probe (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Dexamethasone-inducible expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein</ENAMEX>
          Western blot analysis with anti-GFP polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clonetech</ENAMEX>) was used to test inducibility of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. We analyzed homozygous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">transgenic plants</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EL702C</ENAMEX> and
          EL702E, as well as a line from our control vector,
          EL700S. This latter was transformed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pEL700</TIMEX>, which is
          identical to pEL702 except for the absence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> . As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pEL700</ENAMEX> does not contain
          the 
          LacOs , the transgenic line EL700S
          can be used as a negative control for specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in our experimental system.
          In this line, we expect the accumulation of GFP-LacI/NLS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the nuclei after induction but specific
          binding of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to chromatin should be
          absent. We treated transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">seedlings</ENAMEX> with an excess
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dex</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 μM</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to achieve
          uniform induction. Samples were collected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 6, 12,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 48, 72</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX> after the treatment and proteins
          were extracted in sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX> (SDS)-containing
          buffer for immunological detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          We found that boiling the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> in the
          extraction buffer resulted in loss of all GFP signals on
          our western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX>. This appears to be a result of
          aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insoluble</ENAMEX> materials in plant cells as we do not encounter
          this problem with recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> produced in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we
          omitted the heating step in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sample
          preparation and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-GFP</ENAMEX> cross-reacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be
          readily detected in our assay. Western blot signals were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detected <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> after the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dex</ENAMEX> and
          increased over time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> lines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). After
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, the detection levels did not change
          significantly and comparison between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> lines
          revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dex</ENAMEX>-inducible system in each line
          performed similarly with and without truncated 
          LacOs , and minimal leakiness of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was observed before induction. Although the
          predicted size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kDa,
          we detected several signals between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 to 30</NUMEX> kDa in
          addition to a major species of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 81 kDa</NUMEX> on our blots
          for all lines over time after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. The cause of this
          size heterogeneity of our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP fusion protein</ENAMEX> is unclear
          at present.
        
        
          In situdetection of the tagged loci in transgenic
          plants
          We then examined nucleus labeling by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> after Dex
          treatment in homozygous transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> from lines
          EL702C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> (with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> ), and line EL700S (without 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> ) by fluorescence microscopy.
          Each line was collected at the same time points as for
          the western blot analysis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence was
          observed with appropriate filters. All lines examined
          showed fluorescence in nuclei <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> after the treatment
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, rows A). The intensities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence
          in nuclei were increased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> and stabilized after
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> in all lines. These responses were correlated
          with the results of the western blot analysis. Both
          western blot analysis and microscopy studies confirmed
          that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> does not interfere with
          glucocorticoid-inducible expression.
          To investigate the response of the tagged loci, we
          observed each nucleus with three-dimensional fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>. If the system functions properly, we should
          be able to detect the tagged loci as bright spots above
          the GFP background signals in nuclei of the lines EL702C
          and E, and should not detect any spot in line EL700S
          because of the absence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> . Bright spots were clearly
          observed above the diffused GFP fluorescence in nuclei
          observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h after induction in lines EL702C and E,
          whereas significant fluorescence spots above the diffuse
          background signals were not observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EL700S</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rows B</ENAMEX>). The spots were detected with similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-to-background ratios until the end of the time
          course (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 h</TIMEX> after induction) for lines EL702C and E,
          whereas line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EL700S</NUMEX> did not show any spots during this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course. The study also revealed that an array of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 120</NUMEX> copies of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> sequence is sufficient
          to visualize 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in planta via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, as the
          size of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> in the single inserted locus
          in line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EL702E</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 4.5 kb</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Inhibition of chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding
          in situto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOsby</ENAMEX> IPTG
          To verify if the spots in nuclei correspond to the
          tagged loci, we examined whether the detected subnuclear
          localization of the expressed GFP-LacI/NLS fusion protein
          is sensitive to isopropyl-β<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-D-thiogalactoside</NUMEX> (IPTG). As
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> repressor variant that we used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> sites as dimers, we should be able
          to inhibit its binding to the 
          LacOs of the tagged loci by adding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. If the binding is specific to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacOs</ENAMEX> inserted in the genome, the
          observed fluorescence spots should be suppressed by the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>.
          We used homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> from line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EL702C</NUMEX>, which
          carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> insert, for this
          experiment. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty microliters</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">μM of Dex</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> were dropped on each seedling
          on the culture plates. Guard cells in the stomata of
          cotyledons were observed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> after induction in the
          presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> and the results from observed
          nuclei were tabulated (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>,b). Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>, we
          detected one spot in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spots in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> and three
          spots in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of total observed nuclei ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>) among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> seedlings. With
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>, we detected no spots in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> and one spot in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of
          total observed nuclei ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three seedlings</TIMEX>. We also
          tested protein accumulation levels in the specimens
          examined by western blot analysis. Similar levels of
          signals were detected with and without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>),
          thus indicating that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> repressor binding is inhibited
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> without change in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> accumulation levels.
          This study shows that the observed fluorescence spots in
          lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EL702C</ENAMEX> and E indeed correspond to specific binding
          of the induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the tagged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>. However, the relationship between the spot numbers
          and tagged loci is unclear at this point. For this
          purpose, we are currently determining the precise genomic
          location of the tagged loci and collecting the statistics
          of spot numbers for homozygous and heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> of
          line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EL702C</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detection</ENAMEX> and relational mapping of tagged loci
          configuration
          As <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> contain chloroplasts in leaf and stem cells
          and many autofluorescent compounds are localized in cell
          walls, a signal-to-background ratio for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> detection is
          probably lower than in animal systems. Thus, higher
          levels of accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> may be required to
          detect the loci in our system. Under this condition, we
          found that we could obtain spatial information for
          subnuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with excess unbound GFP-LacI/NLS
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The nuclear contour as well as the shape
          of the nucleolus, for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-LacI/NLS</ENAMEX> has relatively
          low accessibility and which thus appears as an opaque
          object within the nucleus, can be captured along with the
          tagged loci positions by single channel excitation. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guard</ENAMEX>-cell nucleus from homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> of line EL702C
          is shown (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The data can be converted to a
          three-dimensional model shown for the detected spots
          (shown as red objects) and the nucleolus (shown as a blue
          object) within the nucleus (outline shown in green
          wire-frame) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). The distance between the three
          spots can also be easily determined with the existing
          program of our system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison of tagged loci between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> cells and
          root epidermal cells
          Plant organs are composed of ordered collections of
          various cell types that differ in their shape, size,
          function and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content. The positive correlation
          observed in most cells between cell volume and the degree
          of polyploidy indicates that the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content may
          have a key role in controlling cell growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. In 
          Arabidopsis , the ploidy level
          varies from 2C (guard cells, sepal and petal epidermal
          cells) to 64C (leaf trichomes) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. However, the
          mechanism of endocycle control in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> remains poorly
          understood. As an application of our chromatin-tagging
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, we show here that cell-specific polyploidy can be
          observed directly with this technology without measuring
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content.
          We used the homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> of line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EL702E</NUMEX>, which
          contain a single tagged locus, for this experiment. GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signals</ENAMEX> observed in a cotyledon guard cell (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>)
          and an elongated root epidermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>) of a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-day-old seedling</ENAMEX> were compared using three-dimensional
          projections of their nuclei after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dex</ENAMEX> induction. In the
          guard cell, where the shape of its nucleus is usually
          flat or spherical, we often detected one spot, which
          suggests that the tagged site is frequently paired with
          its homolog. In contrast, in the elongated root epidermal
          cells where the nucleus usually elongates at the two
          opposite sides, we often detected multiple fluorescence
          spots (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> spots for the root nucleus shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), which indicates the polyploid nature of the observed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX>. Upon further refinement of this technology, one
          may be able to study the dynamics and regulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoreduplication</ENAMEX> in plant cells that contribute to
          cell-specific ploidy differences.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have established transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that enable us to
        observe specific tagged genomic loci together with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nucleolar</ENAMEX> location in cells of a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> without any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX>. Using this system, we have visualized GFP-tagged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> in different cell types in living 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. GFP-tagged
        chromosome observation has been applied in several studies
        involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, cultured animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and, more recently,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> 
        Drosophila spermatocytes. These
        studies have revealed new principles of chromosome dynamics
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. However, the relationship between
        chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and cell types and developmental stages
        is an important question that remains unanswered. The
        intact 
        Arabidopsis seedlings that were used
        for microscopy under our conditions remain viable after
        transplanting to soil from the slides. Thus, it should be
        possible to monitor the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> continuously for up to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>. In future, by marking individual cells with
        visual tags it should be possible to follow changes in
        nuclear shape as well as relative subnuclear position of
        the nucleolus and specific tagged genomic loci over long
        times-scales of the order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. These types of studies
        may reveal new aspects of chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in
        relationship to developmental timing.
