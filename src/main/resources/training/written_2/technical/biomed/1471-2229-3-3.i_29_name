        Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats
        or SSRs, are a small array of tandemly arranged bases (one
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>) spread throughout the genomes. Microsatellites as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX> are advantageous over many other markers as
        they are highly polymorphic, highly abundant, co-dominant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inheritance</ENAMEX>, analytical simple and readily transferable [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . Microsatellites are reported to be more variable than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLPs</ENAMEX> or RAPDs, and have been widely utilized in plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . The advantages of
        microsatellite over other types of genetic markers will
        become more important, and more obvious, when they are used
        to track desirable traits in large-scale breeding programs
        and as anchor points for map-based gene cloning strategies
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        There are a number of ways to obtain microsatellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. Screening genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> by hybridizing with
        SSR probes and sequencing the hybridized positive clones is
        traditional but a laborious and costly approach. While
        screening the SSR-enriched, small-insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> can
        significantly reduce time and cost [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Enrichment can
        be realized by hybridizing SSR-containing fragments with
        biotin-labeled probes that are either captured by magnetic
        beads coated with streptavidin or fixed on a nitrate filter
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The eluted portion after removing non-hybridized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was highly enriched for microsatellites, with
        enrichment efficiency <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 50-90%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> or groundnut ( 
        Arachis hypogaea <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>) is an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> for oil and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
        are the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, it is grown throughout the
        world. Despite the existence of substantial diversity among
        cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut genotypes</ENAMEX> for various morphological,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and agronomic traits, very little DNA
        variations had been detected by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Because of the lack of
        polymorphism at DNA level, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this crop</TIMEX> has lagged behind in
        genetic mapping, marker-assisted selection, resistance gene
        cloning, and crop evolutionary study compared with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>. This problem has hindered the improvement of
        cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> by molecular techniques. Although
        microsatellites present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] ,
        microsatellites have not been fully identified, developed
        or utilized, and detailed information on the abundance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX> still remains blank.
        The objectives of this study were: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to identify
        microsatellites from the cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut genome</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        to detect the polymorphisms using these novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX> in a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut accessions</ENAMEX> with
        diversified origins.
      
      
        Results
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microsatellite-enriched libraries</ENAMEX> were constructed
        using the enrichment procedure with some modification. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were randomly picked from primary
        transformation plates and sequenced. The length of most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inserts</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 100 bp - 300 bp</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 247</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>) of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were found to contain SSR sequences, of which most
        were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GA/CT</ENAMEX> repeats. Among these SSR-containing fragments,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> were unique (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) while the rest were redundant (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>).
        We could design primer pairs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>). The remaining sequences
        had too short flanking region to design primers. From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> could detect a polymorphism among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peanut genotypes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The average number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles per locus</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</NUMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Because the
        highest number of alleles was found using primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PM50</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> more genotypes including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genotype from a wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> ( 
        A. monticola ) were used to search
        more alleles at this particular locus. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 14</NUMEX> alleles
        were identified at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PM50</NUMEX> locus when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> genotypes were
        surveyed (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that such a
        large number of alleles were identified in cultivated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peanut</ENAMEX>. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> such highly polymorphic markers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genotypes</ENAMEX> could be differentiated (data not
        showed). We believe that microsatellite markers in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>
        might be abundant like other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">legume species</ENAMEX>, such as
        soybean. These primary results suggest that this system is
        a promising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for isolation and characterization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>.

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peanut</ENAMEX> is a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> because very little genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> has been detected by molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLPs</ENAMEX>, isozymes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAPDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Only a few molecular
        markers have been identified to link with resistance genes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] and thus genetic improvement through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> assisted breeding is limited. Although a
        considerable number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> have been identified [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] , substantially more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX> are needed to
        saturate the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut linkage map</ENAMEX> and to initiate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> studies for this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species.
        Microsatellites have become one of the most widely used
        molecular markers for genetic studies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>.
        Enriching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> or specific adaptor-amplified DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> is a simple and efficient approach for SSR
        isolation and has been successfully applied to a number of
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . By employing the
        modified procedures from other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species, corresponding
        isolating protocols were established in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> for
        development of microsatellites through this study. When the
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was converted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> fragment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, the
        different set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> fragments could be amplified using
        selective primers and then used for hybridizing with SSR
        probes. By optimizing the hybridization and washing steps,
        most of the AFLP fragments were found to harbor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX> after cloning and sequencing. In order to
        enrich SSR-containing fragments efficiently, several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 28 33</NUMEX> ] combined several SSR probes to
        hybridize with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments. However, some types of repeat
        were lost due to improper temperature during hybridization
        followed by washing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The probes were separately
        hybridized with fragments to prevent some probes from
        washing out in this study. However, the fragments
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing GA/CT</ENAMEX> repeats were found most using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> probes
        separately. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GT</ENAMEX>/CA or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT/TA</ENAMEX> repeats were identified in
        some fragments. The results indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GA/CT</ENAMEX> repeats
        are the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microsatellites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut genome</ENAMEX>.
        Compared to the previous report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopkins et al.</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut microsatellites</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> polymorphic
        markers from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 primer</NUMEX> pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>) were identified using
        library screening method, our enrichment procedure was more
        efficient in identifying SSR markers, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>) showed a polymorphism. Although the percentage
        of detection of SSR markers based on total number of clones
        used was almost same, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5/120</ENAMEX> clones) from previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">19/401</ENAMEX> clones) from our results, the
        enrichment procedure is faster and less cost than library
        screening.
        The rate of redundancy was high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>, while it was
        very low in cotton [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . It decreased the efficacy of
        development of microsatellites in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a
        bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is needed to identify more microsatellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libraries</ENAMEX> could be constructed by hybridization of
        SSR probes with different set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> fragments resulted
        from changing different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-base at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> primers,
        which should have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer</ENAMEX> combinations, or with
        different set of restriction fragments resulted from using
        different restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> combinations.
        No correlation was found in cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> between
        the number of repeat and the informativeness of the SSR,
        although a positive correlation has been reported for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grapevine</ENAMEX> and tomato [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The locus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PM50</ENAMEX> contains only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nineteen GA</ENAMEX> motifs but is highly polymorphic. Other loci,
        e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM244</ENAMEX> [(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX>) 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> ], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM209</ENAMEX> [(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX>) 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> ] harbor much more uniform repeat
        units, but showed no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> variations among diversified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX> studied. No polymorphism was detected with
        the repeat number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX>.
        With high-throughput technologies and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, such
        as robotic, imaging, and computational sequencing and
        genotyping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, more reliable polymorphic markers
        will be used to construct a high resolution genetic map and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>-assisted selection or even map-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cloning</ENAMEX> will be
        realized before long in cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results provided by the present study highlight a
        simple and reliable way in obtaining polymorphic
        microsatellite markers from the cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>. A
        significance of the results is that development of
        microsatellite markers is important not only for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> but also for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> industry as the paucity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX> in cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut</ENAMEX> has so far precluded
        detailed genetic research on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this crop</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        Peanut plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using MasterPure

        ligated with corresponding adapters and then amplified
        using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-base selective primers (

        added to a single reaction mixture containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.2 ×</NUMEX> SSC
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saline-Sodium Citrate</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.07%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> (sodium dodecyl

        incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> and chilled quickly on ice
        for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX>. It was then kept at proper temperature
        (depending on the melting temperature of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> to perform annealing, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (GT)

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptavidin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 μg/μl</ENAMEX>) was prepared by gently shaking the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slurry</ENAMEX> was transferred to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> ml tube, then washed 4

        at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> with constant gentle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agitation</ENAMEX>. After immobilization, the supernatant was
        removed by applying a magnetic field to precipitate the
        beads, which attached the SSR containing fragments that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bead-probe</ENAMEX>-fragment
        complex was washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times each for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
        μl non-stringency washing buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TE</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCl</ENAMEX>) at
        room temperature. The complex was further washed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
        μl stringency buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times
        each for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature. After the final
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">wash</ENAMEX>, the washing buffer was completely removed, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 μl</NUMEX> of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www-genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mit</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.</ENAMEX>cgiand
        were synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma-Genosys</ENAMEX>. SSR primers were used to
        amplify the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNAs</ENAMEX> extracted from a panel of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peanut accessions</ENAMEX> with diversified origins (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        The PCR programs for most primer pairs were as follows:
        94°C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> min for initial denaturation; 94°C<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/30 sec</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> to
        56°C<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/30 sec</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72°C/1</NUMEX> min, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> at each annealing
        temperature; 94°C<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/15 sec</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55°C/30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72°C/1</NUMEX> min for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        cycles; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72°C/10</NUMEX> min final extension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . For some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM36</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, PM45</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM50</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM53</TIMEX>, and
        PM60, the PCR conditions should be optimized to find
        suitable annealing temperature, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of
        94°C<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/30 sec</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60°C/1</NUMEX> min or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50°C/1</NUMEX> min, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72°C/1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were separated on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>
        denaturing polyacrylamide gels for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> voltages
        and visualized by silver staining.
