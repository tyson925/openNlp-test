        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfasalazine</ENAMEX> (SSZ) is a widely used and highly
        effective anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> and ulcerative colitis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> is
        also being used with increasing frequency in the treatment
        of various rheumatolgical disorders [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> is
        preferred over other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and penicillamine
        in rheumatology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> due to its more favorable side
        effect profile [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Nonetheless, rash, fever, and
        dyspepsia occur in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3% to 20%</NUMEX> of treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . These reactions are usually dose dependent and improve
        with dose reduction or discontinuation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 12</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        more serious but less common side effects have also been
        reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . We now report a severe
        systemic reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> with
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> characterized by granulomatous
        infiltration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>, colon and small bowel as
        well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholestatic hepatitis</ENAMEX> and seizures.
      
      
        Case Report
        A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year old</TIMEX> female was diagnosed with polyarticular
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> and was managed with naprosyn
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naproxen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nutley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 years</TIMEX>.
        Joint inflammation was well controlled with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxychlorquine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaquenil, Sanofi Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">York, NY</ENAMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> thru <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2000</TIMEX> when
        hydroxychlorquine was discontinued due to persistent anemia
        and a flare in her <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> despite adequate therapy. The
        patient was started on iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplementation</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-week</ENAMEX>
        course of low dose prednisone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June/ July 2000</TIMEX>. Due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">persistent arthritis</ENAMEX>, sulfasalazine was initiated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 2000</TIMEX> at a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, increasing to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> mg twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liver biochemistries</ENAMEX> were normal
        immediately before and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after initiating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three weeks</TIMEX> after starting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed an
        erythematous rash over the upper extremities and trunk that
        improved with cetirizine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zyrtec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>). She then developed fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
        and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> sweats which lead to hospitalization on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8/29/00</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> was discontinued. At presentation, serum alkaline
        phosphatase was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">923</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IU/L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">105 IU/L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">143 IU/L</ENAMEX>,
        bilirubin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.6</NUMEX> k/l with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosinophils</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next six days</TIMEX>, she gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pounds
        in fluid weight and had fevers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">103°F</TIMEX> despite broad
        spectrum antibiotics. She was transferred on hospital day #
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan Medical Center</ENAMEX> for further
        evaluation and management.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> reported a prior history of infectious
        mononucleosis at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX> and was a non-smoker and consumed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol infrequently</ENAMEX>. She denied any known drug allergies
        or prior exposure to sulfa containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>. There was no family history of allergy to
        sulfa products.
        On hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#6</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> appeared toxic with a
        temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">102°F</TIMEX>, pulse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">154/min</TIMEX>, and blood pressure of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100/58</NUMEX>. Scleral icterus was present as well as deeply
        jaundiced, edematous skin with a macular, erythematous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX>. Non-tender, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-2</ENAMEX> cm lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> were palpated in the
        neck, axilla, and groin. There were decreased breath sounds
        with mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bibasilar rales</ENAMEX> and a hyperdynamic precordium.
        The abdomen was diffusely tender and distended. Rectal
        examination revealed brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hemoccult</ENAMEX> + stool. Neurologic
        examination was unremarkable.
        Laboratory studies revealed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44.2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6/L
        with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> bands, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> neutrophils, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> lymphocytes, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
        monocytes, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> eosinophils. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> and absolute
        neutrophil count nadired on hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 19</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemoglobin</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX>, platelets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336,000</NUMEX>, reticulocyte
        count <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX> and serum ferritin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ ml. The serum alkaline
        phosphatase was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1002</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IU/L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST 57 IU/L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">76 IU/L</ENAMEX>, total
        bilirubin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl, albumin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>, total protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> g/dl
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">INR 1.5</NUMEX>. Serum fibrinogen was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl and d-dimer
        levels were elevated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mcg</ENAMEX>/ ml. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hepatitis A</ENAMEX>, B,
        and C serologies and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANCA</ENAMEX> were negative. CT scan of
        the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bilateral pleural
        effusions, splenomegaly, and axillary, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">para-aortic</ENAMEX>, and
        inguinal lymphadenopathy. Stool 
        Clostridium difficile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> B was
        negative. Because of her persistent diarrhea,
        hypoalbuminemia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, an upper endoscopy and
        flexible sigmoidoscopy were performed on hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 8</NUMEX>
        to exclude a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> losing enteropathy. Although both
        studies were endoscopically normal, histopathology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> mucosal biopsies revealed characteristic features of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> with granulomas in the colon and erosive
        duodenitis with a single granuloma in the small bowel
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Anti-gliadin and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-endomysial</ENAMEX> antibodies
        were negative. On hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 9</NUMEX>, a bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> biopsy
        revealed marked eosinophilia and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>, non-caseating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granulomas</ENAMEX>. Flow cytometry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> and
        peripheral blood revealed no evidence of malignancy. AFB
        and fungal stains of the gastrointestinal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
        biopsies were negative as were cultures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks later</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPD</ENAMEX> and candida control were both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-reactive.</ENAMEX>
        Given the suspicion of a systemic drug reaction as the
        etiology of her illness, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was given high dose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous steroids</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> starting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 14</NUMEX> followed by a prednisone taper. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a rapid improvement of her diarrheal
        symptoms followed by resolution of her peripheral edema and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphadenopathy</ENAMEX>. There were also concomitant improvements
        in her hematological and liver profiles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed generalized absence
        seizures on hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#20</NUMEX>. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis
        revealed an isolated increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> with a normal
        protein level. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium contrast
        identified patchy and irregular signal enhancement in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> matter of the occipital poles, frontoparietal regions,
        and cerebellar hemispheres. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was started on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenytoin</ENAMEX> and later changed to oxcarbazepine. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> month
        post-discharge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was markedly improved as her
        steroid dose was tapered. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> post-discharge, a
        repeat upper and lower endoscopy with terminal ileum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intubation</ENAMEX> and random biopsies were normal. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> months
        after presentation off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had completely
        recovered with no evidence of residual hematological,
        gastrointestinal, or neurological sequelae.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfasalazine</ENAMEX> is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent
        in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> and ulcerative colitis
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Recent data has demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> is also
        safe and effective in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>
        and other rheumatological disorders [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Sulfasalazine
        is a dimer composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-aminosalicylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> linked by an
        azo bond to sulfapyridine. The anti-inflammatory activity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> is due to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-aminosalicylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> component while
        the majority of the adverse side effects have been
        attributed to the sulfapyridine moiety [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fever</ENAMEX>, abdominal pain, and rash may develop in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3% to 20%</NUMEX> of
        treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but these side effects are usually mild
        and improve with dose reduction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . Severe side
        effects necessitating SSZ discontinuation occur in less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed a severe systemic illness
        following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> therapy for rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. In retrospect, her clinical presentation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX>, fever, and lymphadenopathy within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> of
        initiating treatment is consistent with severe SSZ toxicity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, in this case and others, it can be
        difficult to distinguish a severe drug reaction from other
        disease processes such as infection and malignancy. In our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s case, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of lymphoma was raised in light
        of her underlying rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> as well as prominent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphadenopathy</ENAMEX> and splenomegaly. In addition, a possible
        opportunistic fungal, mycobacterial, or other atypical
        infection was raised with the high fevers, low grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DIC</ENAMEX>,
        and disseminated granulomas that persisted after SSZ
        discontinuation. Lastly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> or ulcerative
        colitis with extraintestinal manifestations was a
        possibility with her severe iron <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency anemia</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, and granulomatous enteritis. It was only after
        extensive evaluation that a preliminary diagnosis of SSZ
        drug toxicity was made. Occult inflammatory bowel disease
        was not definitively excluded until follow-up endoscopy was
        repeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months later</TIMEX>.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s clinical presentation with multi-organ
        involvement due to an immunoallergic reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> has
        not been previously reported. The gastrointestinal mucosal
        biopsies in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> demonstrated multiple
        non-caseating granulomas with prominent eosinophilia
        suggestive of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In addition, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow biopsy</ENAMEX> also demonstrated multiple
        non-caseating granulomas and eosinophilia. Although other
        systemic illnesses such as untreated tuberculosis, Q fever,
        fungal infections, and lymphoma can lead to
        gastrointestinal granuloma, the acute nature of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s symptoms and rapid improvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> make
        these causes unlikely. Furthermore, special stains and
        studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s tissues revealed no evidence of
        malignancy or infection. To our knowledge, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> other
        case of a systemic granulomatous reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> has been
        reported which improved within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of SSZ
        discontinuation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In other cases of granulomatous
        drug reactions, multi-organ involvement with fevers and
        eosinophilia have been reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had severe cholestatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coagulopathy</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Still's disease</ENAMEX> can rarely lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">hepatic</ENAMEX> involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholestatic hepatitis</ENAMEX>, the prior
        history of rheumatoid factor seropositivity and a low serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferritin</ENAMEX> level made this diagnosis unlikely [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Granulomatous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> with marked elevations in serum
        alkaline phosphatase and granulomas on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver biopsy</ENAMEX> have
        been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hepatotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . Although liver tissue was not obtained in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the predominance of serum alkaline phosphatase and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilirubin</ENAMEX> level elevations and the presence of granulomas
        in other tissues suggest that she probably had
        granulomatous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>. The presumed mechanism of liver
        injury in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> hepatotoxicity is an idiosyncratic
        hypersensitivity response. Both severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> and acute
        liver failure have been attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> hepatotoxicity demonstrate a prompt
        recurrence of symptoms upon rechallenge with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfonamide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susceptibility</ENAMEX> to the toxic
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> and other sulfonamides may be due to the
        interaction of metabolic pathways regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-acetylation
        and specific detoxification of the metabolites of the drug
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . However, it remains unclear if genetic
        differences in drug metabolizing enzyme expression may
        increase the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> toxicity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myelotoxicity</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was manifest by leukopenia
        and neutropenia (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> has previously been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with neutropenia with an estimated incidence of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.04%</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 30 days</TIMEX> of treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow biopsy</ENAMEX> specimens of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agranulocytosis</ENAMEX> reveal a paucity of myeloid cells but full
        recovery typically occurs within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> of drug
        discontinuation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . Although our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
        adequate myeloid cells in her bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow biopsy</ENAMEX>, she
        developed absolute neutropenia by hospital day <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#19</NUMEX> that
        improved with steroid therapy. SSZ induced agranulocytosis
        is believed to be mediated by immunological
        hypersensitivity of myeloid precursors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Spontaneous
        recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> agranulocytosis is frequently seen,
        although fatalities have been reported and some patients
        may benefit from granulocyte macrophage-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> stimulating
        factor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] .
        A final clinical feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> toxicity in our patient
        was the development of seizures. Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
        no known risk factors, the onset of seizures began in
        combination with other clinical manifestations of SSZ
        toxicity. Interestingly, the MRI demonstrated diffuse gray
        matter abnormalities. Although central nervous system
        vasculitis due to immune complex deposition or drug-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lupus</ENAMEX> is a possible etiology of seizures in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
        there was no evidence of immune complex deposition
        elsewhere. Another possibility is that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may
        have developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CNS</ENAMEX> granulomas. Seizures have previously
        been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX>, often in the
        setting of other clinical manifestations of toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] . Although a brain biopsy would be needed to prove
        our hypotheses, there is a precedent for other systemic
        granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis leading to CNS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granuloma</ENAMEX> formation and seizures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . Fortunately,
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has remained stable with no evidence of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progressive</ENAMEX> neurological disorder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> after
        presentation.
        Treatment of severe adverse drug reactions is primarily
        supportive once a diagnosis has been established and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">offending</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> has been discontinued. However, in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s case with her prominent features of a
        hypersensitivity reaction and failure to improve after SSZ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discontinuation</ENAMEX>, corticosteroids were administered to
        hasten recovery. Fortunately, most of her clinical symptoms
        promptly improved after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> were begun. The use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> in the setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> toxicity is controversial
        and not always effective. In cases of fulminant hepatic
        failure and agranulocytosis, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have died
        despite the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 37</NUMEX> ] . Intravenous
        immunoglobulin was reported as a successful "rescue"
        therapy in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> induced fulminant hepatic
        failure and erythroid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypoplasia</ENAMEX> who had not responded to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Due to the infrequent occurrence of
        severe SSZ toxicity that does not improve with drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discontinuation</ENAMEX>, it is unlikely that randomized controlled
        trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> or other interventions will be
        performed. It appears reasonable to reserve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe systemic SSZ toxicity that fail to
        respond to supportive care following drug
        discontinuation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfasalazine</ENAMEX> is a commonly used and effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease
        and various rheumatologic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. Side effects usually
        develop within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> of treatment and are frequently
        managed with dose adjustments. However, there is a subset
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may develop severe and unusual systemic
        side effects. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be at
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> toxicity compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        there are no reliable laboratory or clinical predictors of
        SSZ toxicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, practicing physicians
        should be aware of the potential for severe, unexplained
        granulomatous reactions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> that can mimic other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infectious</ENAMEX>, malignant, and autoimmune conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fever,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX>, and eosinophilia developing within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">initiating SSZ</ENAMEX> should alert the clinician to the
        possibility of a drug reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> toxicity
        should avoid exposure to all sulfonamide containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
        due to potential cross-reactivity. In addition, some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory bowel disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have demonstrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASA</ENAMEX> products [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . If severe
        symptoms do not resolve with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSZ</ENAMEX> discontinuation, a short
        course of corticosteroids may be of benefit.
