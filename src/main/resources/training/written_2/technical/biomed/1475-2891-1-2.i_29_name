        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> is an essential nutrient, the main lipid
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antioxidant</ENAMEX>, and plays a significant role in
        protecting biological membranes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> from
        damage caused by free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> generated during lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Recent information suggests that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> also has functions unrelated to its role as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidant</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> is often equated only with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol since this form is the most potent in
        protecting the fetuses of pregnant female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> from death
        and resorption. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> is, however, not a single
        compound and refers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> tocopherols (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-,</ENAMEX>
        beta-, delta- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tocotrienols
        (alpha-, beta-, delta- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocotrienol</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major forms of vitamin E found in human plasma and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. Under 
        in vitro conditions, alpha- and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> have very similar abilities to inhibit
        lipid peroxidation in large unilamellar liposomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        The dietary intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        times that of alpha-tocopherol in Western diets. The levels
        of alpha-tocopherol in human plasma are, nevertheless,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> times higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>.
        Both alpha- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> are absorbed from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intestine</ENAMEX> and secreted into chylomicrons equally well [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        ] . The selective retention of alpha-tocopherol in plasma
        is attributed to a number of factors such as the hepatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (alpha-TTP), which
        preferentially incorporates alpha-tocopherol (over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>) into very low density lipoprotein [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, the affinity of the different forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> for the alpha-TTP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> appears to be a primary
        determinant of their plasma levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In addition,
        there is evidence suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> is
        preferentially catabolized to a water-soluble form (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,7</NUMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-trimethyl-2-</TIMEX>(beta-carboxyethyl)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-hydroxychroman or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gamma-CEHC</ENAMEX>) by side chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxidation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        It is also possible that a more rapid cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (and removal from plasma) could contribute
        to the preferential maintenance of alpha-tocopherol in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX>. A more rapid cellular accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (compared to alpha-tocopherol) would also
        have major physiological consequences. The protection of
        subcellular organelles and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from free radical
        damage is likely to be primarily dependent upon
        intracellular vitamin E levels as opposed to plasma vitamin
        E levels. Surprisingly, there have been very few studies
        comparing the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptakes</ENAMEX> of alpha- and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopherol.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] found a
        preferentially uptake (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fold higher after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>
        of incubation) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol in cultured human umbilical endothelial
        cells. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] found a similar
        incorporation of both alpha- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> into
        RAW264<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> macrophages and only a slightly higher (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>)
        incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> endothelial cells.
        In this investigation, we studied the uptake and
        depletion of alpha-tocopherol and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> as well
        as their quinone oxidation products (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) by
        RAW264<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> murine macrophages. There are no previous studies
        on the cellular uptake tocopheryl quinones. We found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> was taken up more rapidly and accumulated
        to higher levels than alpha-tocopherol in RAW264.7
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. In addition, we found that presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> dramatically increased the cellular uptake
        of alpha-tocopherol. We also describe a novel high pressure
        liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneously
        separating and quantifying levels of alpha-tocopherol,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone.

          medium not containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tocopherols</ENAMEX> and depletion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tocopherols</ENAMEX> followed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> of incubating macrophages with either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>), the intracellular
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least six</NUMEX> fold higher
          than the levels of alpha-tocopherol (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). A
          major goal of this research was to determine if
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol interacted with
          each other so as influence their uptake and depletion.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Bshows</NUMEX> the uptake and depletion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> when both were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> together with macrophages. It is clear (compare
          Figure 3Ato <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3B</ENAMEX>) that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          considerably enhanced the uptake of alpha-tocopherol (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). The presence of alpha-tocopherol did not,
          however, markedly enhance the uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>.
          After washing with fresh medium without tocopherols, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophage</ENAMEX> levels of both alpha-tocopherol and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> decreased, but the depletion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> was always faster than that of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-tocopherol.</ENAMEX>
          The changes in tocopherol levels (expressed as
          nmoles/well) in the medium were also measured during both
          the uptake and depletion phases and these data are
          provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tables 1</ENAMEX>(for alpha-tocopherol or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(for alpha-tocopherol plus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>). In order to make meaningful
          comparison, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2also</ENAMEX> provide the cell content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tocopherols</ENAMEX> expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nmoles</ENAMEX>/well. The data in Tables
          1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2indicate</TIMEX> that only a small percentage of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tocopherols</ENAMEX> lost from the medium during the uptake phase
          are recovered in the macrophages. This suggests that a
          considerable amount of tocopherol is lost during
          incubation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catabolism</ENAMEX>/oxidation. The recovery of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol during the uptake phase was, however,
          greater when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> was present.
          It is interesting that the depletion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol from the medium during the uptake phase
          was always greater than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> yet the
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> was always greater
          than that of alpha-tocopherol. Tables 1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2also</TIMEX> indicate
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol decreases</ENAMEX> from RAW264<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> macrophages
          more rapidly than alpha-tocopherol during the depletion
          phase.
          Tocopheryl quinones (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) are likely products
          formed by the oxidation of tocopherols. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the
          initial distribution of alpha-tocopherol or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and their quinone products both in the
          medium and in cells as well as the distribution after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          hr of incubation in the cell system. These data show that
          the nmoles of tocopherol that accumulated in cells after
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> hr is very small compared to the amount in the medium.
          For the data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, for example, the original amount
          of alpha-tocopherol in the medium was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmole</ENAMEX>/well,
          but the amount present in cells after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> hr was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>
          nmole/well, i.e., less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> of the original amount
          in the medium. The original amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmole</ENAMEX>/well, and the amount present in cells
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> hr was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmole</ENAMEX>/well, which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8%</NUMEX> of the
          original amount in the medium.
          If tocopheryl quinones were the only
          catabolic/oxidation products formed during incubation
          with the macrophages, then the nmoles of tocopherol plus
          the nmoles of tocopheryl quinone in the medium and in the
          cells should be constant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3clearly</ENAMEX> shows that the
          sum of the tocopherol and its quinone product decreased
          over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> hr experiment suggesting that products, other
          than the tocopheryl quinone, were formed during the
          experiment. Moreover, these data show that after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hr of</TIMEX>
          incubation: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) cellular alpha-tocopheryl quinone levels
          were generally higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cellular tocopheryl quinones levels were
          always much lower than cellular tocopherol levels. This
          latter point suggests that the low cellular levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> levels)
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, as compared to Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, cannot be
          explained by the simple cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxidation</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol to alpha-tocopheryl quinone (with no
          further catabolism or oxidation). After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hr</TIMEX>, macrophages
          incubated with both alpha- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 0.5 nmole</NUMEX> more alpha-tocopherol than
          did macrophages incubated with alpha-tocopherol alone.
          If, in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> nmole of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol were converted to alpha-tocopheryl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX> (and no further catabolism occurred) than this
          should be recovered in cells. The data in Table
          3indicate, however, a cellular accumulation of only about
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.03 nmoles</NUMEX> of alpha-tocopheryl quinone. Moreover,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> actually had a lower content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone when incubated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> alone then when incubated with both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> together. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol promotes the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX>, it clearly did not do so by
          dramatically protecting alpha-tocopherol from oxidation
          to alpha-tocopheryl quinone (with no further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">catabolism/oxidation</ENAMEX> of alpha-tocopheryl quinone).
        
        
          The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones
          (separately and together)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAW 264.7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 Î</NUMEX>¼M

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX> alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>) or with both together (Figure
          4Bwith <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> Î¼M alpha-tocopheryl quinone and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX>) and the uptake and depletion
          measured as described above. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4indicates</TIMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone accumulates to higher levels
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX> (e.g. at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> the
          difference is significant at p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Similarly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone was lost from the cells more
          rapidly during the depletion phase. These results are
          consistent with those in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, which always indicate a
          higher intracellular concentration of alpha-tocopheryl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> the initial distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone in
          both the medium and cells and the distribution after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> hr
          of incubation with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quinone</ENAMEX> separately or both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinones</ENAMEX> together. Only a very small fraction of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone lost from the medium was taken
          up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAW264.7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX>, i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone was incubated by alone and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX>
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopheryl</ENAMEX> was incubated along with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone. In the case of alpha-tocopheryl
          quinone there was substantially greater recovery, i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> when alpha-tocopheryl alone was incubated with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> when alpha-tocopheryl quinone was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX>. The data
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 4clearly show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidized</ENAMEX> and/or catabolized more rapidly than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone. The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 4also
          indicate that cellular quinone uptake of was not
          influence by an interaction between alpha- and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinones.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The uptake and depletion of tocopherols (separately
          and together)
          Our results consistently show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          was taken up more rapidly and accumulated to higher
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> levels than alpha-tocopherol. Moreover, the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol markedly promoted the uptake
          of alpha-tocopherol by macrophages. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> were
          incubated with alpha-tocopherol or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">individually</ENAMEX>, the macrophage level of alpha-tocopherol
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 10-20%</NUMEX> of that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>).
          In marked contrast, when macrophages were incubated with
          both alpha- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherols</ENAMEX> together the cellular
          level of alpha-tocopherol were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70-80%</NUMEX> (after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hr</TIMEX>) that
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). There were no marked
          changes in the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> caused by the
          presence of alpha-tocopherol.
          Tocopherol quinones were considered to be likely
          oxidization products of the tocopherols. The increased
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of alpha-tocopherol caused by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> could be caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
          protecting alpha-tocopherol from 
          in vitro oxidation to its quinone
          form. However, the data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3show</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> does not slow the oxidation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopherol to alpha-tocopheryl quinone. In the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX>, the cellular levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl quinone were even higher than in its
          absence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). It is possible, however, that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> may protect alpha-tocopherol from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catabolism</ENAMEX> (or 
          in vitro oxidation) into products
          other than quinones. The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3certainly</ENAMEX> suggest
          that products, other than quinones, were produced when
          the macrophages were incubated with tocopherols. Those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolites</ENAMEX> could very possibly be water-soluble
          products, such as alpha-CEHC or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-CEHC</ENAMEX> that were not
          measured in this investigation.
          It is not clear why our result differ from those
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] who also measured
          the uptake of alpha- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> separately in
          RAW264<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> macrophages (but not both together). Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> is depleted from macrophages more
          rapidly than alpha-tocopherol the time interval between
          removal of the tocopherol enriched medium and cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harvesting</ENAMEX> could be an important variable. Our results
          are, however, qualitatively very similar to those
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] for human endothelial
          cells although these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> did not directly
          compare the results from incubating cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> separately or
          together.
        
        
          The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones
          (separately and together)
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> were incubated tocopheryl quinones
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), the cellular levels of alpha-tocopheryl
          quinone were always found to be higher than that of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX> (independent of the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopheryl quinone</ENAMEX>). The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 4suggest
          that alpha-tocopheryl quinone is fairly stable in the
          cell incubation system compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopheryl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Physiological significance of the results
          It is not known if the 
          in vitro results of this study are
          relevant to the 
          in vivo conditions. It is
          interesting, however, that in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model, graded
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dietary gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> in a diet containing a
          constant level of alpha-tocopherol were found to increase
          the levels of alpha-tocopherol in serum and most tissues
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This remarkable result has yet to be reproduced
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> but certainly suggests an interaction between
          dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> and alpha-tocopherol similar to
          that reported here on the cellular level. The potential
          health related significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> is being
          increasingly recognized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> could play a
        significant role in modulating intracellular antioxidant
        defence mechanisms. Moreover, we found the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> dramatically influenced the cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of alpha-tocopherol, i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-tocopherol
        promoted the accumulation of alpha-tocopherol. If these
        results could be extrapolated to 
        in vivo conditions they suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-tocopherol</ENAMEX> is selectively taken up by cells and
        removed from plasma more rapidly than alpha-tocopherol.
        This could, in part, contribute to the selective
        maintenance of alpha-tocopherol in plasma compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-tocopherol.</ENAMEX>
