        The DNA damage checkpoint of eukaryotic cells helps
        ensure that DNA damage is repaired before it causes
        permanent, genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alterations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . To accomplish
        this, the checkpoint monitors the genome for damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Once damage is sensed, the checkpoint delays the cell cycle
        to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair enzymes sufficient time to execute
        their activities. Evidence also shows that checkpoint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins interface</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The
        importance of this genomic surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> in humans
        is underscored by the discovery that mutated DNA damage
        checkpoint genes are associated with an increased incidence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Many components of the DNA damage checkpoint have been
        isolated in yeast genetic screens designed to identify
        mutants that continued cell cycle progression in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Combined
        with recent genetic and biochemical data, it is now
        understood that the DNA damage checkpoint is a signal
        transduction cascade containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sensor</ENAMEX>, transducer and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receiver proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX>, the checkpoint 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rad</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
        hus1 +, 
        rad1 +, 
        rad3 +, 
        rad9 +, 
        rad17 +and 
        rad26 +) and 
        chk1 +manage the sensing and
        transducing operations of the DNA damage checkpoint [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 16</NUMEX>
        ] . Current data suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX>-kinase complex
        initially senses DNA damage by an unknown mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        . This response leads to an increase in the kinase activity
        of the complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , which phosphorylates and activates
        the transducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chk1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Finally, Chk1
        delays mitotic entry by targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc25 and Wee1</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of cyclin-dependent kinase activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Hus1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad9 and Rad17</TIMEX> facilitate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX>-dependent phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chk1</TIMEX>. For instance,
        they are dispensable for DNA damage-dependent activation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX>-kinase complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , but are required for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad3</NUMEX>-dependent phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chk1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Structural predictions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hus1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad1 and Rad9</TIMEX> have led to
        the proposal that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> fold similarly to the subunits
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen</ENAMEX> (PCNA) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Consistent with these predictions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> exists as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homotrimer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hus1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad1 and Rad9</TIMEX> all interact
        and possibly form a heterotrimer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 28</NUMEX> ] . In addition,
        Rad17 has sequence similarity and physical interactions
        with subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Replication Factor C</ENAMEX> (RFC) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        Based on the RFC-PCNA paradigm, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad17</NUMEX>-RFC <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may
        load the PCNA-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad9-Rad1</ENAMEX>-Hus1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9-1-1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> onto
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> discovered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex. From
        this location, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-1-1</ENAMEX> complex may link the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/</ENAMEX>Rad3
        complex with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chk1</TIMEX>.
        Rad3 is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the phosphoinositide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase
        related kinase (PIKK) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 200 kDa</NUMEX>) and share a domain related to the
        catalytic domain of phosphoinositide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PI-3</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX>). However, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIKKs</ENAMEX> are not known
        to phosphorylate lipids but do possess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
        activity. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIKK</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> also function to
        orchestrate eukaryotic genotoxic stress responses,
        including human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent protein</ENAMEX> kinase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PKcs), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEL1 and MEC1</TIMEX> of 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mei</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVSB</ENAMEX> of 
        Aspergillus nidulans [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 32 33 34</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Rad26 is a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3 complex</ENAMEX>
        that is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad3</TIMEX> kinase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Following DNA damage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">undergoes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Rad26 is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa protein
        containing little informative sequence information beyond a
        predicted coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and a basic stretch that
        resembles a nuclear localization signal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 32</NUMEX> ] .
        Functionally conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with very weak sequence
        similarity have been found in human (ATRIP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCD1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aka DDC2</ENAMEX> and
        PIE1) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] and 
        A. nidulans (UVSD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> also exist in budding yeast
        and human. In budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LCD1 Rad26physically</ENAMEX> interacts
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEC1 Rad3and</ENAMEX> is phosphorylated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEC1</NUMEX> Rad3following
        DNA damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . Likewise, human ATRIP
        Rad26physically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3and</ENAMEX> also undergoes
        DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26</ENAMEX> is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad3</TIMEX> kinase activity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , but LCD1 Rad26is not required for
        MEC1 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad3kinase</TIMEX> activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] while ATRIP Rad26is
        required for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3expression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the
        role of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can differ among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        The checkpoint system in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> also allows cells
        to recover from checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 39</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . Together with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Checkpoint</ENAMEX> Rad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex controls this genetically defined
        pathway that likely regulates DNA repair activities. For
        instance, 
        rad26.T12 cells undergo
        checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest, but lose viability
        upon re-entry into the cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The 
        rad26.T12 mutation acts by reducing
        the stability and activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3 checkpoint</ENAMEX>
        complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that cell cycle arrest requires
        only a pulse of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> kinase activity while recovery
        may require more. Therefore, quantitative differences in
        the kinase activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad3/Rad26</ENAMEX> complex may direct
        the cell cycle arrest and recovery pathways.
        Here, we investigated how the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex detects
        DNA damage. Using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, we found that
        the nuclei of cycling cells contained, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        Rad26-GFP dots of low fluorescent intensity. Combined with
        our observations that 
        rad26Δ and 
        rad3Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are sensitive to a
        microtubule depolymerizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, we speculate that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex may associate with heterochromatin.
        Following treatment with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damaging agent
        Bleomycin, we observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. Nearly all nuclei (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>) contained small,
        numerous Rad26-GFP speckles, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 50%</NUMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> also contained one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very bright Rad26-GFP
        spots. Results obtained with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX>.T12-GFP fusion protein
        suggest that the speckles are linked to repair activities,
        and the bright spots play a role in checkpoint-dependent
        cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, these Rad26-GFP
        localization patterns appeared normal in 
        hus1Δ , 
        rad1Δ , 
        rad9Δ , 
        rad17Δ , and 
        rad3Δ backgrounds. Therefore, Rad26
        can orchestrate early events of the DNA damage checkpoint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> without these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including its catalytic

          Rad26 is a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad3</NUMEX> checkpoint
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . To investigate the cellular distribution
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX>, we used a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based gene-modification
          method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] to fuse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S65T</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
          genomic copy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">rad26</NUMEX> +. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP fusion protein
          maintained proper checkpoint function following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyurea</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HU</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatments (data not
          shown).
          Since the background fluorescence in live, cycling
          cells was too high to derive conclusions about Rad26-GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> (data not shown), we prepared cells using a
          technique previously described in a study of fission
          yeast chromatin binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . An asynchronous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cycling cells was first permeabilized using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zymolyase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seikagaku Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>), then extracted with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> and finally fixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>. We did
          not observe GFP-fluorescence in negative-control, 
          rad26 +cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). However, 
          rad26-GFP cells contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">GFP</ENAMEX> dots (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> on average, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>; Figure
          1B). Non-extracted 
          rad26-GFP cells, prepared in an
          otherwise identical manner, retained this
          GFP-fluorescence pattern (data not shown). We also
          obtained similar results using paraformaldehyde fixation,
          however in this case non-specific cytoplasmic background
          fluorescence was higher (data not shown).
        
        
          Rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP Localization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cycling Cells</ENAMEX> does not
          depend on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Checkpoint Rad Proteins</ENAMEX>
          Next, we tested if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> localization to dots in
          cycling cells depended upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Checkpoint Rad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The 
          rad26-GFP allele was crossed into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> checkpoint 
          radΔ alleles ( 
          hus1Δ , 
          rad1Δ , 
          rad9Δ , 
          rad17Δ and 
          rad3Δ ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> localization
          was assayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Triton X</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-100</ENAMEX> extracted cells. None of the
          checkpoint 
          radΔ alleles affected Rad26-GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> in cycling cells, although we did observe a
          slight decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> in these genetic backgrounds ( 
          rad9Δ, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">rad26</NUMEX>-GFP cells are shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1C</TIMEX>; 
          hus1Δ ,

          rad26-GFP are not shown).
          Therefore, the checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rad proteins</ENAMEX> are not required
          for proper localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP in cycling
          cells.

          First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26 and Rad3</TIMEX> are required to maintain proper

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chromatin-immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>)
          experiments demonstrate that over-expressed Rad3-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
          exists at telomeres [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dots</ENAMEX> in the nuclei of cycling cells (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiological</ENAMEX> experiments can also be used to
          characterize heterochromatin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
          For example, absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Swi6</ENAMEX> in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> sensitizes
          cells to thiabendazole (TBZ), a microtubule
          depolymerizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Presumably this occurs
          because absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Swi6</ENAMEX> disrupts centromeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> and, as a result, sensitizes cells to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that compromise spindle function. To test whether
          checkpoint mutants are sensitive to microtubule
          depolymerization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, we spotted serial dilutions of
          cultures on plates containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX>. As shown,
          both 
          rad26Δ and 
          rad3Δ cells were sensitive to TBZ
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Mutations that disrupt the microtubule
          cytoskeleton are also known to sensitize cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] . However, using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-tubulin</ENAMEX> immunofluorescence, we
          did not discover any gross microtubule cytoskeletal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in

          rad3Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> lead us to speculate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3 complex</ENAMEX>
          possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with centromeric heterochromatin in
          cycling cells. We are currently testing this

          cycle arrest following treatment with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA damage agent</ENAMEX>,
          but lose viability upon re-entry into the cell cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . We found that the 
          rad26.T12 strain is significantly
          less sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> than 
          rad26Δ and 
          rad3Δ (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          deficiencies in the recovery activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rad26</ENAMEX> are not
          related to this TBZ-phenotype.
        
        
          Checkpoint rad mutants do not share TBZ
          Sensitivity
          Next, we tested if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other checkpoint 
          radΔ alleles ( 
          hus1Δ, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rad1Δ</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rad9Δ</ENAMEX> and 
          rad17Δ ) conferred TBZ sensitivity
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Interestingly, 
          rad9Δ and 
          rad1Δ , but not 
          rad17Δ and 
          hus1Δ , shared this phenotype.
          Since each of the checkpoint 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rads</ENAMEX> is an essential component of
          the checkpoint, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> sensitivity can not be the indirect
          result of defects in the checkpoint response.
          The kinase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX> is essential for
          checkpoint signaling and is the only known biochemical
          function of this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . The 
          rad3.a strain has an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          change (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D2230A</NUMEX>) in the conserved kinase domain of Rad3
          that eliminates cell cycle arrest in response to DNA
          damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, we found that
          the 
          rad3.a strain is less sensitive to
          TBZ than the 
          rad3Δ and 
          rad26Δ strains (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> sensitivity is caused by more than loss of
          Rad3-kinase activity alone.
        
        
          Rad26-GFP Spots and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speckles</ENAMEX> Form in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX> to
          DNA Damage
          To test if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> localization changes in response
          to DNA damage, a culture of 
          rad26-GFP cells was grown to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid-</ENAMEX>log phase (optical density <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX>) and then treated with
          Bleomycin, a radiomimetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX> staining. The 
          rad26-GFP cells underwent a normal,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX> response following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment and
          arrested cell cycle progression with one nucleus in a
          long cell (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). We observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct patterns
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>-fluorescence in these treated cells. First, nearly
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>) contained many small foci that we call
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speckles</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). These speckles are different than
          the larger, less numerous dots (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> on average) that we
          observed in untreated, cycling cells (compare Figure
          1Bwith Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of
          Bleomycin-treated cells also contained one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bright,
          nuclear spots (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>; arrow denotes the speckles that
          formed in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>). We found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of untreated,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cycling rad26</ENAMEX>-GFP cells contained one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Rad26-GFP
          spots, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treated, 
          rad26-GFP cells formed these spots
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Since we also observed these spots in live,
          Bleomycin-treated 
          rad26-GFP cells (data not shown),
          these results were not affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol fixation</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, both spots and speckles formed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> addition (data not shown). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> show that speckles and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> bright, nuclear
          Rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots form in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX>-treated cells.
          These changes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP localization could be a
          direct response to the DNA damage caused by Bleomycin
          treatment, or an indirect consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> cell cycle
          arrest that occurs after checkpoint-activation. The 
          cdc25 +gene encodes a positive
          mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] that is also a target of DNA
          damage checkpoint signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . At the restrictive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37°C</NUMEX>), the temperature-sensitive 
          cdc25<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> allele causes cells to
          arrest at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> boundary [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . To test if these
          Bleomycin-induced patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence
          formed as an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest,
          we crossed the 
          cdc25.22 mutation into a 
          rad26-GFP background. A 
          cdc25<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> rad26-GFP strain was
          isolated and grown to mid-log phase before shifting to
          the restrictive temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>. This caused the
          cells to arrest cell cycle progression with a single
          nucleus in a long cell (data not shown), but did not
          increase the formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speckles</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These data suggest that both
          patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence (spots and speckles)
          occur as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage, as opposed to the
          checkpoint-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> cell cycle delay that follows
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment.
        
        
          Formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP Spots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speckles</ENAMEX> after DNA
          Damage does not require Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Checkpoint</ENAMEX> Rad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>
          Next, we tested if these patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> formed in other checkpoint 
          radΔ cells. Similar to results
          obtained in a wild-type background, we observed that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 48% and 56%</NUMEX> of checkpoint 
          radΔ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bright</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Cand 7</NUMEX>). We also observed that some of these
          cells contained Rad26-GFP speckles (arrow in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>).
          However, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP signal in 
          radΔ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was slightly weaker than
          what we observed in a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rad</ENAMEX> +background (compare Figure
          5Cwith <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX>), and we were unable to confidently
          determine the efficiency by which 
          radΔ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speckles</ENAMEX> following DNA damage.
          An elevated number of untreated, cycling checkpoint 
          radΔ cells contained one or two
          bright Rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots. While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of untreated 
          rad26-GFP cells contained these
          spots, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 3% and 7%</NUMEX> of untreated, checkpoint 
          radΔ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed them (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          The spots may form in response to spontaneous DNA damage
          that can arise during a typical cell cycle, and the
          absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hus1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad9</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad17</TIMEX> may increase
          these events.
          We also tested if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX> kinase activity was required
          for re-localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> following Bleomycin
          treatment. However, neither the 
          rad3.a nor a 
          rad3Δ allele significantly affected
          the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> to form the bright foci
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          Rad26 can respond to DNA damage in the absence of
          Rad3.
        
        
          Rad26-GFP Spots are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cell Cycle</ENAMEX>
          Arrest, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speckles</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recovery</ENAMEX>
          Rad26 functions in checkpoint cell cycle arrest and
          recovery pathways. A mutant allele, 
          rad26.T12 , genetically separates
          these functions, since 
          rad26.T12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can undergo
          checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest but fail to recover
          and lose viability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 40</NUMEX> ] . To determine if spots and
          speckles are associated with these different Rad26
          functions, we tagged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX>.T12 with GFP
          using the same primers and method that we used to tag
          Rad26 (see Methods). After confirming that the 
          rad26.T12-GFP strain behaved
          similarly to a 
          rad26.T12 strain in response to
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HU</ENAMEX> (data not shown), we investigated
          Rad26.T12-GFP localization following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment.
          We observed that bright spots formed in both 
          rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> and 
          rad26.T12-GFP cells that had been
          extracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> prior to microscopy (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10Aand 10B</ENAMEX>). We also observed speckles in 
          rad26-GFP cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10A</NUMEX>) but
          did not identify these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX>-treated 
          rad26.T12-GFP cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10B</NUMEX>).
          Likewise, both spots and speckles formed in
          paraformaldehyde-fixed 
          rad26-GFP cells, while only spots
          formed in 
          rad26.T12-GFP cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10C</NUMEX>).
          These data link the bright, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots with the cell
          cycle arrest activities of the DNA damage checkpoint, and
          suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> speckles play a role in
          recovery.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Dots, spots and speckles: cytology of
          Rad26-GFP
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex plays a critical role in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX> response to DNA damage in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Here,
          we studied the cytological events that may be associated
          with these functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
          In normal cycling cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP localized to
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> dots (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). After DNA damage,
          Rad26-GFP localized to numerous smaller foci called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speckles</ENAMEX> (compare Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band 5A</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> half
          of these damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> also contained one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bright
          Rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>). In this discussion we
          consider the location and function of these distinct,
          cytological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dots: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP localization in normal cycling
          cells
          For technical reasons we were unable to conclusively
          identify these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>), but for a number
          of reasons we believe that they may be associated with
          sites of heterochromatin. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dots</ENAMEX> were
          resistant to an extraction method that was developed to
          specifically-preserve the localization of
          chromatin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, we
          discovered that the 
          rad26Δ strain is sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX>,
          a phenotype common to mutants that disrupt
          centromeric-heterochromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Finally, fission
          yeast has a relatively small number of heterochromatic
          regions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> centromeres, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> telomeres, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mating-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54</NUMEX> ] ) and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> dots we
          observe is roughly consistent with localization to these
          regions. In addition, other studies have revealed a
          functional role for checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rad proteins</ENAMEX> in telomere
          maintenance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] , while one has shown that an
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed, epitope tagged version of Rad3 associates
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">telomeric DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . It will be interesting to
          determine if checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have a role in
          centromere function, or mating-type silencing, both of
          which require intact heterochromatic structures.
          Alternative explanations exist. For example, the
          microtubule cytoskeleton has been implicated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombination-dependent DNA</ENAMEX> repair processes in budding
          yeast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . The TBZ-sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage
          checkpoint mutants, such as 
          rad26Δ and 
          rad3Δ , may indicate that
          checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> cooperate with the cytoskeleton
          during such repair.
        
        
          TBZ sensitivity reveals novel aspects of checkpoint
          Rad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function
          The TBZ sensitivity assay identifies distinct
          functions of checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rad proteins</ENAMEX>. In particular, 
          rad1Δ and 
          rad9Δ are also sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX>,
          while 
          rad17Δ and 
          hus1Δ are not (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Studies
          suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hus1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad1</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad9</NUMEX> function together to
          form a PCNA-like clamp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that is loaded onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by
          Rad17 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This model predicts that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> proteins
          should show the same levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> sensitivity since
          deletion of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> should prevent
          formation of a functional clamp. The TBZ-data shown here
          suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least Rad1 and Rad9</TIMEX> have roles that are
          independent of their function in the PCNA-like clamp.
          In addition, we found that 
          rad3.a , a mutation that disrupts
          Rad3 kinase activity, confers less TBZ sensitivity than a
          
          rad3Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). To our
          knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to detect
          physiological differences between a kinase-dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> of
          
          rad3 +and a full deletion. This
          demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX> has a biochemical activity in
          addition to its catalytic kinase activity.
          TBZ sensitivity may reveal a novel role for checkpoint
          Rad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that is independent of the DNA damage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX> response. Alternatively, some structure that
          is required to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBZ</ENAMEX> sensitivity, such as
          centromeric heterochromatin, may function in checkpoint
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Possibly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex localizes to
          regions of heterochromatin (centromeres, telomeres and
          the mating type loci) in undamaged cells. From these
          vantage points, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex may survey the
          entire genome for DNA damage. For example,
          heterochromatin functions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
          chromatin, the cohesive force existing between
          chromatids, and the tension on chromosomes produced by
          the spindle apparatus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] . DNA damage may produce
          changes in these elements. By localizing to
          heterochromatic regions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX> complex possibly
          monitors such elements to perceive DNA damage on a
          genome-wide scale.
        
        
          Spots and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speckles</ENAMEX>: localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP in
          response to DNA damage
          Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> treatment, the
          Rad26-GFP dots found in cycling cells were replaced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speckles</ENAMEX> and spots (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>). Both of these
          Rad26-GFP patterns were absent from G2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/M</ENAMEX> arrested 
          cdc25<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> rad26-GFP cells (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), so they likely resulted from Bleomycin-induced DNA
          damage as opposed to checkpoint-induced cell cycle
          arrest. Also, both types of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP patterns formed
          independently of the other checkpoint Rad proteins
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Cand 7</NUMEX>), and did not require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rad3</NUMEX> kinase
          activity or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rad3</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Together, these analyses
          suggest that the cytological changes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP are
          very early steps in the process of checkpoint activation
          that are directed entirely by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX>.
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">speckle</ENAMEX> formation was compromised in
          Bleomycin-treated 
          rad26.T12-GFP cells, which are cell
          cycle arrest-proficient but recovery-deficient (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). In contrast, formation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rad26</TIMEX>.T12-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> spots
          occurred normally after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bleomycin</ENAMEX>-treatment (Figures 9and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). These results suggest that the speckles could be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair and recovery activities, while
          the spots could be associated with cell cycle arrest.
          Following ultraviolet radiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">paraformaldehyde fixation and Triton X-100</ENAMEX> extraction,
          Cortez 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] found that ATRIP
          Rad26and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3also</ENAMEX> re-localize to a large number of
          intranuclear foci. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair activities may take place
          at these foci since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> has been shown to co-localize
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> in damage-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foci</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Using elegant
          methods to test for direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage
          checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at double strand breaks 
          in vivo , other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have shown
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEC1 Rad3-HA and LCD1 Rad26-GFP</ENAMEX> localize to sites of
          DNA damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 60</NUMEX> ] . However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MEC1</TIMEX> was required for
          this re-localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LCD1</NUMEX>-GFP 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . Thus, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad26/Rad3</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to sites
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair may be evolutionarily conserved, the
          regulation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> is not.
          Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATRIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LCD1-GFP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> also localizes to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bright spots following DNA damage (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          We speculate that these spots could represent "control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>" where various kinds of information about the
          status of the genome is integrated with cell cycle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. We tested if these spots
          were associated with the spindle pole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (SPB), given
          that an ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> of the checkpoint signal, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc2</TIMEX>,
          resides at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPB</ENAMEX> prior to mitosis in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
          ] . However, these Rad26-GFP foci did not co-localize
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">SPB marker</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sad1</TIMEX> (data not shown) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have discovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct Rad26-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> cellular
        structures. Since formation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> did not
        require other checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad3</ENAMEX>, we
        believe that they represent very early steps in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX> response to damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that may be controlled
        entirely by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX>.
        In normal cycling cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX>-GFP localized to a small
        number of dots that may function as surveillance centers
        and monitor the genome for DNA damage. After damage,
        Rad26-GFP localization to speckles may correspond to the
        direct interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of damage. At the
        bright spots, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad26</TIMEX> may integrate various kinds of
        information about the status of the genome with cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. Further study of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and their
        regulation could provide important new information about
        the early steps in DNA damage detection and the checkpoint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Strains, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Growth Conditions</ENAMEX> and Physiological
          Methods
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) were grown at
          30°C under standard conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] unless noted
          otherwise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) was prepared
          as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX> stock solution in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and kept at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX>. To
          activate the DNA damage checkpoint, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bleomycin</ENAMEX> was added
          to cultures (optical density of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX>) at a concentration
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mU</ENAMEX>/ml for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiabendazole</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) was
          prepared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] and added
          to cooled, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">YE5S agar</ENAMEX> prior to pouring plates. We did not
          observe an affect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> on the growth of any strains
          used in this study (data not shown).
          To arrest the 
          cdc25<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> rad26-GFP strain at the
          G2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/M</ENAMEX> boundary, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TE1198</TIMEX> was grown at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">30°C</NUMEX> in liquid,
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.D. 0.3</ENAMEX>. Next, cells were collected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> and re-inoculated to the same density in
          pre-warmed 37°C liquid media. They were grown for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>
          at this temperature to cause cell cycle arrest at the
          G2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/M</ENAMEX> boundary before fixation.
        
        
          Microscopy
          To observe Rad26-GFP in live cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> were grown
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YE5S</TIMEX> liquid medium to an optical density of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>,
          washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in phosphate buffered saline (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>)
          and mounted on poly-L-lysine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) coated coverslips
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uva</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nl/pombe/handbook.</ENAMEX> A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 </NUMEX>l volume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slowfade Component A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR) was
          placed on the coverslips, which were finally mounted on
          glass slides. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zeiss Axioskop 2</ENAMEX> was used to observe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>, and images were captured with the SenSys
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photometrics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>) and processed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lab</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>).
          To paraformaldehyde-fix cells, ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) stock solution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] was added to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> in yeast
          cultures for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> before cells were washed and
          mounted on coverslips. Alternatively, cells were
          extracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol fixation</ENAMEX>, as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . To visualize nuclei, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">μg</ENAMEX>/ml <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</NUMEX> (DAPI) was added to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slowfade Component A.</ENAMEX>
          To observe the microtubule cytoskeletons of 
          rad26Δ and 
          rad3Δ , cells were processed for
          immunofluorescence microscopy using standard combined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aldehyde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>) fixation and TAT1
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rad26-GFP Strains</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two long primers</TIMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATGTGGGTGCGGGACGGGAAAGAACAACACTGAAGAAACAAGTATCATTATTTCATTTGAAAAATTAGGGAAATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC</ENAMEX>)
          were used to amplify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S65T</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kanMX6</NUMEX> module of
          pFA6a-GFP (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S65T</NUMEX>)-kanMX6 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> separate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μl</NUMEX> PCR
          reactions using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accuzyme</ENAMEX>, high-fidelity polymerase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bioline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Randolph</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). These primers contain sequences
          that are homologous to those that flank both sides of the
          
          rad26 +STOP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . By
          homologous integration, they direct integration of GFP
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S65T</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end of 
          rad26 +. The PCR-product was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooled</ENAMEX>, extracted with phenol:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chloroform:isoamyl alcohol</ENAMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25:24:</TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), precipitated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and dissolved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was then used to transform TE696 ( 
          rad26 +) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TE1102</TIMEX> ( 
          rad26.T12 ) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geneticin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>

          Bahler 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Integrants were
          verified by Western blotting using anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rad26</NUMEX> polyclonal
          antibodies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] to show that the genomic copy of 
          rad26 +or 
          rad26.T12 had been replaced by 
          rad26-GFP or 
          rad26.T12-GFP , respectively (data
          not shown). Rad26-GFP was followed through crosses using
          Geneticin-resistance and Western blotting to confirm that
          
          rad26 +was completely replaced with
          
          rad26-GFP (data not shown).
