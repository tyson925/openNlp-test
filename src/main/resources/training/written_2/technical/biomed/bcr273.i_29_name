          Introduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemoprevention</ENAMEX> has been defined as the use of
          noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to enhance
          intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> against the development of mutant clones and
          their progression to malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In a recent
          landmark trial, tamoxifen, a hormonally active selective
          estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor modulator</ENAMEX> (SERM), was shown to decrease
          the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive breast cancer</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> in
          asymptomatic, but at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The search is now
          on for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with improved risk-benefit profiles, and
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that will prevent the subclass of estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-negative tumors, the incidence of which was
          unaffected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMS</ENAMEX>. Retinoids have already shown
          potential in this regard [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Because it
          will not be possible to test many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in large
          randomized clinical trials, efforts are underway to
          develop useful tissue-based surrogate end-point
          biomarkers that can be used to select only the most
          promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (and doses) for large-scale trials.
          Provocative mechanistic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> have been made
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">superfamily</ENAMEX>, including the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMS</ENAMEX> and retinoids, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          multifunctional growth factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β</ENAMEX> system has
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor activity, and loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β response is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with advanced disease in many human tumor
          types, including the breast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Conversely,
          experimental overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β in the mammary gland
          protects against tumorigenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. This strongly
          suggests that interventions that enhance TGF-β function
          early in tumorigenesis could delay or prevent the course
          of the disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SERMs</ENAMEX> such as tamoxifen can upregulate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β production and activation by many cell types,
          including human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. Similarly, retinoids can upregulate TGF-β production
          and activation, both in cell culture and in rats 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. It is plausible,
          therefore, that upregulation of endogenous TGF-β could
          contribute to the chemopreventive efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoids</ENAMEX>.
          In the present study we used a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX>-induced rat
          mammary carcinogenesis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to test the hypothesis that
          chemoprevention by tamoxifen and retinoids is associated
          with local upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the mammary gland,
          and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs might therefore be useful as potential
          surrogate end-point biomarkers of chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> in clinical trials.
        
        
          Materials and methods
          A standard protocol for induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">female Sprague-Dawley</ENAMEX> rats using a single dose of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nitroso</NUMEX>- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -methylurea</ENAMEX> (NMU) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of
          age was used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 18</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemopreventive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were
          incorporated into powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab chow</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and fed 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> , beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> after
          injection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMU</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were fed 9cRA (Kuraray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of diet, tamoxifen
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Unit</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spring House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">782</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of diet.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were weighed and palpated for the presence of
          mammary tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> in each experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were sacrificed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 12 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment
          with chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. For experiments to determine
          the effect of high doses of tamoxifen administered over
          shorter periods of time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tamoxifen/kg</ENAMEX> body weight per day intragastrically, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          mg <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tamoxifen</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> in the diet, and were sacrificed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day or 3 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment. All palpated tumors were
          confirmed at necropsy, and mammary glands were fixed in
          neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. The
          number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thoracic) mammary gland was sectioned for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histology</ENAMEX> and immunohistochemistry.
          Immunohistochemical staining was done using rabbit
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> raised against synthetic peptides
          that correspond to regions in the mature forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (sc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> Biotechnologies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), and anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX>-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 -LC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], respectively. Anti-latent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP; Ab39</ENAMEX>) was raised against the
          purified full-length platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The antibodies
          were affinity purified against the immunizing peptide
          (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) or against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A sepharose
          (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -LC, anti-TGF-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX> and anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). Immunohistochemical staining was
          performed using an indirect immunoperoxidase detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vectastain Elite</ENAMEX> kit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Staining intensity was scored on a
          scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>+, using the mouse embryo control section as
          a reference standard for each run. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ducts</ENAMEX> and periductal
          stroma were scored independently. Staining was scored in
          a blinded manner by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, and
          discrepancies were rescored by consensus. Staining
          intensity was plotted as the mean ± standard deviation
          for each experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Results
          Palpable mammary tumors were first detected after
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 days</TIMEX> following initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMU</ENAMEX>, and by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 days</TIMEX> incidence had reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> in rats not treated
          with chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). Tamoxifen, alone
          or in combination with retinoids, decreased tumor
          incidence by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> by the end of the study,
          whereas 9cRA alone decreased it by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPR</ENAMEX> alone had a
          relatively modest effect on tumor incidence in the
          present study. However, it significantly decreased tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplicity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b), indicating that the dose used was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacious</ENAMEX>. There was minimal toxicity associated with
          the chemopreventive intervention, except in the tamoxifen
          + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, in which mild toxicity was observed, as
          judged by the weights of the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1c).
          None of the chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> used, alone or in
          combination, were found to affect expression of any of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β isoforms or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> in either ductal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> or periductal stroma after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> of
          chemopreventive intervention (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-week</TIMEX> time
          point was chosen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the period of
          preneoplasia, as the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had no
          palpable tumors at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In the study set,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) of the slides showed histologic
          evidence of hyperplasia, one out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> had a ductal
          carcinoma 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (mammary intraepithelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplasia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> had a carcinoma. We
          further investigated the effect of tamoxifen at higher
          doses and earlier time points. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> that received
          tamoxifen at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per day intragastrically
          (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day for a human) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per day
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intragastrically</ENAMEX> (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day for a human)
          for either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX>, again no consistent changes
          were seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression, using either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Discussion
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major goal in the field of prevention is the
          identification of surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">biomarkers</ENAMEX> that might rapidly
          predict the effect of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on the primary
          end-point of cancer incidence. The most informative
          markers are those with modulation that is likely to be
          directly related to the preventive effect, and a
          compelling argument can be made that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs may fall into
          this category. However, the present data in a
          well-established preclinical model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>,
          employing a variety of highly effective chemopreventive
          regimens, suggest that this is not the case.
          Most of the previous studies on the regulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs by tamoxifen and retinoids have been done in
          tissue culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 17</TIMEX>]. The lack of effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression in the present 
          in vivo study may reflect the
          dependence of the response on contextual cues that are
          only present in the artificial 
          in vitro environment. In an 
          in vivo study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], all- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was shown to
          cause an upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β isoforms in rats, with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> and isoform selectivity that varied with the
          target tissue. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were vitamin
          A-deficient, and it is not known whether the same effects
          would be seen in vitamin A-replete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> such as were
          used in the present study. In a small study in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>] tamoxifen treatment was shown to cause a consistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in extracellular TGF-β in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX>, when compared with pretreatment biopsies from
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and complex effects of tamoxifen on
          induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the plasma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> have been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. It is
          possible that tamoxifen is only effective in inducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β in the context of a tumor, and not in the normal or
          initiated tissue that was the subject of the present
          study. However, an optimal surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">end-point</ENAMEX> biomarker
          in a prevention setting needs to be modulated in normal
          or premalignant tissues. Although we cannot eliminate the
          possibility of more subtle effects of chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on TGF-β bioavailability or cellular
          responsiveness, in our preliminary analyses we have seen
          no effects on the expression of type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> TGF-β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          There is considerable evidence to suggest that, at
          late stages in tumorigenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs can actually promote
          the tumorigenic process, particularly if the epithelial
          cells have lost responsiveness to the growth inhibitory
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β by this time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. While the present
          work was in progress, a study was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] that
          showed that loss of the type <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> can
          already be seen in a significant fraction of hyperplasias
          without atypia in the human breast. Furthermore, loss of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> correlated with increased risk of subsequent
          development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Thus, loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β response may be a very early event in the
          development of human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Because locally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated TGF</ENAMEX>-β levels could select for TGF-β-resistant
          cells, and because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs can have oncogenic effects on
          the stroma, it may actually be important for the safety
          profile of chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to demonstrate that
          they do not increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β levels in the at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>.
          In this regard, this demonstration that the expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">preclinical rat</ENAMEX> model is unaffected by
          tamoxifen, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9cRA</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR may actually have positive
          implications, because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are already in
          clinical use.
          The NMU-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of mammary tumorigenesis is
          widely used for chemoprevention studies, and yields rapid
          development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> incidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 18</ENAMEX>]. To do this, the initiating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is given at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX> and the chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</TIMEX>, during the period of
          active development of the mammary gland. We observed that
          the histology of the tamoxifen-treated mammary glands
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> significantly from control glands when examined
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> of tamoxifen treatment, showing fewer
          terminal end-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> and less tertiary branching. Part of
          the chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoids</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> may therefore be due to a
          generalized decrease in ductal development. Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are unlikely to be given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pubertal period</TIMEX>, this form of preclinical
          model may not accurately reflect the degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> benefit that could be achieved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
          Although the accelerated time course and high penetrance
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> reduces the costs of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, it may be
          advisable to confirm efficacy of promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in a
          model that delays application of the chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> until the mammary gland is fully developed.
          In conclusion, we have shown that treatment of rats
          with tamoxifen or retinoids results in effective
          chemoprevention of mammary tumorigenesis, without any
          detectable effect on local expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs. Although
          we cannot rule out more subtle effects on TGF-β activity,
          such as the activation of latent forms, the data suggest
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs are not involved in the underlying molecular
          mechanism of chemoprevention induced by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
          This agrees with 
          in vitro work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] that showed
          that blockade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β signaling did not abrogate the
          growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          cells. Given the very limited breast tissue available in
          clinical trials, we do not recommend testing for TGF-βs
          as a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">end-point</ENAMEX> biomarkers at this time.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β isoforms and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> (part of the
          naturally occurring latent TGF-β <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>) showed broadly
          similar immunostaining patterns in the mammary glands of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated rats</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 weeks of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). They were
          present both in the ductal epithelium and in the
          periductal stroma, suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs are
          synthesized by the epithelial cells, and possibly stromal
          cells, and are sequestered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>.
          This staining pattern is consistent with a role for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the maintenance of normal mammary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment, we noticed that mammary
          glands from tamoxifen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were less developed
          than those of untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, having fewer
          tertiary ducts and terminal end <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>, and they could
          consistently be identified from a blind data set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> had a significant effect on glandular histology,
          with tamoxifen and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9cRA</TIMEX> showing the greatest suppression
          of ductal development and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobule</ENAMEX> formation, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR
          showing a relatively mild effect.

          Introduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemoprevention</ENAMEX> has been defined as the use of
          noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to enhance
          intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> against the development of mutant clones and
          their progression to malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of
          the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor superfamily</ENAMEX> are considered to be
          particularly promising targets for chemoprevention,
          because of their pivotal role in the regulation of
          metabolic, developmental, and differentiation pathways [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>]. In a recent landmark trial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], tamoxifen, a
          hormonally active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERM</ENAMEX>, was shown to decrease the risk of
          invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> in asymptomatic, but
          at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERM</ENAMEX>, raloxifene, also shows
          promise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. These studies validate the concept of
          using pharmacologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for prevention of human breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in apparently healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
          The search is now on for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with improved
          risk-benefit profiles, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that will prevent
          the subclass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor-negative tumors, the
          incidence of which was unaffected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMS</ENAMEX>.
          Retinoids, a family of compounds structurally related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin A</ENAMEX>, have already shown potential in this regard [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Since it will not be possible to test
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in large randomized clinical trials, efforts
          are underway to develop useful tissue-based surrogate
          end-point biomarkers that can be used to select only the
          most promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (and doses) for large-scale
          trials.
          Provocative mechanistic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> have been made
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">superfamily</ENAMEX>, including the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMS</ENAMEX> and retinoids, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          multifunctional growth factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs are potent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the growth of many epithelial cell types [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. Recent work has implicated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β</ENAMEX> system as an
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor pathway, and loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          response is associated with advanced disease in many
          human tumor types, including the breast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 30, 31</TIMEX>].
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models, over-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the mammary gland protects
          against tumorigenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], whereas local inactivation
          of the type <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor enhances tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. This strongly suggests that interventions that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhance TGF</ENAMEX>-β function early in tumorigenesis could delay
          or prevent the course of the disease.
          Antiestrogens such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> have been shown to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β</ENAMEX> production and activation by many cell
          types, including human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Similarly, retinoids can upregulate TGF-β
          production and activation, both in cell culture and in
          rats 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. Therefore, it is
          reasonable to propose that some of the chemopreventive
          efficacy of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> 
          in vivo could be mediated via a
          local upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs, with concomitant
          enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor activity.
          In the present study, we used a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX>-induced rat
          model of mammary carcinogenesis to test whether
          chemoprevention by tamoxifen and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoids</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR, also known as fenretinide; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cRA)
          is associated with local upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the
          initiated mammary gland. If this were the case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs
          might be useful as potential surrogate end-point
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomarkers</ENAMEX> in clinical trials. However, the results show
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β levels, as detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunohistochemically</ENAMEX>, are
          not affected by tamoxifen or retinoids in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">preclinical</ENAMEX> model of early-stage breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.

          A standard protocol for induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">female Sprague</ENAMEX>-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 18</ENAMEX>], with
          initiation induced by a single intravenous dose of NMU
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body weight) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retinoids</ENAMEX> and
          tamoxifen were incorporated into powdered laboratory chow
          as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and fed

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were weighed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> and palpated for the presence
          of mammary tumors. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> in each experimental group
          were sacrificed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 12 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-week</TIMEX> sacrifice time was
          chosen for the immunohistochemical studies to represent
          the period of premalignancy, because the incidence of
          palpable tumors is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> for all experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at that time. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> all rats that have not
          received a chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> have tumors, so the
          primary purpose of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-week</TIMEX> sacrifice time was to
          allow an accurate determination of chemopreventive
          efficacy for the particular experiment.
          For experiments to determine the effect of high doses
          of tamoxifen administered over shorter periods of time,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mg <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tamoxifen</ENAMEX>/kg body weight per day
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intragastrically</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mg <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tamoxifen</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> in the diet, and
          were sacrificed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment.
          All palpated tumors were confirmed at necropsy, and
          mammary glands were fixed in neutral buffered formalin
          and embedded in paraffin. The number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thoracic)
          mammary gland was sectioned for histology and

          Immunohistochemistry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs
          Immunohistochemical staining was done using rabbit
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> raised against synthetic peptides
          that correspond to regions in the mature forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-30</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX>, and they recognize different epitopes
          of this peptide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The LC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> usually stains

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72-99</NUMEX> of the mature TGF-β

          against the purified full-length platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were affinity purified against the
          immunizing peptide (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) or against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A sepharose
          (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -LC, anti-TGF-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX>, and anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), and have been assayed for
          specificity by Western blot analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 33</TIMEX>]. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> reacted with the appropriate TGF-β isoform
          except anti-TGF-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX>, which showed some

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> on Western blots.
          Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an
          indirect immunoperoxidase detection protocol (Vectastain
          Elite kit; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>) following treatment of
          sections with hyaluronidase to improve antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penetration</ENAMEX>. Optimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> concentrations were
          determined by titration on select samples before analysis
          of the full experimental set. Staining was shown to be
          specific in control experiments in which either the
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was preincubated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-fold</NUMEX> molar
          excess of immunizing peptide before being applied to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ), or the section was stained with
          an equivalent concentration of nonimmune rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoglobulin</ENAMEX> (anti-TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -LC, anti-TGF-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX>, and anti-LTBP). In analysis of
          the full experimental set, for any given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> all
          sections were stained at the same time so as to be
          directly comparable, and a normal mouse embryo section
          was included as a positive control. A normal rabbit
          immunoglobulin control was also run for the whole
          set.
        
        
          Quantitation of immunostaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different systems were used to grade
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX>. For all samples, staining of the ducts

          samples after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> of chemopreventive treatment,
          staining intensity was scored on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>+, using
          the mouse embryo control section as a reference standard
          for each run. Staining was scored in a blinded manner by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, and scores never differed by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> point. Discrepancies were rescored by
          consensus. Staining intensity was plotted as the mean ±
          standard deviation for each experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Chemopreventive efficacy
          Palpable mammary tumors were first detected after
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 days</TIMEX> following initation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMU</ENAMEX>, and
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 days</TIMEX> incidence had reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> in rats not treated
          with chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). Tamoxifen, alone
          or in combination with retinoids, decreased tumor
          incidence by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> by the end of the study,
          whereas 9cRA alone decreased it by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPR</ENAMEX> alone had a
          relatively modest effect on tumor incidence in the
          present study. However, it significantly decreased tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplicity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b) indicating that the dose used was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacious</ENAMEX>. These incidence and multiplicity data are
          consistent with previously published studies using this
          model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 34</ENAMEX>]. The mean weights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> in the
          various experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> differed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX>
          from those of rats not treated with a chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> treated with a combination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR, in which the mean weight was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15%</NUMEX> lower than the that in untreated group
          by the end of the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c). This suggests that
          there was minimal toxicity associated with the
          chemopreventive intervention, except in the tamoxifen +
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, in which mild toxicity was observed.
        
        
          Effect of chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on TGF-β
          expression in initiated mammary gland
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the typical immunohistochemical staining
          pattern for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> (part of the
          naturally occurring latent TGF-β <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>) in initiated
          mammary glands of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-week-old rats</ENAMEX> that had not been
          treated with chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> showed broadly similar staining
          patterns. They were present both in the ductal epithelium
          and in the periductal stroma, suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs
          are synthesized by the epithelial cells, and possibly
          stromal cells, and are sequestered in the extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>. This staining pattern is consistent with a role
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the maintenance of normal mammary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX>.
          None of the chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> used, alone or in
          combination, were found to affect expression of any of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β isoforms or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> in either ductal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> or periductal stroma after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> of
          chemopreventive intervention (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-week</TIMEX> time
          point was chosen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the period of
          preneoplasia, because the majority (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) of the rats
          had no palpable tumors at this stage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
          clinical material for biomarker analysis in primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprevention</ENAMEX> studies is also likely to comprise normal
          and initiated, at-risk epithelium with some early
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preneoplastic</ENAMEX> changes, but without evidence of major
          neoplastic change.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6-week</TIMEX> study set, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glands</ENAMEX> sampled showed histologic evidence of hyperplasia.
          In addition, one out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glands</ENAMEX> sampled had a lesion
          with the appearance of a ductal carcinoma 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (focal necrosis, marked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atypia</ENAMEX> and abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mitoses</ENAMEX>, placing it in the category
          of 'mammary intraepithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neoplasia</ENAMEX>' by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX>
          naming convention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional one</NUMEX> had an
          invasive carcinoma. Both the 
          in situ and the invasive carcinomas
          were in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> also had
          histologically normal ducts on the same slide, which were
          scored for the analysis. There was no difference in
          staining between the ducts that were proximal to the
          tumor and those that were more distal, and neither were
          there any differences in staining observed between
          histologically normal and hyperplastic ducts in any of
          the samples analyzed (data not shown). Since the focus of
          the present study was on TGF-β expression changes in the
          preneoplastic gland, staining of the tumors was not
          scored for the analysis, but in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases present,
          the staining did not differ significantly from that of
          the surrounding normal-appearing ducts (not shown).
          Assuming that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 250 g</NUMEX> and
          eats <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 g</NUMEX> of chow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, the equivalent human doses to
          those used in this study would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/day tamoxifen, 2 g/day 4-HPR</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 9cRA</TIMEX>. The
          human doses that are currently being used in clinical
          trials are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day for tamoxifen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> g/day for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9cRA</TIMEX>. The different doses
          of tamoxifen and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPR</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> probably
          reflect interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics.
          However, because the efficacious dose for tamoxifen was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times lower in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> than the dose that has
          previously been shown to upregulate TGF-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>
          tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], we looked at the effect of a higher dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, because one study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β may be transiently upregulated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> after administration of tamoxifen, we also looked
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier time</TIMEX> points. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> receiving tamoxifen at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          mg/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per day intragastrically (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day
          for a human) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per day (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day
          for a human) for either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX>, again no
          consistent changes were seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression, using
          either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -CC</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Effect of chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on the histology
          of the mammary gland
          While scoring the immunohistochemical slides, we
          noticed that the mammary histology appeared to be altered
          in rats treated with chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Hematoxylin
          and eosin stained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from the samples after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX>
          of treatment were analyzed by a veterinary pathologist
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAE</ENAMEX>). The mammary glands from tamoxifen-treated rats
          were less developed than those of untreated control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, having fewer tertiary ducts and terminal
          end-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>, and could consistently be identified from a
          blind data set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment, all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> had a significant effect on
          glandular histology, with tamoxifen and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9cRA</TIMEX> showing the
          greatest suppression of ductal development and lobule
          formation, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR showing a relatively mild
          effect.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> biomarkers
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major goal in the field of prevention is the
          identification of surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">biomarkers</ENAMEX> that might rapidly
          predict the effect of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on the primary
          end-point of cancer incidence. There is an extensive
          literature showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> superfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, such as antiestrogens and retinoids, can
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulate TGF</ENAMEX>-β activity in a variety of systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 35</TIMEX>]. This suggested that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> action of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> against breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> could be mediated in part through enhancing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor activity of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β</ENAMEX> system,
          and thus that changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression might serve as
          useful surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">end-point</ENAMEX> biomarkers of chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX>. However, here we used the NMU-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model
          of mammary carcinogenesis to show that the
          chemopreventive effect of tamoxifen and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retinoids</ENAMEX> is
          not associated with any consistent changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          levels, at least as determined immunohistochemically.
        
        
          Comparison with earlier studies
          Most of the previous studies on the regulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs by tamoxifen and retinoids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 17</TIMEX>] have
          been done in tissue culture. Thus, the lack of effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression in the present 
          in vivo study might reflect the
          dependence of the response on contextual cues that are
          only present in the artificial 
          in vitro environment. In one
          previous 
          in vivo study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] all- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> upregulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression in rats, with kinetics and isoform
          selectivity that varied with the target tissue. However,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were vitamin A-deficient, and it is not known
          whether the same effects would be seen in vitamin
          A-replete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, such as were used in the present
          study, or whether the response would vary with the
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoid</ENAMEX> used.
          There are some data that support an effect of
          tamoxifen on upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs 
          in vivo in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three months</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> treatment was shown to cause a consistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in extracellular TGF-β in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX>, when compared with pretreatment biopsies from
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, complex effects of
          tamoxifen on induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the plasma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> have been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. It is
          possible that tamoxifen is only effective in inducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β in the context of a tumor, and not in normal or
          initiated tissue, which was the subject of the present
          study. This issue could be reassessed in preclinical
          models using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to treat established
          proliferative intraepithelial neoplasia. However, for
          ease of tissue acquisition, an optimal surrogate
          end-point biomarker in a prevention setting needs to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulated</ENAMEX> in normal or premalignant tissues.
        
        
          Alternative levels of regulation of the bioefficacy
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs
          Interestingly, in cell culture, both tamoxifen and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> have been
          shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 17</TIMEX>] to increase the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          in its biologically active, as opposed to its latent
          form. The current method for discriminating between
          active and latent TGF-β in tissue samples requires the
          use of frozen sections and immunofluorescence techniques,
          which are not practical for routine clinical use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
          As simpler assays become available, however, the issue of
          possible changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β activation status should be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readdressed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retinoids</ENAMEX> can also affect cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs at the level of receptor
          expression and downstream events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]. To date,
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-β receptors</ENAMEX> and downstream signaling
          components such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> have not been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-characterized</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model, but in our
          preliminary analyses we saw no effect of retinoids on
          type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-β</ENAMEX> receptor expression in the
          mammary gland (data not shown). At this time, however, we
          certainly cannot rule out the possibility that tamoxifen
          and retinoids may be having subtle effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          system at levels other than the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          expression.
        
        
          Lack of effect of chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on TGF-β
          expression may have positive implications
          There is considerable evidence to suggest that, at
          late stages in tumorigenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs can actually promote
          the tumorigenic process, particularly if the epithelial
          cells have lost responsiveness to the growth regulatory
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β by this time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 39, 40, 41</TIMEX>]. Thus,
          advanced human tumors show increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43, 44</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs are known to
          suppress the immunosurveillance system, to enhance
          angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and to increase
          drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46, 47, 48</TIMEX>].
          In the colon, loss of the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II TGF-β</ENAMEX> receptor
          occurs at the late adenoma to carcinoma transition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>],
          suggesting that early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premalignant lesions</ENAMEX> retain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> and would be amenable to interventions
          that enhance TGF-β activity. However, while the present
          work was in progress, a study was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] showing
          that loss of the type <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> can already be
          seen in a significant fraction of hyperplasias without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atypia</ENAMEX> in the human breast. Furthermore, loss of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor correlated</ENAMEX> with increased risk of subsequently
          developing invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Thus, unlike in the
          colon, loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β response may be a very early event
          in the development of human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
          Since locally elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β levels may select for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β-resistant cells, and because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs can have
          oncogenic effects on the stroma, it may actually be
          important for the safety profile of chemopreventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to demonstrate that they do not increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          levels in the at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>. For example, tamoxifen
          resistance in a xenograft model of advanced human breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, was recently shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>] to be associated with an
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs and concomitant immunosuppressive
          effects on natural killer cells. In this regard, our
          demonstration that the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">preclinical rat</ENAMEX> model is unaffected by tamoxifen, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9cRA</TIMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR may actually have positive implications,
          because these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are already in clinical use.
        
        
          Limitations of the NMU-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of mammary
          carcinogenesis
          The NMU-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of mammary tumorigenesis is
          widely used for chemoprevention studies and yields rapid
          development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> incidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 18</ENAMEX>]. To do this, the initiating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is given at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early puberty</TIMEX>,
          and the chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is typically given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuously</ENAMEX>, starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week later</TIMEX>. Since sexual
          maturity is achieved at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 11 weeks of age</TIMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, this means that the chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is given
          during a period of active development of the mammary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gland</ENAMEX>.
          In the present study we observed that the histology of
          the tamoxifen-treated mammary gland differed
          significantly from control glands when examined after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of tamoxifen treatment. Specifically, there were
          fewer terminal end-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> and less tertiary branching,
          which are indicative of a delay or arrest in normal
          mammary development. This is consistent with the known
          requirement for estrogen for proper mammary development [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>]. We saw a lesser effect with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HPR, although this
          type of phenomenon has also been described in the
          literature for retinoids [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Thus, part of the
          chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and retinoids
          in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> may be due to a generalized decrease in
          ductal development. Because chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are
          unlikely to be given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> during the pubertal
          period, this form of preclinical model may not accurately
          reflect the degree of chemopreventive benefit that could
          be achieved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Although the accelerated time
          course and high penetrance of disease reduces the costs
          of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, it may be advisable to confirm efficacy of
          promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in a model that delays application of
          the chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> until the mammary gland is
          fully developed.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have shown that treatment of rats with tamoxifen or
        retinoids results in effective chemoprevention of mammary
        tumorigenesis, without any detectable effect on local
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs. Although we cannot rule out more
        subtle effects on TGF-β activity, such as the activation of
        latent forms, the data suggest that the underlying
        molecular mechanism of chemoprevention by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> does
        not involve increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression. This agrees with
        
        in vitro work showing that blockade
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β signalling did not abrogate the growth inhibitory
        effect of tamoxifen on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Given the
        very limited breast tissue available in clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprevention</ENAMEX> trials, we do not recommend testing for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-βs as surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">end-point</ENAMEX> biomarkers at this time.
