        In skeletal muscle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dihydropyridine receptor</ENAMEX> (DHPR)
        consists of Î± 
        1S , Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´, Î² 
        1a and Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current and serves as the
        voltage sensor for excitation-contraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) coupling. In
        the latter process, the movement of electrical charges in
        the Î± 
        1S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> promotes a conformational
        change that opens the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ryanodine</ENAMEX> receptor type-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RyR1</NUMEX>) in
        the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX>) leading to an
        increase in cytosolic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The functional
        interactions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> subunits necessary for
        opening the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> are only partially known. Further,
        the interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> subunits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RyR1</ENAMEX> also are
        incompletely understood. The Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
        contains the basic functional elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, including the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+selectivity,
        voltage-dependent gating, and sensitivity to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dihydropyridines</ENAMEX>. The cytoplasmic loop between repeats II
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> of the Î± 
        1S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit interacts</ENAMEX> closely with RyR1
        and is an important determinant of skeletal type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        coupling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasmic loop between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">repeats I and II of the</ENAMEX> Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit, referred to as the AID [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>],
        binds tightly with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> region on the Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit, referred to as the BID [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Î² subunits are âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 to 65</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> essential for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> assembly and/or membrane targeting, as well as for
        modulation of channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ subunit is a highly glycosylated âˆ¼
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two disulfide</NUMEX>-linked peptides
        encoded by the same gene. Transmembrane topology and
        functional analyses suggest the Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ subunit is composed of a single
        transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail of only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Given this topology, the Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ subunit is most likely to interact
        with the Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and/or the Î³ 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 subunits.</TIMEX> The Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">âˆ¼ 32</ENAMEX> kDa skeletal
        muscle-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> presumptive transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. The transmembrane topology of the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit and the critical binding
        domains are unknown at this time.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling is initiated by voltage-dependent charge
        movements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S4</TIMEX> segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> Î± 
        1S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>, whose expression is
        dependent on the presence of the Î² 
        1a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
        Î² 
        1a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> has also been shown to be
        important in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling, presumably by interaction with
        RyR1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The role of the Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ subunit on skeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling is
        unknown, but in heterologous expression systems it has been
        demonstrated to increase the amount of charge movement [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. The role of the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channel function is of
        particular interest given the discovery of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> Î³
        subunit, Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or 
        stargazin , which is expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and is responsible for the 
        stargazer mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        Subsequently, several other Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit genes</ENAMEX> have been
        identified and shown to be expressed in brain and
        peripheral tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. In the present study we
        examined the role of the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit in L-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        coupling in skeletal myotubes. Absence of the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit slows inactivation and
        produces a depolarizing shift in the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> vs. voltage curve, in agreement with results
        from an independently produced Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> knockout mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. However, absence
        of Î³ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> does not affect the voltage dependence
        or the magnitude of charge movements and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients.
        Overall, the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit appears to promote inhibition
        of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channel function of the skeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX>. While
        this subunit is clearly non-essential for activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and for triggering skeletal-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coupling</ENAMEX>, Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> appears to specifically modulate the
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channel function of the skeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX>.

          Inactivation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DHPR Î³ 1subunit</ENAMEX> by gene

          Gene targeting was used to replace the entire coding

          expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> subunits are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1D</ENAMEX>. The
          amount of the Î³

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null samples as a function of total
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was determined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          membrane preparations. These data indicate that the
          amount of Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression in membranes from Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null muscle was not detectable above
          background (no primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>) as expected from the
          fact that the entire gene was deleted. In membranes
          isolated from the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the level of expression of
          the Î³

          for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent determinations,
          consistent with what might be expected from the loss of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele. Whether there is compensation by increased
          expression of other Î³ subunits such as the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and Î³

          alteration of the amount of the other subunits remains to
          be determined in the future.

          We examined the impact of the Î³

          using electrophysiological techniques in primary cultures

          depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mV. Current traces for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> voltage steps are
          shown for clarity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> cell types displayed the
          slow, high-voltage activated L-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current typical
          of skeletal myotubes. When the holding potential was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX>
          mV, we also observed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current, which was
          seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of the cells tested (data not
          shown). Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductance</ENAMEX> vs. voltage curves were computed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Bfor the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cell types. The sigmoidal lines
          correspond to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> fit to the population mean
          while parameters fitted to each cell are shown in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. These data show that the maximum conductance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , for both the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells are significantly larger
          (p<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>) than the values for control cells. However,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-activation potential (V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> ) and the steepness of the curve
          (factor k) were not significantly different (see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, full or partial elimination of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit produced a significant
          increase in the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current density without a change in
          the voltage-dependence of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductance.
          At intermediate potentials such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> mV (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A),
          the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current of Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells inactivated more slowly
          than that of control cells. To examine changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>, we used the paired-pulse protocol shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, which measured the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current not inactivated
          by the pre-pulse. It has been shown that inactivation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skeletal L</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channels approaches steady-state
          extremely slowly, on the time scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. However, for comparative purposes and to be
          consistent with previous measurements in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channels
          lacking Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 22</TIMEX>], we chose a much shorter
          protocol. Cells were held at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV, then stepped to a
          series of depolarizing (pre-pulse) voltages for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> s to
          promote inactivation, then stepped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-50</NUMEX> mV for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ms
          to close non-inactivated channels. The non-inactivated Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current was measured during a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-ms test pulse to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mV</ENAMEX>. In control cells, there was almost complete
          inactivation of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current when the pre-pulse
          potential was in the positive range. This can be seen by
          comparing the amplitude of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current during the
          test pulse in traces <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, corresponding to
          pre-pulse potentials to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-70</NUMEX> mV, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> mV, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+60</NUMEX> mV,
          respectively. In contrast, Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells showed less inactivation
          during the pre-pulse, and thus a significantly larger Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current during the test pulse. Furthermore, pre-pulse
          potentials larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mV</ENAMEX> did not promote additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>, which can be seen by comparing traces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Bshows the maximum
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current during the test pulse plotted as a function
          of the pre-pulse potential. In control cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> was complete when the pre-pulse potential
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above +30 mV</NUMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pA/pF</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-70</NUMEX> mV vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.2</NUMEX> Â±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">0.2 pA/pF</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+70</NUMEX> mV, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> cells). In Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells, inactivation reached a
          plateau when the pre-pulse potential was more positive
          than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">+20 mV</NUMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pA/pF</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-70</NUMEX> mV vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.2</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pA/pF</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+70</NUMEX> mV, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cells). Incomplete inactivation
          was also seen in Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het cells, although this was less
          pronounced than in Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells. Since the pre-pulse was
          not sufficiently long for inactivation to reach
          steady-state, we are not certain whether the observed
          incomplete inactivation reflects a component of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current that inactivates
          extremely slowly or a "truly" non-inactivating component.
          To compare the voltage-dependence of the inactivation
          produced by the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5-second</TIMEX> pre-pulse, the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
          during the test pulse was normalized and fit to the
          Boltzmann equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). The curves for Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells showed a significant
          (p<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>) shift to more positive potentials compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cells. The same conclusion was reached by
          comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> parameters of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Since control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> had a more negative half
          inactivation potential, the higher Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductance of Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2could
          be explained by a larger steady-state inactivation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control Ca</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-40</NUMEX> mV holding potential. To
          determine if this was the case, we measured the Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductance during the pre-pulse for the same cells
          analyzed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>,C. The pre-pulse was delivered from a
          holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV, and therefore the pre-pulse
          current should be less contaminated by steady-state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>. G 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> at the peak of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
          during the pre-pulse was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pS/pF</ENAMEX> for controls, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â± 18 pS/pF</ENAMEX> Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pS/pF</ENAMEX> for Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells with t-test statistical
          significance for controls vs. Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.034</NUMEX> and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX> vs. Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.064</NUMEX>. Thus the
          higher Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductance of Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells persisted at the more
          negative holding potential. These Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductances were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> higher than those at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-40</NUMEX> mV holding
          potential reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The additional current
          could have been contributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (not
          shown), which are available at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV holding
          potential but are inactivated at the more positive
          holding potential. Also, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> was highly variable (see above), this could
          explain the higher p values compared to those reported in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. In summary, decreasing the amount of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or eliminating it
          completely resulted in myotubes with a higher Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current density, a similar voltage-dependence of
          activation, and a reduced rate of inactivation. These
          results, with the exception of the change in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>, are in remarkable agreement with those obtained
          when L-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channel subunits are coexpressed without
          the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit in heterologous cells (see
          below). They also are similar to results obtained
          elsewhere in Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null myotubes using a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-second</TIMEX>
          pre-pulse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, the incomplete inactivation
          of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current resembles that
          observed in ts <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A201 cells expressing DHPRs</ENAMEX> specifically
          lacking Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and using a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-second</TIMEX> inactivation
          protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          The effect of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current kinetics has
          been somewhat confusing until now, because it has not
          been possible to examine its role using homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> and a homologous expression system. In amphibian
          oocytes, Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was assayed in a complex with Î± 
          1C , Î² 
          1a and Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
          found Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> produced a slight decrease in Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current density, no change in activation kinetics and a
          positive shift in the peak Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current vs. voltage
          curve. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HEK293</NUMEX> cells using the same subunit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> did not alter the kinetics
          or density of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+currents [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. However, in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HEK293</NUMEX> cells, the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit increased the rate of Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+channel inactivation and produced a large
          hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]. The results obtained here in skeletal muscle
          demonstrate that absence of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit increases Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>, decreases the inactivation rate, and shifts the
          voltage-dependence of inactivation in the depolarizing
          direction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freise et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] showed that the increase
          in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current was not a result of changes in single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> conductance and suggested the effects were due to
          changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> open probability. However, this
          remains to be tested directly. Expression of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> subunit in BHK cells expressing Î± 
          1A , Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ and Î² 
          1a also shifts the voltage-dependence
          of inactivation âˆ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¼ 7 mV</NUMEX> in the hyperpolarizing direction [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>]. In summary, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Î³ subunits that have been
          characterized to date, namely Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the homologous skeletal myotube
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> described here and Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> described above in heterologous BHK
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], appear to be inhibitory. In each case, the
          presence of Î³ results in fewer Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> available
          for activation.
        
        
          Absence of changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling voltage
          sensor of Î³ 1nullmyotubes
          The impact of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null mutation on myotube <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling
          was inferred from intramembrane charge movements, the
          bulk of which have been shown to originate from the DHPR
          voltage sensor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>]. Additionally, we measured Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients evoked by voltage (i.e., by the movement of
          the voltage sensor) and compared these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of data.
          To measure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> charge movements and to separate these
          charge movements from those produced by other
          voltage-gated channels, a) ionic currents were blocked;
          b) the linear component of the cell capacity was
          subtracted using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/4</ENAMEX> procedure and by analog
          compensation; and c) we used a pulse protocol that
          eliminated the immobilization-sensitive charge movements
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">voltage-gated Na</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and presumably also from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Previous studies in dysgenic (Î± 
          1S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX>) myotubes transfected with Î± 
          1S showed that the pulse protocol and
          the internal and external <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> used here (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>) detected charge movements of a
          magnitude <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 8</TIMEX> fold larger than those present in
          non-transfected dysgenic myotubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Thus we are
          confident that the technique adequately measures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramembrane</ENAMEX> charge movements in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> voltage sensors
          present in the plasma membrane. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Ashows
          "gating-type" currents produced by charge movements in
          response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> step voltages delivered to each cell
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+70</NUMEX> mV). Charge movements did not occur at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mV in any of the cell types. Traces at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> mV and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+70</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mV</ENAMEX> show a transient current at the onset of the voltage
          step, the ON charge, and an equal inverted current at the
          end of the voltage step, the OFF charge. The
          voltage-dependence of the OFF charge estimated by
          integration is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B. The OFF transient was
          usually less contaminated by ionic current than the ON
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transient</ENAMEX>, and for that reason it provides a better
          estimate of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> charge. The main contaminant
          of the ON transient was a non-linear outward current,
          presumably a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that was not always completely
          blocked by the pipette solution. The OFF charge increased
          in a sigmoidal fashion and saturated at potentials more
          positive than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+60</NUMEX> mV in all cases. These data were
          adequately fit by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> equation shown by the
          lines. We found that the fitted maximum charge (Q 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> ) expressed by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cell types
          was âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pF</ENAMEX>, in agreement with previous determinations
          in normal myotubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, Boltzmann
          parameters determined for each cell and then averaged
          were not significantly different in any of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two-by-two</NUMEX>
          comparisons between control, Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> het or Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In summary,
          the magnitude of intramembrane charge movements and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">voltage</ENAMEX> dependence were unaltered by partial or complete
          removal of the Î³ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 subunit.</TIMEX> Furthermore, in agreement
          with previous data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], no additional charges moved
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pulses</ENAMEX> were delivered from a holding potential of
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> mV (data not shown). Thus, failure to detect changes
          in the charge vs. voltage characteristics of Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null myotubes compared to controls
          cannot be explained by charge movements in the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null myotubes occurring at
          potentials more negative than the chosen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV holding
          potential.
          Absence of alterations in the voltage dependence of
          charge movement in the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells should also be reflected
          in the voltage-dependence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients. Changes in
          intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+were measured using confocal line-scan
          imaging of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluo-4</ENAMEX> fluorescence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Ashows a line-scan
          image of a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transient stimulated by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ms
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+90</NUMEX> mV from a holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mV</ENAMEX> in each cell type. The scan direction was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perpendicular</ENAMEX> to the long axis of the myotube in a region
          selected on the basis of a low resting fluorescence and a
          high stimulated fluorescence (red/yellow color). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          traces on top of each image correspond to the time course
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluo-4 fluorescence</ENAMEX> averaged across the entire
          line-scan at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> mV, which is close to the threshold, and
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+90</NUMEX> mV, which produced the maximum Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transient.
          Increase in cytosolic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+started at the onset of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> and peaked âˆ¼ <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 ms later in the three</TIMEX>
          cell types. For all cells, the peak fluorescence change
          for the depolarization to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+90</NUMEX> mV was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3</NUMEX> Î”F/Fo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
          which is equivalent to ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times the resting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. The relatively long recovery time following
          the depolarization is due to the low Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+buffering power
          of the internal recording <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and is in agreement
          with previous studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 30</TIMEX>]. The voltage dependence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”F/Fo</ENAMEX> measured at the peak of the transient is shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B. All curves had the same profile which
          consisted of a threshold for peak Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> mV,
          an increase in peak Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+with pulse potential from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> mV
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> mV and a plateau at more positive potentials.
          Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two-by-two</NUMEX> comparisons of Boltzmann
          parameters fitted to each cell did not reveal
          statistically significant differences (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summary</ENAMEX>, the voltage-dependence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients and
          the maximum cytosolic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration during the
          transient were not significantly affected by partial or
          total absence of the Î³ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 subunit.</TIMEX> However, we cannot rule out
          changes in the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR Ca</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release since this
          measurement requires an entirely different internal
          solution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. A recent report indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">SR Ca</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release rate is slightly higher in Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null myotubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> subunits in voltage sensing and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling
          The Î± 
          1S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pore</ENAMEX> subunit of the skeletal DHPR
          is the main determinant of charge movements and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          coupling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 27, 28</ENAMEX>]. However, other subunits of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> are critical modulators of both functions. In
          heterologous expression systems, the Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -Î´ subunit was shown to affect the
          rate of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current inactivation and charge movement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immobilization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Studies investigating the role of
          the Î² subunit on charge movement vary with the expression
          system used. In amphibian oocytes, Î² subunits increase
          the coupling between charge movements and channel opening
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. We have shown in skeletal muscle cells lacking
          the Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit that reintroduction of
          variants of Î² 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> has little effect on either charge
          movement or the kinetics of activation of the expressed
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. However, the carboxyl terminus of Î²1a
          is an important determinant of the efficiency of the
          coupling between charge movement and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          In contrast to these results, earlier studies in which
          similar Î² subunits were co-expressed with Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunits in oocytes indicated Î²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> had major effects on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current density and
          gating kinetics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>]. While the reason for these
          discrepancies is unknown, they highlight the fact that in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle, the gating characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> might be controlled by interactions beyond
          those taking place among subunits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX>. For
          example, a region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RyR1</ENAMEX> has been shown to be essential
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> is critical for skeletal DHPR function and is
          unlikely to occur in heterologous expression systems.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The ability of the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit to selectively modulate the
        pore function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> without modulation of charge
        movements or the voltage dependence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients is
        unique, especially since other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPR</ENAMEX> subunits participate in
        both functions. In all likelihood, the charge movement
        protocol failed to detect gating currents responsible for
        opening the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, which are quite small and are
        only resolved for depolarizations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>200</NUMEX> ms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] compared
        to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ms used here (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). A possible shift in the
        voltage-dependence of these charges recruited by long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarizations</ENAMEX> would be consistent with the shift in Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current inactivation and remains to be resolved in Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null myotubes. However, the protocol
        accurately measures the immobilization-resistant charge
        movements that are known to be required for skeletal-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> coupling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 40</TIMEX>]. Therefore, the Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> subunit is unlikely to play a critical
        role in the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR Ca</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release, in agreement
        with a recent report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. However, shifts in voltage
        dependence below the limit of resolution (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        Methods) and effects on charge movement and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> cannot be completely ruled out. The Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> provide a unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> to understand the function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myotubes</ENAMEX> in molecular detail.

          Gene targeting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteriophage</ENAMEX> clones containing portions of the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene were isolated from a mouse
          129Sv <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomic library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#946305</NUMEX>).
          To inactivate the Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX> kb 
          Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HI</ENAMEX>/ 
          Xho I fragment upstream of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          was subcloned into a multiple cloning site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Herpes virus</ENAMEX> TK gene that
          was in pBluescript (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> kb

          Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene was cloned into a site between
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TK genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aii). Thus,
          the targeting vector contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.4 kb</NUMEX> of identity with the
          native Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene 5</ENAMEX>', and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> kb of identity <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          of the 
          neo cassette, respectively. The
          targeting vector also contains the HSV TK gene to allow
          for negative selection of non-recombinants. A unique 
          Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> restriction site was used to
          linearize the plasmid prior to its introduction into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mouse ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by electroporation. The Î³ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 exons</NUMEX>, and correct
          targeting results in the deletion of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exons, which
          will inactivate the gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aiii). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Probe 2</ENAMEX> was used
          for identification of targeted clones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of the

          also were targeted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end. These were expanded and
          used to produce germline chimeras. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice homozygous</ENAMEX> for
          the targeted allele were viable, with no apparent

          Electrophysiological measurements
          Whole-cell recordings were performed as described

          with the pipette solution. Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+currents were measured
          from a holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-40</NUMEX> mV. Test pulses of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ms</ENAMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mV increments ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-40</NUMEX> mV to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+60</NUMEX> mV. Ca

          Voltage was stepped from a holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV to

          to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> mV holding potential. Subtraction of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> component was assisted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/4</ENAMEX> procedure
          following the pulse paradigm listed above. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/4</ENAMEX> pulses
          were separated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 ms</TIMEX> and had a duration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ms.
          Previous studies showed this choice of pulse protocol and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> and external solutions resulted in

          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transient measurements
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients were measured using a confocal
          microscope in line-scan mode as described previously [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47, 48</TIMEX>]. Cells were loaded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM fluo-4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fluo-4</ENAMEX>

          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 40</TIMEX> min at room temperature. Stocks of fluo-4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>) were made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and stored frozen. All
          experiments were performed at room temperature. Cells
          were viewed with an inverted Olympus microscope with a
          20X objective (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.A.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluoview</ENAMEX> confocal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attachment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus, Melville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX> nm spectrum
          line necessary for fluo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> excitation was provided by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          mW argon laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">attenuated</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> with neutral density
          filters. The fluorescence intensity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, was calculated by
          densitometric scanning of line-scan images and was
          averaged over the entire width of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The
          background fluorescence intensity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fo</ENAMEX>) was averaged in
          the same manner from areas of the same image prior to the

          fluorescence, was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ¼ 0.1</NUMEX> Î”F/Fo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. That is, we could
          detect a âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> change above the cell resting

          For each cell, or for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> average, the

          were fitted according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boltzmann equation A = A</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1/2</ENAMEX> is the potential at which A = A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">max /2</ENAMEX>; and k is the slope factor. For
          a fit of steady-state inactivation, the term (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>-V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> ) in the equation above was
          replaced by (V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1/2 -V</ENAMEX>). Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conductance for each
          cell was computed from the extrapolated reversal
          potential and the maximal Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+current at each voltage.
          In all figures, the symbols and error bars correspond to
          the population mean Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX>. The curves correspond to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> fit of the mean. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student t</ENAMEX>-tests
          reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> tests were conducted
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> parameters of control, Î³

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> null cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> (equality of means) was not rejected at a
          level of significance p<<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> except in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases
          also identified by t-tests, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> and V 
          1/2 inactivation. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>test, which
          formally tests for the difference between the variances
          of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, was used to determine which
          of the fitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> parameters (A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> , k) had the largest variance, and
          thus the largest experimental error. The ranking order in
          variance error was V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> >A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max >k. Furthermore</ENAMEX>, the error in V
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1/2</ENAMEX> was the largest for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fluorescence</ENAMEX> measurement and the smallest for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">conductance</ENAMEX> measurement. This result was expected since
          the size of the voltage step used in the V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mV for
          conductance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mV for charge movements, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mV for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. The number of voltage steps in fluorescence
          measurements was kept to a minimum to avoid rundown of
          the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transient due to photobleaching. The limit of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> of V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> , the parameter with the largest
          error, was estimated with a z-test which formally tests
          for the difference between the mean of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and a
          hypothetical mean. We determined the smallest difference
          between a experimental and a hypothesized V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> resolvable at a level of
          statistical confidence p<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>. In the calculations, we
          used the data with the largest V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> variance for each measurement
          (conductance, charge movement and fluorescence). Also, we
          assumed a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.D.</ENAMEX> equal to the experimental
          S.D. The estimated limits of statistical resolution were
          âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX> mV for conductance, âˆ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¼ 6.5 mV</NUMEX> for charge movements,
          and âˆ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¼ 8.5 mV</NUMEX> for fluorescence measurements. Thus, a
          difference in population mean V 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> of less than the indicated limit
          would not be statistically significant, given the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> and the number of determinations of the present
          study. Statistical analyses were performed with
          Analyse-it software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leeds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>)
