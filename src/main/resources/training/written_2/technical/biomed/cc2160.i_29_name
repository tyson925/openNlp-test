        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypokalemia</ENAMEX> and many types of electrocardiographic (ECG)
        abnormality are observed during the acute phase of
        subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Among ECG
        abnormalities, a prolongation of the QT interval,
        especially when associated with hypokalemia, deserves
        particular attention because it is frequently observed in
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who develop life-threatening ventricular
        arrhythmias such as tor-sades de pointes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 4</NUMEX> ] .
        However, the pathogeneses of these abnormalities during the
        acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> have not yet been fully
        investigated.
        It is commonly believed that hypokalemia identified
        during the acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> is caused by a catecholamine
        surge following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In healthy male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] demonstrated that serum infused
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenaline</ENAMEX> (epinephrine) caused excessive activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sodium/potassium-ATPase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K +-ATPase; Na +/K</ENAMEX> +pump) as
        a result of β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor stimulation; this
        resulted in trafficking of potassium ions from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> to intracellu-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lar</NUMEX> spaces, leading to a
        decrease in serum potassium levels.
        Recent work showed that there were some relationships
        between serum catecholamine levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> intervals during
        the acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 6</NUMEX> ] . However, one cannot refute
        the possibility that the catecholamine surge may influence
        the QT interval indirectly via hypokalemia, because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypokalemia</ENAMEX> (as well as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia)
        can cause a prolongation in the QT interval [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        .
        In a previous preliminary study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , we suggested
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may be more prone than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to develop both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypokalemia</ENAMEX> and prolongation in the corrected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> (QTc)
        interval on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>. In the present
        prospective study, we assessed various possible risk
        factors for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation that is observed in SAH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in order to examine independent risk factors by
        means of multivariate analysis.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          We prospectively studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> to the National Defense
          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Hospital</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January 1997 and April</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>; mean age on admission was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59.1</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11.8 years</TIMEX>, with
          a range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-82 years</TIMEX>. Neurologic condition on admission
          was evaluated according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> and Kosnik
          classification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> was assessed
          according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s classification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The
          exclusion criteria included endocrino-logic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, renal failure, previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> or
          intracerebral hemorrhage, young <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 years</TIMEX>),
          pregnancy, pacemaker rhythm, or taking any of the
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>: digitalis, quinidine, procainamide,
          disopyramide, and diuretics. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had brain
          computed tomography studies compatible with their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> underwent a cerebral angiogram to
          identify a ruptured aneurysm, except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> were so severe that there was no indication for
          cerebral angiography. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with traumatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> or SAH
          of unknown origin, despite assessment by cerebral
          angiography, were also excluded from the study. Informed
          consent was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and/or their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guardians</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          Standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> was performed immediately after
          admission. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QT</ENAMEX> intervals were manually
          measured for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> leads of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> with the assessor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded</ENAMEX> to the name and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The QT
          intervals were measured from the beginning of the QRS
          complex to the visual return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> wave to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoelectric</ENAMEX> line, and were corrected for heart rate using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bazett</ENAMEX> formula: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">QT</ENAMEX>/(square root of RR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interval</ENAMEX>). The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> interval was calculated from all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> intervals measured. The intraob-server coefficient of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> and the interobserver coefficient of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were obtained from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the same time as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX>, and serum levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodium</ENAMEX>, potassium, calcium, adrenaline, noradrenaline
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">norepinephrine</NUMEX>), dopamine, antidiuretic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> were measured.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          In order to identify potential risk factors for severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation, univariate analysis was conducted using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">χ 2test</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX> test. The
          model was reduced using manual back and forth procedure,
          with variable selection based on the statistical
          significance of the estimates ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX>). Multiple logistic
          regression analysis was then performed to identify
          independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s correlation coefficient was used to assess the
          correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc
          intervals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are expressed as means ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          statistically significant and all analyses were performed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">StatView Version 5.0</ENAMEX> statistical package (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Univariate analysis
          Univariate analyses demonstrated that there were
          significant relationships between the category of QTc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> and patient sex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Significant
          relationships were also identified between category of
          QTc interval and the serum concentrations of potassium,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Severe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">470 ms</ENAMEX> or more; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>) was more frequent among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">female SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.1%</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0004</NUMEX>) than among male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe QTc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolongation</ENAMEX> had lower serum potassium levels (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.21</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) than did patients
          with a QTc interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 470</NUMEX> ms (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.63</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mmol/l</ENAMEX>). Hypokalemia was defined as serum potassium level
          below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mmol<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/l. Severe QTc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prolongation</ENAMEX> was more
          frequently found among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypokalemia
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58.8%</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) than among SAH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with normokalemia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.4%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation also had lower serum calcium levels
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.29 ± 0.52</NUMEX> mmol/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX>) as compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a QTc interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 470</NUMEX> ms (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.52</NUMEX> ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.39 mmol/l</ENAMEX>). The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum glucose</ENAMEX> was
          significantly higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a severely
          prolonged QTc interval (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">207 ± 56 mg/dl</ENAMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>) as compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a QTc interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 470</NUMEX> ms (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX> ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">49 mg/dl</ENAMEX>).
          There was, however, no relation between category of
          QTc interval and patient age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosnik</ENAMEX> grade,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s classification for computed tomography, site of
          ruptured aneurysm, or the serum concentration of sodium,
          adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, or antidiuretic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>. There were significant inverse correlations
          between serum potassium level and serum concentrations of
          adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and antidiuretic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-0.712, -0.573, -0.432, -0.442,</ENAMEX>
          respectively). Furthermore, female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> levels (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.36 ± 0.50</NUMEX> mmol/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>) than did male SAH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.65 ± 0.36</NUMEX> mmol/l).
        
        
          Multivariate analysis
          The multivariate analyses showed that female sex and
          hypokalemia were independent risk factors for severe QTc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolongation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis,
          the serum potassium level was considered a continuous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> (analysis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). An increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mmol/l</ENAMEX>
          in serum potassium was associated with a relative risk of
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.13</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) for severe QTc
          prolongation, while female sex was associated with a
          relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.69</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.27</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.73</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>) as compared with male
          sex. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> analysis (analysis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) revealed
          that hypokalemia was associated with a relative risk of
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.53</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.79</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.50</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.002</NUMEX>) as compared with
          normokalemia, while the relative risk with female sex was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.45</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.78</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) as compared with male
          sex.
        
        
          Correlation between serum potassium level and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corrected QT</ENAMEX> interval
          There was a significant inverse correlation between
          serum potassium level and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> interval (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s
          correlation coefficient 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.439</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a) among all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of sex
          on the correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc
          interval. Among female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, there was a
          significant inverse correlation between serum potassium
          levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> interval ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.474</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c). On the
          other hand, there was no significant correlation between
          the serum potassium levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> intervals ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.009</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b) among male SAH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present findings suggest that female sex and
        hypokalemia are independent risk factors for severe QTc
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolongation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>. Recent clinical
        observations and experimental data indicate sex-specific
        differences in various ECG abnormalities. Several 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo experimental studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] have shown that female sex is a strong risk factor for
        drug-induced long QT interval and cardiac arrhythmias. In a
        study of healthy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stramba-Badiale</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> had a longer QTc
        interval than did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, recent evidence
        suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are more prone than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to develop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">torsades de pointes</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that prolong cardiac repolarization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 16</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, little is known about the mechanism responsible
        for these sex related differences in the QTc interval or in
        the occurrence of torsades de pointes. Several studies have
        indicated that sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> play an important role in these
        sex differences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drici</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] showed that
        ovariectomy resulted in a shorter QT interval, and high
        doses of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> lengthened the QT interval. In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haseroth</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> replacement therapy significantly prolonged QTc
        intervals in post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. However, several other
        studies reported that sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> did not affect the QT
        interval in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Various factors may
        be involved in the sex-specific difference in ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repolarization</ENAMEX> (e.g. sex-related differences in cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ionic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>). Female rabbit ventricular myocytes had a
        significantly slower rapid component of the delayed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectifier</ENAMEX> than did male cells, which might contribute to
        the gender difference in the QT interval [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In fact,
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that prolong the QTc interval have been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> cardiac potassium channels, especially the rapid
        component of the delayed rectifier [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> are more susceptible to hypokalemia, especially
        that due to diuretics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] or SAH [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Considering
        that hypokalemia causes a prolongation in the QTc interval
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8 9 25</NUMEX> ] , the sex-specific difference in ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repolarization</ENAMEX> described above might result from the
        sex-related difference in serum potassium levels. It is
        interesting that serum potassium levels did not affect QTc
        interval among male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, whereas there was a
        significant inverse correlation between serum potassium
        levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> interval among female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        present study.
        One mechanism that may account for this sex-specific
        difference in serum potassium levels is a sex-specific
        difference in the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K +-ATPase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K</ENAMEX>
        +pump), as reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasker</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K</ENAMEX> +-ATPase activity in red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood cells</ENAMEX> was higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, thus
        leading to a sex-specific difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K</ENAMEX> +balance
        in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Another
        possible explanation is a difference in the total
        exchangeable body potassium. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinfeld</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        demonstrated that elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were more vulnerable to
        hypokalemia, and indicated that this was possibly due to
        age- and sex-associated differences in body mass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, which might result in a physiologically low
        total exchangeable body potassium.
        An inverse correlation between the serum catecholamines
        and potassium levels suggests that a catecholamine surge
        following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> plays an important role in the pathogenesis
        of hypokalemia during the acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>. Recent
        evidence suggested that adrenaline-induced hypokalemia
        resulted from stimulation of a β-adrenoceptor linked to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane Na +/K +-ATPase</ENAMEX>, causing potassium influx [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 28</ENAMEX> ]
        . On the other hand, there was no correlation between serum
        cate-cholamine level and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> interval in the present
        series. These findings indicate that a catecholamine surge
        following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> does not play a direct role in the
        pathogenesis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] showed that serum
        infused-adrenaline caused not only hypokalemia but also a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolongation</ENAMEX> in the QTc interval in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>,
        which appears to be highly consistent with the present
        findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>.
        The therapeutic implications of the present findings are
        clear. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> is hospitalized during the
        acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>, as a rule potassium-free intravenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluids</ENAMEX> should not be used as initial fluid therapy,
        particularly in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, careful ECG
        monitoring is needed to detect critical cardiac arrhythmias
        as soon as possible, and avoidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that prolong
        ventricular repolarization (quinidine, procainamide, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disopyramide</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>, especially female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, is mandatory. The findings reported here also
        suggest an important new direction for further research,
        focusing on the detection of critical cardiac arrhythmias
        in order to prevent sudden death at an early stage in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>.
        There are some limits to the conclusions that can be
        drawn from the present study. The study lacks data on ECG
        changes after admission in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, which can only
        be assessed by means of continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Holter</ENAMEX> monitoring. It
        was therefore impossible to consider the influence of QTc
        prolongation on the occurrence of critical cardiac
        arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Further studies
        are required to investigate the pathophysiologic basis for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> prolongation and to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> changes after
        admission in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>.
