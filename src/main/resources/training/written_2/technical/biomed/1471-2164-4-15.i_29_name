        Human chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> is associated with genomic
        disorders involving deletions, duplications and
        triplications of different intervals in this region. The
        formation of these cytogenetic abnormalities is mediated by
        low-copy repeated sequences, or duplicons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . High
        sequence homology between copies presumably facilitates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mispairing</ENAMEX> and unequal recombination events in meiosis.
        Interstitial deletion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q11-q13</TIMEX> results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prader</ENAMEX>-Willi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS; MIM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 176270</NUMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Angelman syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>; MIM
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 105830</NUMEX>), when deletions occur on the paternally-derived
        or maternally-derived homolog, respectively (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;
        reviewed in refs. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] ). Interstitial duplication of
        the same interval has been found in cases of autism, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest a higher risk for autism with maternal
        compared to paternal duplications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        is the most frequently involved chromosome in cases of
        autism with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">supernumerary marker chromosomes</ENAMEX>. 15q-derived
        markers are inverted, duplicated and pseudodicentric
        structures and are known as inv dup(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) or idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>). Small
        markers which do not contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX> deletion interval
        are associated with a normal phenotype [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idic</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) duplications are typically associated with a more
        severe autistic phenotype than that seen in cases of
        interstitial duplication [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . The
        increased severity may be due to the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        additional copies of this region, however these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX> also extend significantly farther
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomerically</ENAMEX> and therefore contain more duplicated genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ldic</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) markers also vary in the location of the distal
        breakpoint, depending on which duplicon sequence mediated
        the rearrangement. Interstitial triplications have also
        been described, and these tend to utilize variable distal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> common to idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Triplications are associated with a phenotype analogous to
        that for idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) when maternally-derived [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 12 13</ENAMEX> ] .
        Several functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplicons</ENAMEX> have been described, and
        these may be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes. There are two
        proximal breakpoints (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1 and BP2</TIMEX>) that define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX> deletion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The common distal breakpoint is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">termed BP3</ENAMEX> and has a bipartite structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . The
        BP2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP3</ENAMEX> duplicons span <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> kb and contain
        at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> expressed sequences. One prominent example
        is the 
        HERC2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hect</ENAMEX> domain and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rcc1</ENAMEX> domain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein 2</ENAMEX>) gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> 
        HERC2 copies have been identified on
        chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 16</TIMEX>, although most map to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX>.
        Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">duplicons</ENAMEX> has been termed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCR15s</TIMEX>, for
        low copy repeats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . These share some sequences in
        common with the large 
        HERC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplicons</ENAMEX>. LCR15s extend only
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> kb individually, but are often present in clusters
        extending to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-60</NUMEX> kb. This class of duplicon has been
        proposed to help mediate rearrangements in idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) markers
        and larger interstitial duplications and triplications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein A2</ENAMEX> ( 
        APBA2 ) was previously mapped to
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and localized to the common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PWS</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>
        deletion region centromeric to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">BP3</NUMEX> and distal to a cluster
        of GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subunit genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This location made 
        APBA2 an attractive positional
        candidate gene for involvement in duplication-associated
        and inherited autism. On this basis we sought to
        characterize 
        APBA2 in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and
        expression. APBA2 has also been termed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mint2</TIMEX>, for
        Munc-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 2</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-11Î²</ENAMEX>. Mint2 functions as a
        neuronal adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that binds to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Munc18</NUMEX>-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biederer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SÃ</ENAMEX>¼dhof have shown that a multiprotein
        complex containing Mint1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">APBA1</NUMEX>) binds to the cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX> of neurexins, which play a critical role in synaptic
        vesicle exocytosis. Mint1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mint2</ENAMEX> can bind directly to
        neurexins via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. Thus the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mint proteins</ENAMEX> serve to anchor Munc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> to the neurexins and
        thereby facilitate exocytosis. We show here that 
        APBA2 actually maps to a more distal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, outside the narrow common interstitial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deletion/duplication</ENAMEX> interval but within the larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idic</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) duplications. We found that a large <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coding exon of 
        APBA2 is duplicated, and these
        transcriptionally inactive copies are located at more
        telomeric sites within the region. The nature of the
        duplication may have implications for the evolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">APBA2/Mint2</ENAMEX> from its other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        We sought to characterize the structure and expression
        of the 
        APBA2 gene, as a prelude to analysis
        of this gene as a possible autism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. We obtained a
        bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">(686I6</ENAMEX>)
        containing genomic sequence of the 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. We also
        obtained yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones covering
        the interval between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of 
        GABRG3 and 
        OCA2 (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">962D11</TIMEX>; contig <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WC-153</ENAMEX>) and to
        which an 
        APBA2 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wl-14097</ENAMEX>) and nearby
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> had been mapped (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">764C6</TIMEX>; contig <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WC-699</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS</ENAMEX> content
        mapping demonstrated that 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> and other markers are
        present within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">686I6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">764C4</ENAMEX> but absent from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> clone covering the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GABRG3-OCA2</ENAMEX> interval (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        Thus, the previous map position appeared to be incorrect.
        Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS marker</ENAMEX> content in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68616</NUMEX> clone, 
        APBA2 maps to a more distal location
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q13</TIMEX>. The revised map position places 
        APBA2 outside of the most narrow
        interstitial duplication interval and the area most
        supported by linkage data but within the larger idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>. Current genomic sequence assemblies now agree
        with this experimentally-determined data.
        To facilitate direct screening of 
        APBA2 , we determined the gene
        structure and developed exon-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays. We
        characterized genomic structure using a combination of
        existing genomic sequence and direct sequencing from BAC
        clone template. 
        APBA2 is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> exons; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        exons are coding and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> exons contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' untranslated
        sequence. All exons are now accurately predicted in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">010363</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> assemblies, while the
        EnsembI <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> lacks the putative first exon. A sequence
        containing this exon has been deposited in GenBank
        (accession: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AY228760</ENAMEX>). Junctions for most exons were
        confirmed by direct sequencing from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP-11 BAC</ENAMEX> 330K3
        template, which also contains the 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. Table
        1itemizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron-exon</ENAMEX> boundary information. Primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-14</ENAMEX>) are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. 
        APBA2 is transcribed towards the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomere</ENAMEX>.
        In the course of analyzing the structure of 
        APBA2 , we noted that a large <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' exon
        containing the initiating methionine codon was present not
        only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 686I6</TIMEX> BAC but also highly homologous to
        sequences from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones with non-overlapping STS
        content. 
        In silico <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS</ENAMEX> content mapping
        revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones containing the
        partial duplications (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these (RP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">clones 602M11</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">122P18</ENAMEX>) also contains a partial
        duplication of a pseudogene containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
        neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nicotinic</ENAMEX> receptor <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î± 7 subunit</NUMEX> ( 
        CHRNA7 ) gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . This
        pseudogene locus maps to a site telomeric to 
        APBA2 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q13</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP-11 438P7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 H8</ENAMEX>) contained the partial 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +CI
        -cotransporter ( 
        SLC12A6 or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KCC3</NUMEX>) gene. The
        duplications include the entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-kb exon and ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-kb</NUMEX> of
        downstream sequence, however this sequence is interrupted
        in the intact locus by an ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kb</NUMEX> non-duplicated interval.
        The first block of homology includes exon <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, ~100 bp</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence 5</ENAMEX>' and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,045 bp 3</NUMEX>' to the exon. Following the
        homology gap, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 3,945</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> of duplicated
        sequence. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 15</NUMEX> kb region in both
        sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BACs</ENAMEX> containing partial 
        APBA2 duplications is highly
        homologous to a region approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 kb</NUMEX> upstream of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presumptive</ENAMEX> first exon of 
        APBA2 . Current sequence assemblies
        show the correct map location for the intact locus and show
        the map location of these dupAPBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~5 Mb</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeric</ENAMEX>.
        BLAST analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BACS</ENAMEX> containing the partial 
        APBA2 duplications revealed
        duplicon-like sequences, based on significant homology to a
        large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> from known duplicons. The largest
        number of similarities detected (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>30</NUMEX>) corresponds to an
        interval of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~15</NUMEX> kb located ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> kb centromeric to the 
        APBA2 duplications. However, there is
        highly significant homology over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~100-kb</NUMEX> of sequence from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">assembly contig NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">035325</ENAMEX> mapping to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q26</TIMEX>, where LCR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        duplicon sequences have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> appear to correspond to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LCR15</NUMEX> class of
        duplicons, based on sequence content. BLAST analysis of
        sequence at the intact locus revealed a similar low copy
        repeat or duplicon-type sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1.3-kb</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 80</NUMEX>
        copies of this sequence are present at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> across the
        genome on every chromosome, and with an apparent clustering
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">telomere</NUMEX> locations. This sequence, while short, does not
        correspond to any of the known chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15q11</NUMEX>-q13
        duplicon sequences, and therefore could represent a novel
        class of such low copy repeats. This sequence has been
        deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AY237156</NUMEX>). It is worth noting that
        the presence of multiple duplicons and repeated sequences
        has significantly complicated genomic sequence assembly for
        this region.
        Since the partial duplications of 
        APBA2 contained the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coding exon
        and the transcription start site(s) for 
        APBA2 have not been characterized, we
        sought to determine whether these copies were
        transcriptionally active. We developed restriction fragment
        length polymorphism (RFLP) assays to detect sequence
        differences discriminating the intact 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> from the partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>. These assays were used following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> or BAC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and cDNA from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and fetal human
        brain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>). Distinct "fingerprint" patterns are
        apparent for the intact locus and the duplications. The
        sequence differences used in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2cthat</NUMEX> distinguish the
        duplications from the intact locus do not distinguish the
        duplications from each other. This distinction was made
        based on 
        in silico analysis of numerous
        sequence differences, clone-sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clone-marker/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content relationships. The pattern in
        cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was identical to that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone 686I6</TIMEX> but not
        either of the two duplications. These data argue that the
        only transcript present in brain corresponds to the intact
        locus, and that the two partial duplications are therefore
        not transcribed.
        Immediately telomeric to 
        APBA2 lies another gene (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIAA0574</TIMEX>;
        see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>), which was initially identified from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> project of large, brain-derived cDNAs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        KIAA0574 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encodes a protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function, and is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> in the opposite orientation relative to 
        APBA2 . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> using the KIAA0574
        predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence detects weak homology (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>
        identity, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> similarity over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>) to a protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">termed X123</ENAMEX>, the gene for which is located in the 9q12.21
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freidrich</ENAMEX>'s ataxia region. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">X123</NUMEX> gene in turn maps
        immediately adjacent to 
        APBA1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alias Mint1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X11Î±</NUMEX>). APBA1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APBA2</ENAMEX> are highly homologous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
        their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> similar, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> identical).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, corresponding to the duplicated exon,
        is only weakly similar (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> similar, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> identical). Thus
        the distinction between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">APBA1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APBA2 proteins</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Despite the
        comparatively weak homology between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KIAA0574</NUMEX> and X123
        predicted peptides, this scenario suggests a clear
        evolutionary relationship between these gene pairs. The
        propensity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> region to undergo rearrangement
        may have played a role in the evolution of this gene
        family.
        The distribution of 
        APBA2 brain expression was determined
        using 
        in situ hybridization and northern
        blotting. Commercial brain northern blots were hybridized
        with a cDNA probe corresponding to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Such a probe
        allows us to discriminate between 
        APBA2 expression and potential signal
        from 
        APBA1 . Northern blotting revealed a
        predominant moderate-abundance transcript of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>-kb widely
        distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord (Figure
        3a). Several smaller transcripts were also seen. A cDNA
        clone for the mouse ortholog of 
        APBA2 was obtained and a similar
        probe was used to test for expression using 
        in situ hybridization to mouse brain
        sections. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3bshows</NUMEX> representative coronal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sagittal</ENAMEX> mouse brain sections. 
        Apba2 demonstrates moderate
        expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse cortical</ENAMEX> and limbic regions including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frontal</ENAMEX>, parietal, and temporal cortex, hippocampus,
        amygdala, thalamus, and cerebellum and lower level
        expression in many other regions summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. A
        developmental expression series illustrating expression
        from embryonic day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E8-E15</ENAMEX>) is shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Early expression in the primitive neural tube
        emerges at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day E10</TIMEX>. 
        Apba2 expression extends throughout
        the neural tube during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days E11 and E12</TIMEX>, but is apparently
        restricted to the primitive brain vesicles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> E13
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E14</TIMEX>. Within the brain, distribution is ubiquitous and
        uniform. In addition to diffuse expression throughout the
        brain, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day E15</TIMEX>, a punctate pattern appears around the
        spinal cord, corresponding to expression within the dorsal
        root ganglia.
        The availability of emerging mouse genomic sequence
        allowed us to examine sequence conservation across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. We submitted human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> web site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www-gsd.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lbl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/vista/</ENAMEX>and homology is plotted and
        shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Murine genomic sequence for exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was not available, and the comparison was made for the
        remainder of the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. We would expect
        coding sequences to be conserved, but regions of non-coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, which could harbour potential functional
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">conserved</NUMEX>) sequences, are of particular interest. Several
        such regions are present within the 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        We have described the mapping of 
        APBA2 to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15q13.1</NUMEX> within a region
        duplicated in idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) marker chromosomes, thus clarifying
        the map position of this gene. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private
        sequence assemblies now depict the correct location for
        this gene, previous published reports indicated that this
        gene mapped proximal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP3</NUMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX> deletion and
        autism-associated interstitial duplication interval [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS</ENAMEX> content mapping with regional clones confirms the
        predicted genomic assemblies and places this gene distal to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BP3 HERC2</NUMEX>-containing breakpoint. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> partial 
        APBA2 copies containing the first
        coding exon and downstream sequence and are located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">~</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Mb</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeric</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15q13.3</NUMEX>. This location contains duplicon-like
        sequences, based on BLAST-detected homology relationships
        to other non-overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones, which contain
        LCR15-inclusive sequences. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> may represent yet
        another functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplicon</ENAMEX>. This suggests the possibility
        of such sequences upstream from 
        APBA2 , most likely corresponding to
        BP3 or in a sequence gap between 
        HERC2 and 
        APBA2 . The existence of a
        duplicon-like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> near 
        APBA2 would most easily explain the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>. The duplicated region corresponded to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        blocks in the intact locus which are joined together in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplication</ENAMEX> copies, perhaps reflecting the original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the intact ancestral locus. Within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7</NUMEX>
        kb gap between homology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, another low-copy repeat
        sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1.3</NUMEX> kb was identified. The pattern of partial
        duplication seen with 
        APBA2 is similar to that of 
        CHRNA7 . The repetitive nature of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has presented significant challenges to genomic
        sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. It is likely that repeated elements
        cause some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> to be poorly represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">coli</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Our interest in this gene was driven
        by its plausibility as a candidate for autism, based upon
        function. The location of 
        APBA2 outside the narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deletion/duplication</ENAMEX> interval makes this gene less
        attractive as a candidate for inherited autism. However,
        overexpression of this gene in idic(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) cases could be
        responsible in part for the increased phenotypic severity
        in those cases compared to interstitial duplication.
        We characterized gene structure for the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and
        expression for both human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        known exons, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of which are shown in the current public
        human genomic sequence assemblies. A putative first exon,
        corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> transcript, maps
        at least <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">74-kb</NUMEX> upstream of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Based on a combination
        of the public and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> assemblies, the 
        APBA2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> unit spans
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>197</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb</ENAMEX>. We provided primer sequences and amplification
        conditions to facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease variant</ENAMEX> discovery
        at this locus.
        
        APBA2 is expressed throughout the
        central nervous system in the adult human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
        developing mouse embryos. The ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>-kb predominant
        transcript is larger than the longest available mRNA
        sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,647 bp</NUMEX>. The difference is most likely due to
        as yet unidentified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' untranslated exons or by use of
        alternative polyadenylation sites. The presence of multiple
        consensus polyadenylation signals both before and after the
        one utilized in this transcript is consistent with the
        latter hypothesis. Additionally, less abundant smaller
        transcripts exist. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data supports the occurrence of
        alternative splicing for this gene. To our knowledge,
        transcriptional initiation site(s) have not been
        characterized for 
        APBA2 . The fact that the partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplication</ENAMEX> copies are not expressed supports the premise
        that the intact locus may not have a transcriptional
        initiation site at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 3</ENAMEX>.
        Genomic sequence corresponding to the mouse ortholog is
        present in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, although sequence upstream
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 3</ENAMEX> is not available. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> comparison of human and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> sequences reveals several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of conserved
        non-coding sequences; these may contain functional elements
        necessary for proper expression.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The 
        APBA2 gene maps to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15q13.1</NUMEX> telomeric
        to 
        HERC2 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP3</TIMEX>. Partial duplications
        of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coding exon are
        present as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies at ~<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Mb</ENAMEX> telomeric in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q13.3</ENAMEX> and are
        not transcribed. The pattern of duplication for 
        APBA2 adds to a complex mosaic
        including many duplicon-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q13</TIMEX>. The
        tendency of this region to undergo rearrangement may bear
        relation to the evolution of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
