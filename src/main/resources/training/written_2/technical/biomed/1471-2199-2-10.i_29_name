        Transcriptional activation is one of the key elements of
        eukaryotic gene expression. A variety of genetic,
        biochemical, and structural studies have revealed many
        mechanistic details of this process [see, for review, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] ]. In some cases, the structural/chemical basis for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/DNA</ENAMEX> complex formation and recruitment of ancillary
        factors that promote transcription have been elucidated.
        Mutational analysis has defined regions of transcription
        factors - even specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues -</ENAMEX> that participate in the
        activation process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most common
        structural features is the acidic activation domain, a
        region with excess negative charge present on many native
        activators as well as artificial ones. These activation
        domains are modular and can be effective when removed from
        one context and transplanted onto other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding
        molecules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        The yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> exploits this modular
        feature of transcriptional activators [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Several
        variants of this general approach have been devised that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">employ DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain and activation domain fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to assess and/or recover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact.
        The exceptional flexibility and efficiency of this system
        propelled it to the forefront of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interaction
        studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . The technology has also been adopted
        for a variety of other applications including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, small-molecule screens, and screens for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> peptide aptamers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        In this study we used the DNA-binding domain of a lexA
        yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid construct to recover short peptides from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> which function as transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX>. A deliberate search for activator peptides
        revealed that, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal peptide fusions to the
        lexA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain had a higher probability of
        activating transcription, sequences inserted within the
        structure of a green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) scaffold
        also functioned as activators. The selected peptide
        activators were strongly biased in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition
        compared to unselected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> peptides. However,
        structural features such as acidity observed in previous
        studies were not absolute requirements for activation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Charge neutral and basic peptide activators arose
        at significant frequencies. A peptide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in length
        was modular, remaining a competent activator when grafted
        into a new context. These results are consistent with the
        recruitment model for transactivation and suggest that
        peptides may act as bridging molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Such short
        peptidic sequences that activate transcription may be
        useful in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery.
      
      
        Results
        
          Construction of lexA binding domain peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">libraries</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> random peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were used in the
          experiments, one that displayed peptides within the green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) structure, the other as
          C-terminal fusions to lexA. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> internal random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was fused to the lexA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain,
          constructed according to a method used previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Each clone contained a different random
          peptide sequence inserted within a loop located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">157</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> which connects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the beta
          strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. Thus, the peptides were constrained at
          either end by the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          million random peptides of length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> was created in a
          yeast expression vector consisting of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î¼</NUMEX> circle origin,
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">selectable marker</ENAMEX>, and the yeast 
          ADH1 promotor driving expression of
          the hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was biased at the DNA level to
          avoid stop codons (see Methods), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly one third</NUMEX> of the
          clones were expected to contain in-frame stop codons
          within the insert, thus producing a truncated GFP
          molecule containing only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of GFP
          followed by C-terminal peptides of variable length up to
          15 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. At least some of these truncated products
          were expressed at high levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> when fused to lexA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caponigro</ENAMEX>, unpublished). The characteristics of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library sequences</ENAMEX> have been described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          No dramatic sequence biases were present.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 residue-long</NUMEX> random
          peptides were fused to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the lexA binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was also constructed. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was expressed
          from a vector that contained a centromere, a selectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>, and the 
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promotor</ENAMEX> to drive expression.
          Again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> inserts were biased against stop
          codons as for the internal peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Sequence
          analysis of a random set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> clones revealed an average
          C-terminal peptide sequence length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, with
          no discernible bias for or against particular amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Isolation of lexA-peptide activators
          To select for peptide activators, the lexA-GFP/peptide
          and lexA-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were introduced separately
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> and plated on selective media. Only
          cells that contained plasmids which activated expression
          of the lexA-regulated 
          LEU2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> grew. The reversion
          rate for the assay was low (< <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.001%</NUMEX>). Based on the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> per plate, frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.02%</NUMEX> of
          activating peptides in the lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> were calculated.
          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> individual lexA-GFP/peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> lexA-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> was recovered and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insert DNA</ENAMEX> sequences obtained. For the lexA-GFP/pep
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, these sequences condensed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> unique sequences
          with only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> sequences present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          remaining clones (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35</NUMEX>) were observed multiple times; one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> times (not shown). This suggests
          that the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of unique sequences was
          relatively small. Retests of individual clones revealed
          that ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> were 
          bona fide activators. For the
          lexA-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 11</NUMEX> were observed multiple
          times, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> single observations and a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
          unique sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retests</ENAMEX> confirmed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16/16</NUMEX>) as true
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Analysis of peptide activator sequences
          Statistical analysis of the activator peptide
          sequences from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> demonstrated biases in
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid composition</ENAMEX> and net charge. The frequency of
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> among the sequences was skewed significantly
          toward <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidic residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For the
          lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidic residues</ENAMEX> to
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>)/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K + R</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63/32</NUMEX>).
          When the net charge (assuming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E= -1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX>) was
          calculated for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> sequences, a highly significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> in charge distribution was detected (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The preponderance of negatively charged sequences
          exceeded that of positively charged ones by a factor of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone, recovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times
          and confirmed as an activator in plasmid linkage tests,
          had a net charge of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+3</NUMEX>, and there was no significant
          trend toward increased acidity among the more frequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (not shown). For the lexA-peptide activator set,
          the distribution was even more skewed. Negatively charged
          sequences exceeded positive ones by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45</NUMEX> vs.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal negative charge was included, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disparity</ENAMEX> was over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold. The (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>)/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K + R</ENAMEX>) ratio for
          this sequence set was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 4</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">127/31</NUMEX>). However, there
          were basic sequences among the set. For example, of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> confirmed to have transcriptional activator
          activity by plasmid linkage tests, one was charge neutral
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were basic (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and +1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Compared with
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid frequencies</ENAMEX> among the unselected lexA-peptide
          library sequences, there was a highly significant
          increase among activators of glutamate, leucine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX> and tryptophan ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><< 0.001</NUMEX>). Arginine was
          significantly under-represented. A bias against short
          peptides with stop codons that terminate translation
          before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> residue limit is reached was observed among
          the lexA-peptide activators. The mean length of
          activators was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.1</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> compared to a length of
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.7</NUMEX> in the unselected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          We also analyzed the activator sequences from the
          lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> which encoded truncated GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Based on their frequency in the non-selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, stop codons were expected at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> unique sequences <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/44</NUMEX>) contained stop codons
          within the random peptide sequence. Thus, there was
          neither a bias toward nor against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">truncated GFP</ENAMEX> molecules
          arising from insert stop codons in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21/44</NUMEX>) of unique activator
          sequences resulted in truncated GFP due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>
          frameshift alterations within the random oligonucleotide.
          Both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> frames hit stop codons in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> within
          10 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the random peptide sequence.
          Furthermore, from the total set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> unique sequences,
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> frameshifted. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX>
          frameshifted inserts were picked from the unselected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, both behaved as activators (not
          shown). Together, these results suggest that translation
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> frame of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, after the random peptide insert,
          results in a molecule with activator properties.
        
        
          Modularity of a peptide activator
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the peptide activators from the
          lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, derived from a frameshift in
          the insert, was tested for its ability to activate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> when separated from the GFP structure and
          directly fused to the lexA binding domain. This sequence,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">termed Core-Activating Sequence</ENAMEX> (CAS), contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> (WSFWIQEWNQS), had a net charge of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, and three
          tryptophan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were
          contributed by out-of-frame translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, one from
          the random peptide sequence, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' linker
          used to insert the random oligonucleotides for library
          construction. An expression construct was tested along
          with controls for its ability to activate transcription
          of 
          LEU2 . In a selection for the 
          LEU2 + phenotype, roughly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equivalent</ENAMEX> numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> formed on plates for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lexA-Gal4</ENAMEX> control activator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and for the grafted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, cell patches revealed a level of
          growth similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Gal4</NUMEX> control (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5and 6</NUMEX>).
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> was as potent a transcriptional activator as
          Gal4 in this growth assay.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> transactivating domains are
        relatively large, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length. However,
        fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native activator proteins</ENAMEX> have been described.
        An <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-amino-acid-long</NUMEX> acidic domain from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RelA</ENAMEX> subunit
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFÎº-B</ENAMEX> is capable of minimal activating behavior when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gal4 DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Gal4BD</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, when joined together in tandem arrays, is as
        potent as the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RelA transactivator</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al.
        showed that fragments of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Gal4</NUMEX> activation region between
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 and 41</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length provide activation
        functions of a magnitude in rough proportion to their
        length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . This result suggests that short sequences
        are capable of stimulating transcription when complexed
        with promotor elements and that their effect is amplified
        by increasing the total content of such short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
        A series of papers has explored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of random
        sequences, including random peptides, fused to DNA binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> in the context of transcriptional activation assays
        similar to those used in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptashne</ENAMEX> isolated a set of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA</ENAMEX> fragments that, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gal4BD</TIMEX>, promote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . All (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15/15</NUMEX>)
        active sequences examined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors encode</ENAMEX> predicted
        polypeptides that are acidic, and a peptide as small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 12</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> was seen. One sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B42</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> long,
        was shown to function as an activator when transferred to
        the lexA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang et al.</ENAMEX> serendipitously

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> activators of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that function as
        Gal4BD <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal fusions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> are acidic,
        with charge <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giniger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptashne</ENAMEX> found that a
        designed acidic, amphipathic alpha helix of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        activates transcription when fused to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Gal4BD</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Using 
        in vitro transcription assays, Gerber
        et al. demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homopolymeric</ENAMEX> stretches as short
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of glutamine or proline fused to the Gal4BD
        function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lu et al.</ENAMEX> screened
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal Gal4BD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long. Only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> was observed among the set of activator
        peptides, and no peptide had a net predicted positive
        charge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        An NMR structure for the lexA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain has
        been presented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is compact and
        globular, and probably interferes only minimally with fused
        transactivating sequences. In addition, the success of the
        yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid technique suggests that the geometric
        constraints on transactivation are not severe (i.e., the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding elements and the transactivating portion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>) do not require precise positioning
        with respect to each other). Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gal4-GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fusions</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unstable</ENAMEX>, we were unable to analyze the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>/peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> identified in the lexA hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
        context of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Gal4BD</TIMEX> (not shown). However, a peptide
        selected in the context of the amino terminal portion of
        GFP functioned effectively when this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was
        removed and the peptide was grafted directly onto lexA. Due
        to differences in expression levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal GFP</ENAMEX> peptide constructs, we did not consider it
        useful to pursue more quantitative transactivation studies
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 27</NUMEX> ] .
        Activator peptides were present in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> at
        remarkably high frequencies - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -3in the case of the
        C-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, approximately the same frequency
        observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lu et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold lower frequency
        of activators in the lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> may indicate
        a role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal negative charge, the specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometry</ENAMEX>, or the conformational flexibility of the fused
        (vs. inserted) peptides. Considerably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the
        activator sequences we observed had a large excess of
        negative charge, a finding that is consistent with the
        involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidic residues</ENAMEX> in the activation process [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . However, we observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> examples of charge
        neutral and basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> did not display obvious patterns of amphipathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicity</ENAMEX> based on the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutamine</ENAMEX> and proline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were not significantly
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in the sequence set. Instead, in addition
        to glutamate, large hydrophobic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were abundant.
        This result accords with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> experiments that have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pinpointed acidic residues</ENAMEX> and phenylalanine as special
        contributors to transactivation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 28</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> questions are raised by our and other studies of
        peptide activators: (i) what is the minimum size of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX>? and, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) what is the significance of the
        extreme sequence diversity evidenced by transactivating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>? We identified and tested an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-residue-long</NUMEX>
        activator that functioned in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different contexts: at the
        C-terminus of a truncated GFP molecule and attached
        directly to lexA. Because we did not direct our screen at
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX>, we suspect that a deliberate effort to
        identify smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activators</ENAMEX> would be fruitful. Indeed, Lu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-mer activators, though none was tested for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modularity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Nonetheless, the tendency for
        C-terminal activators to be longer than the average library
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peptide</ENAMEX> suggests a preference for length in the
        transactivation function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        The recruitment model for transcriptional activation
        stipulates that eukaryotic transcription is driven mainly
        by recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preformed RNA polymerase holoenzyme</ENAMEX> to
        specific sites on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . According to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        peptides may bind one of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that guide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holoenzyme</ENAMEX> to the lexA binding site. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> include
        components of holoenzyme and perhaps other factors [see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ref.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ]. Short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> can bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        reasonably high affinity (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , for review).
        Because transactivation is a process that involves
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>, it is not surprising that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains function as
        transactivators by bridging interactions that promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>.
        The wide range of primary sequences and sequence
        features described to date among peptide activators
        supports the recruitment model. Given the diversity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that comprise holoenzyme, this model implies that
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> of different types would be competent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX>; their sole requirement would be to bind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holoenzyme</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The acidic peptides may
        interact in a manner akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native activators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . But
        the basic ones may, for example, bind other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        contain acidic regions, thereby forming a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holoenzyme</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, these basic peptides may bind
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the holoenzyme component(s) recognized
        by acidic peptides, or entirely different subunits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Apart from scientific interest, these findings may have
        value in creating tools for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> discovery
        using the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system. Isolation of a panel of
        small peptides with different structural properties could
        improve the performance of the system by providing an
        option for multiple screens using a variety of peptides.
        This option might decrease false negatives and false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> if applied intelligently. For example, a series
        of positively charged, negatively charged and neutral
        peptides may enhance the accuracy of the method. In
        addition, short activating sequences may prove useful in
        the context of isolating peptides that interact with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Peptides that bind specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
        therapeutic interest in the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> have a
        variety of applications in drug development. These peptides
        could be used as lead-ins for creation of peptido-mimetics.
        Alternatively, they might provide reagents for
        high-throughput displacement screens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Typically,
        such peptides are isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> on the activation
        domain of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid system</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . By substituting
        small pepticals for the activation function, it may be
        possible to define binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with higher resolution in
        the context, for instance, of the reverse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
        approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caponigro et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished). Small
        peptides active in the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> may be
        synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrifield</ENAMEX> procedures, labeled, and used
        directly in screens for small molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . This
        approach might avoid laborious testing of hybrid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein/peptides</ENAMEX> to determine which peptides bind
        independent of their fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>. Finally, non-peptidic
        molecules that bind in a sequence-specific manner to DNA
        have been fused to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue peptides</ENAMEX>. These
        hybrid molecules activate transcription [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 31</ENAMEX> ] . It may
        be possible to produce small-molecule activators (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressors</ENAMEX>) that bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> specifically, but also activate
        transcription of adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> through a non-peptidic,
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>-like moiety.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Peptide activators are recovered from random peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> at high frequency. These peptides display
        significant sequence biases toward negative charge.
        However, basic activator peptides are also present in the
        set. These results are consistent with the recruitment
        model of transcriptional activation in eukaryotes and
        support the idea that small molecules directed at the
        transcription process may prove to be a useful therapeutic
        strategy.

        restriction digest analysis.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lexA-peptide library</ENAMEX> was created in a similar manner
        to the lexA-GFP/peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> except that the sequence
        downstream of the random insert contained stop codons in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> reading frames. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (of which over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> contain random peptides) were
        selected to indentify transcriptionally active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>.
        pVT725 was created by replacing the ampicillin
        resistance cassette on pLexA (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) with a kanamycin

        via homologous recombination in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> peptide was transferred to pLexA as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>
        complementary oligos which encoded the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> CAS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">oVT2899</TIMEX>:

        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> buffer and cloned using standard methods into pVT725
        via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI</ENAMEX> restriction sites. This resulted in the
        fusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> peptide onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of lexA.
        Transcriptionally active peptides were selected by

        selecting for transformants on plates lacking histidine.
        Transformants were then pooled and transferred onto plates
        lacking histidine and leucine in order to select for
        peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> capable of activating the
