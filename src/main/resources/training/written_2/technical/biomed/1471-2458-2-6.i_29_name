        Mefloquine was developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Army</ENAMEX> and introduced
        for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        Mefloquine was first used for prophylaxis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, and
        since then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 14.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been
        prescribed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> prevention, versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>
        million for treatment. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first decade</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s use, the reported
        adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] In the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1980s</TIMEX> it became clear that mefloquine could cause
        neuropsychiatric adverse effects. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] The first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomised</ENAMEX> controlled trial of mefloquine prophylaxis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX>, non-immune Western travellers was published
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> and found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of all mefloquine users
        reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> reported at least one severe adverse event (defined
        as requiring medical advice). [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        On the evidence from a case series published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann-La Roche</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organisation</ENAMEX> (WHO) recommends that travellers with a
        personal or family history of seizures or manic-depressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> should not take mefloquine prophylaxis. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ]
        However the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
        equivalent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CATMAT</ENAMEX>, do not recognise this as a valid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraindication</ENAMEX> to taking mefloquine. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        A recent analysis of spontaneous reports held on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> national pharmacovigilance database suggested that
        there is a mefloquine syndrome consisting of excessive
        sweating accompanied by malaise, nausea, diarrhoea,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agitation</ENAMEX>, concentration problems and nightmares. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        The aetiology of the adverse effects associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> use remains obscure. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> cohort studies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> generally experienced worse side
        effects from mefloquine than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] an eleventh did not find this effect. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomised</ENAMEX> controlled trials, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have tolerated
        mefloquine well. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surprisingly</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cohort study
        found that some older adult travellers tolerate mefloquine
        better than younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] It has also been
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> tolerate mefloquine better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Caucasians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] Despite early
        concerns, mefloquine appears to be safe in pregnancy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ]
        Although the adverse effects of mefloquine are common,
        and often serious and long lasting, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> has been
        widely used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 20 years</TIMEX>, no real attempts have so far
        been made to investigate and explain these effects. A
        systematic review of mefloquine prophylaxis, performed
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochrane Collaboration</ENAMEX>, now tabulates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> case
        reports published in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976-2000</TIMEX>,
        describing adverse effects from mefloquine at prophylactic
        and therapeutic dosages. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        We retrieved and critically reviewed all the original
        papers listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane</ENAMEX> review to clarify the
        phenomenology of the adverse effects associated with
        mefloquine, and to look for clues to possibly safer use of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Analysis of case reports
        
          Common features of the case reports
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> published case reports of mefloquine
          adverse effects recorded in the mefloquine systematic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328</NUMEX> of the reports related to prophylactic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> use, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> to treatment use. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX>
          cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> or business travellers. [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">One-third</ENAMEX> of the reports were in languages other
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> - mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>. The
          search strategy for finding the case reports is described
          in the review. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] An annotated bibliography of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> published reports can be found at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liv</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uk</ENAMEX>/evidence.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> of the case reports recorded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or</NUMEX> fewer
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> parameters (for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          age, sex and mefloquine dose taken), and many of these
          reports were little more than a short description of an
          unexpected adverse event, set in the context of a larger
          study. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of the reports however contained some
          discussion of the causality of the symptoms attributed to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> proposed a mechanism by which these
          symptoms might be occurring.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> case reports we reviewed described one
          or more symptoms consistent with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transient</ENAMEX>, anicteric chemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> (eg, malaise, fever, anorexia, headache,
          abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, concentration
          difficulties). Of the remaining reports, many were
          consistent with a 
          post-hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, although in
          some cases the disorders described could have been due to
          conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, chronic fatigue
          or jet lag.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of all the case reports described symptomatology
          suggesting acutely 
          disturbed thyroid function (eg,
          anorexia, fatigue, tremor, palpitations, nervousness,
          increased sweating, mood and/or sleep disturbance, memory
          and concentration disorders, emotional lability, altered
          bowel habit, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1categorises</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> published case reports
          according to whether the clinical features were 'very
          likely', 'plausibly' or probably 'unrelated' to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or
          thyroid pathology. We have based this classification on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> lists of the common symptoms and signs of liver
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thyroid disease</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] The direction of thyroid
          symptoms was mainly towards hyperthyroidism, though some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibited signs of both an over- and an
          under-active thyroid (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>
          alternating with bradycardia).
          The table also shows the median duration of symptoms
          reported by 'prophylactic' and 'treatment' mefloquine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, and the median dose taken within each category.
          The median duration of adverse effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
          took mefloquine as treatment appears to have been shorter
          than that of those who took the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> as prophylaxis (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 days</TIMEX>), even though the median dose of
          mefloquine taken was higher in the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. We
          believe that one explanation for this unexpected finding
          may lie in the fact that the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
          mefloquine were more likely to have taken the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> as
          monotherapy, whereas the prophylaxis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> more commonly
          took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. We
          discuss the possible significance of this later in this
          paper.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> and the liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> is an aryl amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> which accumulates
          in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and the lungs, and is subject to
          enterohepatic circulation. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] It has recently been
          found to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute hepatitis</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> does not appear to cause florid signs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>. However, transient subclinical
          disturbances of liver function are a common feature of
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> metabolised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, and this may explain
          the frequent finding of transaminase changes in safety
          studies of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>; these biochemical findings are
          usually dismissed as meaningless noise, but they may in
          fact be sensitive or oversensitive markers of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vulnerability</ENAMEX>, of low specificity.
          That mefloquine induces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzymes</ENAMEX> is well
          documented. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaspers et al</ENAMEX> reported significantly raised
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transaminases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marines</ENAMEX> who took mefloquine during
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>, and who were not drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>
          at the time. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takeshima</ENAMEX> found that of a cohort of
          healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> who took prophylactic
          mefloquine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 weeks</TIMEX> without drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-quarter</ENAMEX> developed symptoms compatible with liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> showed disturbed liver function. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reisinger et al</ENAMEX> observed the same phenomenon in a
          cohort of short-stay <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> travellers to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, but
          it is not clear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> could have contributed to
          this effect. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] One of the travellers, who was
          concurrently taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver-</ENAMEX>damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, sulfadoxine,
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] showed gross morphological changes in his liver
          which were attributed to his use of prophylactic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX>. Liver biopsy showed intralobular cellular
          infiltrates consisting of macrophages and eosinophils as
          well as sporadic eosinophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell necroses</ENAMEX>; virology was
          negative. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grieco et al</ENAMEX> described a 46-year-old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who drank wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> while taking mefloquine, and
          who became nervous and depressed, with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>, vomiting
          and diarrhoea. She was dehydrated and in severe liver
          failure, with negative virology. Liver biopsy showed
          diffuse macrovesical hepatic steatosis. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
          'Heavy sun exposure' is noted in a case report of a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> who reacted acutely to his second
          mefloquine tablet; it is likely that this sun exposure
          would have caused dehydration. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year old</TIMEX> French
          traveller, concurrently taking an oral contraceptive, had
          epileptic seizures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her sixth week</TIMEX> of mefloquine
          prophylaxis, directly after 'severe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exertion</ENAMEX>'. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] It
          seems likely that in some mefloquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> dehydration
          will impose an added burden on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, and that this
          could contribute to a severe reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Many
          long-haul travellers using mefloquine are mildly
          dehydrated from in-flight alcohol and air conditioning,
          followed by hot and dry conditions, and more alcohol
          consumption, at their holiday or business
          destination.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX> case reports we reviewed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> cited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> as possibly contributing to the adverse drug
          effects described. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittes et al</ENAMEX> reported a remarkable
          challenge-rechallenge experiment where a healthy male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geologist</ENAMEX> took both his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> weekly
          mefloquine tablet together with half a bottle of whisky,
          and on both occasions experienced acute paranoid
          delusions, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and suicidal ideation; a fellow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geologist</ENAMEX> who shared the same whisky bottle (and who was
          taking no antimalaria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>) experienced no such
          effects. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vuurman et al</ENAMEX>, sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann-La Roche</ENAMEX>, tested
          in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> might
          interact adversely with mefloquine. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] They found
          psychomotor performance unimpaired, but their study
          design had important limitations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          took mefloquine and of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> dropped out due
          to adverse events (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>, vomiting and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dizziness</ENAMEX>, the other with malaise, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> and headache).
          The study protocol forbade 'strenuous physical activity'
          and any prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> was given under
          strict laboratory conditions <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after mefloquine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingestion</ENAMEX>, and then in small and interrupted doses, such
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> concentration in any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>
          never exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> mg ml <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> admit that
          their study did not address 'the question of what might
          happen should (mefloquine users) consume intoxicating
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] Their findings can thus not be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalised</ENAMEX> to the broad population of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and
          business travellers.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the case reports listed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane</ENAMEX> review note some co-medication taken along with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quinoline</ENAMEX> derivatives (chiefly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroquine</ENAMEX> and quinine) are the commonest co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
          mentioned in the case reports. After antimalaria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>,
          an oral contraceptive (noted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> reports) is the next
          most commonly reported co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, followed by sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valproate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>). All these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> can cause
          liver damage. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diazepam</ENAMEX> is also a thyroid hormone
          antagonist, and we discuss below the possible
          significance of this. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meszaros et al</ENAMEX> reported a male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveller</ENAMEX> who in addition to mefloquine took
          thioridazine, amitriptyline and fluphenazine (all capable
          of damaging the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>), and whose mefloquine-associated
          neuropsychiatric symptoms persisted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year</TIMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gullahorn et al</ENAMEX> reported a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
          experienced delirium on emerging from anaesthesia,
          possibly because in addition to mefloquine they had
          received isoflurane, an anaesthetic known to cause
          hepatocellular necrosis. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 39</NUMEX> ]
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> report describes an acute reaction in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who

          The preclinical studies of mefloquine by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Army</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> of several organ systems, but not the thyroid.
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] The effect of mefloquine on thyroid function
          appears not to have been investigated in any phase III or

        Presentation of the hypothesis
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">mefloquine</ENAMEX> syndrome
          The published literature describes a mefloquine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> that presents in a variety of ways including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headache</ENAMEX>, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX>, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, and occasionally frank psychosis. Young
          western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are particularly vulnerable to mefloquine's
          adverse effects. Certain groups however (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, older
          adult travellers and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) tolerate mefloquine
          well.
        
        
          Hypothesis
          The phenomenology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s adverse effect
          profile, together with incidental details in some of the
          published case reports (references to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and to
          known hepatotoxic co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> such as the oral
          contraceptive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>) suggest that for many mefloquine
          users adverse drug effects may be the result of primary
          hepatocellular injury, caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in association
          with one or more concurrent liver insults. Further, it
          seems that in some of these symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
          mefloquine a transient thyroid disturbance may appear as
          well, either as an endocrine disorder secondary to the
          primary liver damage, or as an independent pathological
          process.
          We therefore postulate that many of the adverse
          effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused
          by primary liver damage. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> we believe
          that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either as an
          independent process, or as a secondary consequence of the
          initial hepatocellular injury.
          Previous liver or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thyroid disease</ENAMEX>, and concurrent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insults</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> (such as from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, dehydration,
          an oral contraceptive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>, recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that can damage the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>) may be related to the
          development of many severe or prolonged adverse reactions
          to mefloquine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that are thyroid hormone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> may also be risk factors.
        
        
          Relevant reports with other quinoline
          derivatives
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> is a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quinoline</ENAMEX>; other quinolines
          include primaquine, amodiaquine and chloroquine. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
          ]
          High doses of primaquine in rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> have caused
          acute fatal liver damage. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amodiaquine</ENAMEX> is still used to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, but was
          withdrawn from general use for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria prophylaxis</ENAMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> after it was found to cause liver damage and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, mostly anicteric. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 50</NUMEX> ] Some of these
          reports mention co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> known to damage liver
          cells (phenylbutazone, oral contraceptive, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amodiaquine</ENAMEX> has not been linked to disturbed thyroid
          function.
          The possibility of a three-way interaction has already
          been suggested between a quinoline derivative
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">chloroquine</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and the thyroid. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munera et al</ENAMEX>
          described a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with hypothyroidism, well stabilised on
          thyroxine sodium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> μg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, who took prophylactic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroquine</ENAMEX> and proguanil <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> for a
          vacation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> her thyroid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stimulating hormone</ENAMEX> (TSH) concentration was found to be
          very high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44.8 mU/1</NUMEX>, normal range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>), but it
          returned to normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a week</TIMEX> of her stopping the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-challenge with chloroquine and proguanil a year
          later again resulted in raised levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSH</ENAMEX>, a lowered
          concentration of free triiodothyronine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ), and normal free thyroxine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ) concentration. Liver function was
          not tested, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> speculated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Chloroquine</ENAMEX>... seems to have enhanced the induction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzymes</ENAMEX>. [It] probably increased the catabolism of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thyroid hormones</ENAMEX> by enzymatic induction. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] They also
          suggested that chloroquine might act centrally on the
          hypothalamus, through disruption of the feedback system
          by which thyrotropin releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> stimulates the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pituitary</ENAMEX> to release and later synthesise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSH</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ]
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> mechanism by which chloroquine and chemically
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as mefloquine might interfere with
          thyroid function is through structural homology to T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , resulting in thyroid hormone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonism</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloroquine</ENAMEX> injections
          more than halve the T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> concentration, without changing the
          level of free T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chloroquine</ENAMEX> has been
          reported to inhibit T

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibiting</ENAMEX> receptor-mediated endocytosis. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ]
        
      
      
        Testing the hypothesis
        Our hypothesis needs to be tested through a large
        multicentre cohort study of mefloquine prophylaxis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and business travellers, perhaps recruited in
        collaboration with one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>. Small randomised
        controlled trials should test specific elements of the
        hypothesis, such as the postulated link between mefloquine
        and thyroid disturbance, and the presumed interaction
        between mefloquine and oral contraception. National
        pharmacovigilance databases should also be analysed
        systematically to see if the spontaneous reports of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s adverse effects tend to support our hypothesis
        or not.
        The multicentre cohort study of prophylactic mefloquine
        use should be questionnaire-based, and should enquire
        specifically into the major risk factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake
        during travel, hydration status, use of hormonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraception</ENAMEX> and recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, other potentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatotoxic</ENAMEX> or thyrotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, previous history of proven
        or suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and/or thyroid abnormality) that we have
        proposed. The study design should include pre- and
        post-exposure testing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and thyroid function in at
        least a sample of the cohort.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> or more case-control studies should be nested within
        the cohort study. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] These nested studies would
        allow for rigorous testing of the aetiological mechanisms
        which we have proposed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mefloquine</TIMEX>'s adverse effects.
        The studies should also resolve those prescribing issues on
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>' opinions differ (eg, Is mefloquine safe in
        pregnancy? Is it safe for long-term prophylaxis? Should
        airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> be prescribed mefloquine? Should mefloquine
        be prescribed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a personal or family history
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neuropsychiatric illness</ENAMEX>? Can mefloquine be given safely
        as a pre-travel loading dose, for rapid induction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprophylaxis</ENAMEX>? [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 57</NUMEX> ] ).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> is a clinically important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, commonly used
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy people</ENAMEX>. A much higher standard of safety is
        therefore required for mefloquine prophylaxis than for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> given to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serious diseases</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] The study
        we propose is urgently needed.
      
      
        Implications of the hypothesis
        
          What our hypothesis explains
          The hypothesis explains much of the complexity of the
          pattern of adverse effects of mefloquine, and also the
          fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy users</ENAMEX> of the drug suffer no
          adverse effects at all. It also explains some aspects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s tolerability profile in travellers which
          until now have not been understood, notably that young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> experience more adverse effects from mefloquine
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and older adult travellers
          (who do not use oral contraception, and who rarely misuse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>) seem to tolerate the drug well. In addition, our
          hypothesis may explain the ethnic and inter individual
          variations in the pharmacokinetics of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, which
          until now have not been understood. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ]
          It has been known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> that mefloquine users
          who take co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.5</NUMEX> times more likely
          to experience an adverse drug event than those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who
          take no co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and twice as likely to experience
          severe adverse drug events. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] The frequency of
          reported adverse drug events also increases when multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> are taken. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] Our hypothesis plausibly
          explains these earlier findings.
          The use of marijuana and other psychoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> by
          chloroquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> has been associated with acute
          psychotic reactions, and it has been suggested that
          mefloquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who take recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> may likewise
          be predisposed to neuropsychiatric problems. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] We
          believe that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is consistent with our
          hypothesis, since recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> can cause
          hepatocellular damage and liver failure. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
          A puzzling observation is that although the adverse
          effects of mefloquine are usually reversible, in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> these effects can persist for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> or even
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> has been stopped. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] We believe
          that the occasionally protracted time course of the
          adverse effects can be plausibly explained by supposing
          that in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> mefloquine is just one of several
          concurrent insults to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, and that it is the
          continuance of the other insults (most commonly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
          and certain prescription drugs) that makes the
          mefloquine-induced syndrome persist. Some published
          evidence supports this view. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 62 69</NUMEX> ] There is
          evidence from this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that the adverse
          effects of mefloquine in those who have taken the drug
          prophylactically persist longer than they do in patients
          who have been treated with it, even though the latter
          group mostly receive larger doses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>; this
          paradox might be explained by the fact that although
          prophylactic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> usually stop mefloquine as soon as
          they have experienced adverse effects, they often
          continue to assault their livers in other ways, and it is
          this which makes the effects persist.
          Most of the reported adverse effects of mefloquine fit
          into the model we propose. For example, mefloquine has
          been associated with a wide variety of dermatological
          adverse effects, and most of these can be linked with
          effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or thyroid. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 55</NUMEX> ] Convulsions
          and dizziness are other reported effects of mefloquine
          which can be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or thyroid disturbance. [ 2
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> ]
        
        
          Who should not take mefloquine?
          We believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a history of any proven or
          suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or thyroid abnormality in the previous
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> should avoid mefloquine. Travellers taking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> should not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink alcohol</ENAMEX>, especially within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX> dose.
          While taking mefloquine, travellers should be advised
          to maintain good hydration with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or carbonated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, especially on long plane journeys or during
          arduous work in hot conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or coffee
          should not be used to maintain hydration, since they all
          increase water loss.
          Travellers taking mefloquine should not take a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hormonal</ENAMEX> contraceptive, nor any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> known to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">injure liver cells</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] They should not take any drug
          known to antagonise thyroid hormone. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] We propose
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that are known to cause hepatocellular injury 
          and also to be thyroid hormone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> should be absolutely contraindicated in
          mefloquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>; such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> include amiodarone,
          benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers and phenytoin.

          Because of the potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive toxicity</ENAMEX>,
          travellers taking mefloquine should avoid concurrent use
          of any other quinoline derivative (eg, amodiaquine,
          chloroquine, primaquine, quinidine, quinine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tafenoquine</ENAMEX>), whether for additional prophylaxis or for
          treatment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of a different quinoline
          derivative at the same time as mefloquine may increase
          the risk of adverse effects. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 72</NUMEX> ] For the same
          reason, mefloquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> should avoid other quinine
          analogues, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
          Fluoroquinolones, such as sparfloxacin, of loxacin and
          ciprofloxacin, are increasingly prescribed in severe
          cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveller</ENAMEX>'s diarrhoea, and have been associated
          with severe reactions in mefloquine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ]
        
        
          Who should take mefloquine?
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> is a safe and exceptionally useful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> for
          the mass prophylaxis and treatment of those resident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>-endemic areas which traditionally
          abstain from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and hormonal contraception. It has
          been suggested that in such settings, mefloquine should
          be combined with artemisinin or a derivative to protect
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ]
          On the basis of our hypothesis, we believe that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and also pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, can safely be
          prescribed mefloquine (because neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> uses alcohol
          or oral contraceptives).
          Accompanied by explicit advice to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
          maintain good hydration, and use co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> with
          caution, we believe that prophylactic mefloquine could be
          recommended to certain occupational subsets of travellers
          who carry out safety-critical tasks and who until now
          have been denied the use of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. These occupational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> include airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> of heavy machinery. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ]
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> advise that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travellers</ENAMEX> engaged in
          high-risk leisure pursuits, such as mountain climbing,
          should not use mefloquine. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] We believe that this
          exclusion is unjustified, as long as there is no recent
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thyroid disease</ENAMEX>, and provided the
          precautions we have proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX> (avoidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
          maintenance of hydration and non-use of hormonal
          contraception, recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>) are adhered to.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lobel et al</ENAMEX> consider that WHO's exclusion of people
          with a personal or family history of neuropsychiatric
          illness from taking mefloquine is based 'on limited
          evidence or theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>', and we believe their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scepticism</ENAMEX> is justified. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuropsychiatric</ENAMEX> illness
          may not contraindicate use of mefloquine, provided that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is not currently taking anything that can
          cause liver damage or thyroid disturbance.
