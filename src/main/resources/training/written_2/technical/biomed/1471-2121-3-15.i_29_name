        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) form a subfamily
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transforming Growth Factor β</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-β</ENAMEX>) superfamily [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were initially
        identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone
        formation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Functional characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and
        the cloning of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> have revealed that
        BMPs not only regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation and homeostasis but
        also function as morphogenetic factors for many other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The critical regulatory roles of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early embryogenesis</TIMEX>, such as neurogenesis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesoderm</ENAMEX> formation and patterning, are also well-recognized
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β superfamily, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> induce
        intracellular signaling via heteromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of the
        type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II serine</ENAMEX>-threonine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX>
        ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smad</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are now known to function as
        key signal transducers downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> type
        I <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . The activated BMP type I receptors
        directly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX> and phosphorylate a set of cytoplasmic
        Smad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are specific for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> such BMP type I receptor-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smads</ENAMEX>,
        Smad1, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 8</NUMEX>, have been identified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Among them,
        Smad1 has been studied most extensively. The
        phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> at the carboxylterminal SSVS motif
        triggers the release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Smad1</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, the
        formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo-oligomers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and hetero-oligomers
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and Smad4</TIMEX>, and the subsequent nuclear
        translocation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 10</NUMEX> ] . In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad4</NUMEX> function as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . However, there is a
        unique feature in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smad</ENAMEX>-regulated transcription. Instead of
        independently binding to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence to regulate
        transcription, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> are now considered to be
        transcriptional modulators since their ability to regulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> is dependent, in most cases, on their
        physical interaction with other nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        transcription factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Thus, one of the fundamental
        questions in understanding Smad-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> is
        how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> function as transcription modulators.
        The transcriptional regulatory activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> in
        the nucleus are associated with its ability to directly
        bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , its interaction with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        transcription factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SIP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] , and also its interaction with the master
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcriptional</ENAMEX> co-activator <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Smad4 is an
        essential functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smad</ENAMEX>-regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and also interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p300</ENAMEX> via a domain
        within the central linker region named as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAD</ENAMEX> (Smad
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation Domain</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p300</ENAMEX> has intrinsic
        histone acetyltransferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAT</ENAMEX>) activity and participates
        in chromatin remodeling, the recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> is likely a
        critical step in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smad</ENAMEX>-regulated gene activation. However,
        our current knowledge of the molecular events involved in
        the recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> and other transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-activators or co-repressors by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> is still very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying
        the cooperative functional partnership between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> and
        Smad4 during transcriptional regulation is not yet
        understood.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein-protein interaction</ENAMEX> plays key roles in signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. To gain further understanding of the
        signaling mechanisms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, we carried out a "blind"
        search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind specifically to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> using
        the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system. Characterization of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactors</ENAMEX> reveals an unexpected physical and functional
        link between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> and the proteasome-mediated degradation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome is responsible for the bulk
        turnover of cytoplasmic and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in eukaryotic
        cells and also plays a key role in the regulation of cell
        cycle, signal transduction, transcription as well as
        antigen presentation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Most of the known
        proteasomal substrates are marked and targeted to
        proteasome by ubiquitination [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Ubiquitination,
        however, is not an obligatory step for substrate targeting
        to proteasome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 20</NUMEX> ] . The degradation of the
        ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme for
        polyamine synthesis, involves a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> named antizyme
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>), which binds and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome for
        degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> has remained an "orphan"
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Az</ENAMEX>-dependent proteasomal degradation.
        Interestingly, both ubiquitin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> were isolated from
        the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interactors</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral</ENAMEX> component of proteasome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , which is a β subunit of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> catalytic core,
        was also isolated as a strong and specific Smad1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactor</ENAMEX>. Functional characterization of the interaction
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> in the signaling pathways of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> led us to find a novel functional link between Smad1
        and proteasome-mediated degradation events, through which a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">novel CBP/p300</ENAMEX> repressor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , is removed to
        allow the transcriptional activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-responsive
        genes.
      
      
        Results
        
          The isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1 interacting proteins</ENAMEX> reveals
          a physical interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in
          proteasome-mediated degradation pathways
          We applied the yeast "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protein Trap</ENAMEX>" system to isolate
          Smad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interactors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> length Smad1 was fused
          with the DNA-binding domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LexA</ENAMEX> to serve as bait. A
          human fetal brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with cDNA inserts fused
          with the transcriptional activation domain B42 was used
          for the screen. From screening <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one million cDNA</NUMEX> clones,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> clones exhibited strong activation of both of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Leu2</ENAMEX>). Thirteen different cDNA
          inserts were identified from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> clones. The ability
          of these thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate Smad1 interactors</ENAMEX> to bind
          Smad1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3 and Smad4</TIMEX> were directly tested in the
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Among the thirteen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">isolated Smad1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interactors</ENAMEX>, only clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 17, 19 and 21</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bind Smad2</ENAMEX>, whereas only clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 17 and 21</TIMEX> exhibit
          strong interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> clone (clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>)
          among the thirteen clones interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>.
          Interestingly, this clone encodes a truncated Smad1
          lacking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its MH1</TIMEX> domain. Such an interaction is consistent
          with the known ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX> to bind Smad4 upon its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          The identities of the thirteen interactors are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summarized</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). We divided the
          interactors into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group contains <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have a functional link
          to the degradation pathways of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome. They
          are: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ubiquitin precursors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UBA80</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clone 1</ENAMEX>) and UBA52
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">clone 21</NUMEX>), the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>)
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">clone 15</NUMEX>) and the proteasome β subunit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> (clone
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MBP-1</ENAMEX> (c-Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding Protein</ENAMEX>, clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> (clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tumor Associated Gene</ENAMEX>,
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proliferation Associated Gene</ENAMEX>,
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 12, 27 and 28</TIMEX>, which we named as
          SNIP1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIP3 and SIP4</TIMEX>, respectively. The functional
          characterization of clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SNIP1</NUMEX>) as a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CBP</ENAMEX>/p300
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactor</ENAMEX> and repressor has been reported recently in
          the signaling pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The functional
          characterization of clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SIP2</NUMEX>) as a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          the sorting nexin family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> has also been reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . Studies of the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein SIP3</ENAMEX> will be reported
          separately (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paralkar et al</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
          preparation).
          We were intrigued by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ub</ENAMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Az and HsN3</TIMEX>, all of which are involved in
          proteasome-mediated degradation pathways, as illustrated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>. The well-known
          ubiquitin-dependent pathway involves the covalent
          attachment of ubiquitin to substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to form
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyubiquitin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, which then targets the marked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> to proteasome for degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
          The ubiquitin-independent pathway is not well defined,
          but involves targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than ubiquitin. The
          best-characterized example of ubiquitin-independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> is the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX>), which is dependent upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> interaction with the
          targeting protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antizyme</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . How
          ubiquitinated substrates or Az-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> is recognized by
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome is not well understood. HsN3 is a β
          subunit of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20S</NUMEX> core of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome and
          previously has also been implicated in targeting its
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein p105</ENAMEX> subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> into the 26S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 32</NUMEX> ] . Thus, it is interesting that
          Smad1 can bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of proteasome
          substrate-targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (ubiquitin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>) as well
          as a proteasome component (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HsN3</NUMEX>) that has a possible
          substrate-targeting role. Studies were then carried out
          to further characterize Smad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells and test a functional role of these
          interactions in the signaling pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> as
          detailed below.
        
        
          Smad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> with prosequence-containing HsN3
          but not processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20S</TIMEX> proteasome and the
          activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor enhances the
          interaction
          We first focused upon the physical interaction between
          Smad1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>. As one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> β subunits of the 20S
          proteasome, the newly translated HsN3 has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          44 amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid prosequence</ENAMEX>, which is processed upon the
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> into the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20S</TIMEX> proteasome
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . The assembly of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome
          involves multiple steps and the formation of assembly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . As illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven single α</NUMEX> subunits first form the α <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>, which
          serves as the template for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven β</TIMEX> subunits to assemble
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">β ring</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> proteasomes containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> α and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">β</ENAMEX> rings are further assembled into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome, a
          process involving the proteolytic cleavage of the
          prosequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> β subunits, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX>. The 20S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> then combines with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 19S regulatory complex
          to form the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome, which is the degradation
          machinery responsible for both ubiquitin-dependent and
          ubiquitin-independent degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The
          prosequences of the proteolytic β subunits are important
          to keep the proteolytic sites inaccessible to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. In addition, the prosequences still bind to
          the β subunits after its cleavage and may serve important
          chaperon roles for the β subunits to be properly
          positioned into assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. This was demonstrated
          previously by artificially removing the prosequence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> β subunit and showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of this β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is completely blocked while separate expression
          of the prosequence was enough to restore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . The defective assembly of a β subunit due to the
          lack of prosequence is illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B.
          To follow up the observed interaction between Smad1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells, we first constructed three
          HsN3 expression constructs. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> construct contains
          a Flag-epitope placed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N3-F</ENAMEX>),
          since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is not buried inside of the
          mature proteasome, according to the crystal structure of
          HsN3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> constructs contain
          either the Flag or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T7</TIMEX> epitopes placed at the
          N-terminus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-ΔN3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7-ΔN3</ENAMEX>). Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          prosequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is processed upon assembly into the
          20S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX>, we deleted the prosequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> and
          replaced it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flag/T7-</ENAMEX>epitopes to assure that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> will not be lost due to prosequence-processing.
          We first expressed these constructs into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells and
          examined their expression and assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> by
          immunoprecipitation of each expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolically</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">COS1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). Multiple
          endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells were co-precipitated
          with Flag tagged wild type HsN3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), while
          much few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were detected in the immunoprecipitates
          of the two deletion versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> lacking the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prosequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 & 4</ENAMEX>). The predominant
          band in the immunoprecipitation of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> is the
          prosequence-containing HsN3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX>), as indicated by
          its molecular weight and the ability of anti-Flag
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to detect it in a parallel Western blot. The
          other predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> immediately below <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX> is the
          mature form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the ability of
          this band to be also detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Flag</ENAMEX> on the Western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> and by its co-migration with the deletion version of
          N3 lacking the prosequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-ΔN3</ENAMEX> in lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The rest of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> detected in the immunoprecipitates of wild
          type full length HsN3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) are predominantly
          different subunits of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome and 19S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, as indicated by their molecular weights and
          their ability to be recognized by anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20S</NUMEX> and anti-19S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The lack of most of these
          endogenous proteasome components in the
          immunoprecipitates of the two deletion version of HsN3
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosequences</ENAMEX> have been artificially removed via
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletions</ENAMEX> indicates that the prosequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is also
          important for its successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> into the mature 20S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX>. The slight different band patterns detected
          in the immunoprecipitates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-ΔN3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7-ΔN3</ENAMEX> suggests
          that different epitope tags may influence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N3</TIMEX> interaction
          with endogenous proteasome components. Since mature β
          subunits are only found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20S</TIMEX> proteasome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
          the detection of the mature form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flag</ENAMEX>-tagged HsN3
          assured us that the exogenous Flag-tagged HsN3 proteins
          are normal in their ability to be incorporated into the
          20S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX>.
          We then tested the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HsN3</NUMEX> to bind Smad1 in
          COS1 cells by transient transfection followed by
          immunoprecipitation assays. To monitor the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3-containing</TIMEX> proteasome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, immunoprecipitation were carried out using
          total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolically</ENAMEX> labeled COS1
          cells. Upon the immunoprecipitation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, only the
          full-length HsN3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but not the processed mature
          form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>, was detected to co-precipitate with Smad1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Although the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is associated with many other
          endogenous proteasome components from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COS cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3A, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), these endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also
          were not detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> only binds
          the prosequence-containing HsN3 (pro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N3</NUMEX>-F), which, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, only exists transiently before
          the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX>. Our domain mapping
          studies in yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> have previously
          suggested that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MH2</NUMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> is necessary for
          its interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Thus we also tested
          the interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1 MH2</ENAMEX> domain.
          Pro<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-N3-F</ENAMEX> was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of
          Smad1MH2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), suggesting that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MH2</NUMEX> domain is sufficient to bind to the pre-assembled
          HsN3.
          To test whether the observed interaction between Smad1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX>, the pre-assembled form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>, is
          regulated by BMP type I receptor activation, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX> with a mutant type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>. ALK3Q233D is constitutively active
          in inducing downstream signaling events in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> or the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The co-expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALK3Q233D with Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> significantly increased
          the amount of the pre-assembled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> that was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 2 & 3</ENAMEX>). Smad1 was also detected in the
          immunoprecipitates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 & 3</ENAMEX>).
          Since equal transfection efficiency was monitored and
          equal total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were used for the
          immunoprecipitation, the increased signals of pro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N3</NUMEX>-F
          and its associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, left
          panel, may reflect an increased stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> due to
          complex formation with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, upon BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
          The association between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX> was further
          confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot
          analyses. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX> was
          specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1
          but not those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad2</TIMEX>. When the activated BMP type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was co-expressed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX>, a
          reduction of Smad1 level was detected and the reduction
          is blocked by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor
          lactacystin, indicating the proteasomal degradation of
          Smad1 induced by BMP type I receptor activation. This
          phenomenon was further investigated and confirmed in a
          separate study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> was also stabilized in the presence of
          proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>).
          Western blot using anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome was also carried
          out to show that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX>, not mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N3</TIMEX>, nor other
          proteasome components, was co-precipitated with Smad1
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Smad1 can interact with prosequence-deleted HsN3 in
          HsN3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> intermediates
          The lack of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> and other proteasome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> in the immunoprecipitates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> could be
          mediated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different mechanisms. First, the
          prosequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>, which is processed from the mature
          HsN3, is necessary for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> to bind to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
          final maturation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX> resulted from the
          assembly of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two half</NUMEX> proteasomes into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stacked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring structure</ENAMEX> could trap the already bound Smad1 inside
          the proteasome for rapid degradation or lead to the
          dissociation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Smad1</NUMEX> from mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20S</TIMEX> proteasome due to
          the inaccessibility of Smad1 binding site on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">incorporated HsN3.</ENAMEX> We first tested the role of the
          prosequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> in binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4C, artificial removal of the prosequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3 (ΔN3</ENAMEX>)
          did not abolish Smad1 binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>. In fact, the
          interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔN3 and Smad1</TIMEX> was even stronger when
          directly compared with the interaction between wild type
          HsN3 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> (data not shown). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> does not
          require the prosequence to bind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. Since we have
          shown that artificial removal of the prosequence of HsN3
          leads to a blockage of the normal assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> into
          the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">proteasome</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C), we suspect that the
          detected strong signals of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ΔN3</NUMEX> from Smad1
          immunoprecipitates reflect the accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HsN3</NUMEX> within
          the defective assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intermediates</ENAMEX>, as illustrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B. To test this possibility, we directly compared
          the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1 MH2</ENAMEX> domain to bind wild type HsN3
          and prosequence-less mutant HsN3 in metabolically labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4E</ENAMEX>). When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells were
          expressing wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX>, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3-F</ENAMEX> was detected
          in the immunoprecipitates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1MH2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells were expressing the mutant HsN3 lacking
          the prosequence, the mutant N3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(ΔN3</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ΔN3</ENAMEX> associated
          endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were detected in the
          immunoprecipitates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1MH2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In
          addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct small molecular weight proteins
          with unknown identity were also recruited into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ΔN3/MH2</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and</NUMEX> lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bands were specifically detected only when
          Smad1MH2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ΔN3</ENAMEX> were co-expressed. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1MH2</ENAMEX> was
          replaced with full length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN3</NUMEX>-containing
          complex was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of
          Smad1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4F). Thus, a blockage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> assembly
          resulted from deleting the prosequence of HsN3 allows the
          detection of a stable complex between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> and HsN3
          assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intermediates</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that Smad1
          interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> transiently when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is either in
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX>-HsN3 form, or in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX>-HsN3 assembly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX>. The lack of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> in Smad1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX> does not reflect the inability of
          Smad1 to bind prosequence-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less HsN3</NUMEX>, but is likely due to
          either the trapping/degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX> inside of the
          proteasome, or the rapid dissociation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Smad1</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>.
          The degradation of Smad1 by proteasome is reported in a
          separate study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The dissociation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Smad1</NUMEX> from
          the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20S</TIMEX> proteasome could be due to the competition
          of Smad1 binding by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">19S regulator protein</ENAMEX> or simply due
          to the inaccessibility of the binding site on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> when
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two half</NUMEX> proteasomes assembly into the mature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> separate domains on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> mediate interaction with
          Smad1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> prior to HsN3 incorporation into the 20S
          proteasome
          We next examined the interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and Smad1
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells. In the absence of the co-expressed HsN3,
          Smad1 was co-precipitated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 1</ENAMEX>). The interaction was diminished when cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfected with the activated BMP type I receptor
          ALK3Q233D (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, the
          addition of proteasome inhibitor LLnL stabilizes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Thus, Smad1
          interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells and the interaction
          is also enhanced upon BMP type I receptor activation. In
          the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid tests, we also observed the ability
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> to bind HsN3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Domain mapping analyses of Az
          reveals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate domains on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> that are involved in
          binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). In mammalian cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Az with Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> leads to the
          detection of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro-N3</ENAMEX> in the
          immunoprecipitates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          There appears to be a stoichiomatric relationship between
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, since the relative levels of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> influence the interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5C). These data suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> might
          form a ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Since we again only detected the
          pro-sequence form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Az</ENAMEX> precipitates, such a
          ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is likely formed along the assembly
          pathways of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor induces
          Smad1-dependent nuclear translocation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> and
          Az
          Smad1 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the
          nucleus upon its activation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . The physical interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and
          HsN3 suggests that BMP signaling might regulate the
          intracellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>. We tested the
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous HsN3</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COS1</TIMEX> cell line, which
          was transiently transfected with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALK3</ENAMEX> and the BMP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Cells were either not exposed to BMP2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A), or treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP2</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 mins</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B) or
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 mins</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). Cells were stained with a monoclonal
          anti-HsN3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse
          secondary (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,6C</ENAMEX>, panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and simultaneously
          with a polyclonal anti-Smad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and
          rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,6C</ENAMEX>, panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The co-localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and
          HsN3 was detected by overlaying the signals in panels 1
          and panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and shown in panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Smad1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> were
          detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in cells
          that were not exposed to BMP2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A, panels <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3</ENAMEX>). In
          cells treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP2</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mins, most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> and Smad1
          were concentrated in the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> &
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and co-localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX> was detected in
          the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with
          BMP2 for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mins, all signals of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and HsN3</TIMEX> were
          detected to be co-localized in the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">panels 1-3</ENAMEX>).
          We further tested the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> in the nuclear
          translocation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>. HsN3 was detected in speckled
          pattern throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus when it
          was expressed alone in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>).
          Similar localization pattern was detected when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>) or with
          ALK3Q233D (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>). However, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>, the majority
          of HsN3 signals were detected in the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D,
          panel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Thus, the nuclear translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is
          dependent upon both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX> and the
          presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. Similarly, the localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> is
          also dependent upon the co-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6E, panels <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4</ENAMEX>). When
          Smad1 was replaced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> was found in both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> and the nucleus upon the co-expression of
          ALK3Q233D (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6E, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>), although cytoplasmic
          signals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> were slightly decreased. This could be due
          to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous Smad1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells.
          Thus, the localization of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> is
          regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX>-dependent
          manner. This data confirms the physical interaction
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> and further suggests that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> forms a complex with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and
          brings these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into the nucleus upon the
          activation of BMP type I receptor.
        
        
          The novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">repressor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is recruited to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> upon the activation of BMP type I receptor
          The observed physical interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, HsN3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and the regulation of the complex formation by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> suggests a functional role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> in the
          signaling function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. In a separate study, we have
          shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> play targeting roles in the
          proteasomal degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> upon the activation of
          BMP type I <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The observed proteasomal
          degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> upon the activation of BMP signaling
          could simply serve to irreversibly terminate
          Smad1-mediated signaling pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>. However, we
          observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> also interact with several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">isolated Smad1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interactors</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3 with Smad1</ENAMEX> also suggests
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteasomal</ENAMEX> targeting role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> in
          the nucleus. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and
          HsN3 also target Smad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting proteins</ENAMEX> in the
          nucleus.
          Among the isolated <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX> interactors shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> encodes a novel nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> named as Smad1
          Nuclear Interacting Protein-1 (SNIP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Our recent
          studies suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CBP</ENAMEX>/p300
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . SNIP1, when expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells,
          is entirely localized to distinct areas within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and
          HsN3 in the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system, in addition to its
          ability to bind Smad1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B). SNIP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> exhibited
          similar affinity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7B). Domain mapping studies showed that the linker region
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> was sufficient to bind SNIP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). To
          confirm the interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> or HsN3 seen
          in the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system, we transfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells
          with each pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and tested the interactions by
          immunoprecipitation assays. Upon the co-expression with
          SNIP1, the pre-assembled form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7D, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 & 2</ENAMEX>).
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> is a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the interaction between
          SNIP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> may require the nuclear translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>.
          Based upon the observation that the nuclear translocation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> is dependent upon Smad1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6E), we therefore tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> interaction
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">SNIP1</NUMEX> in the presence of the co-expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>,
          Smad4 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>. In the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>Az
          was detected in the precipitates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7E, top
          panel, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the co-expression of ALK3Q233D
          allowed the detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-Az</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> immunoprecipitates
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7E, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A weak Smad1 signal but no
          Smad4 signal was detected in SNIP1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, in the mammalian overexpression system, the
          pre-assembled HsN3 exhibits constitutive interaction with
          SNIP1, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> is only recruited to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>. The lack of strong signals of Smad1
          or Smad4 in the immunoprecipitates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of BMP type I receptor activation may be due to
          the transient nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which, as shown
          below, is targeted to proteasome for degradation.
        
        
          BMP type I receptor activation induces SNIP1
          degradation that is regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and
          Az
          To follow the observed reduction of SNIP1 level upon
          the expression of high level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>, as mentioned
          above, we co-expressed SNIP1 together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and high dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 μg</ENAMEX>) of either the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALK3</ENAMEX> or
          the constitutive active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western blot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A). A
          dramatic decrease of SNIP1 level was detected in
          ALK3Q233D-transfected cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">& 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>-induced decrease of
          SNIP1 is partially sensitive to the proteasome-specific
          inhibitor lactacystin, suggesting the involvement of
          proteasomal degradation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          incomplete rescue of SNIP1 level by lactacystin suggests
          the involvement of additional mechanisms other than 26S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> degradation. To systematically
          demonstrate the role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in the
          observed decrease of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1 protein</ENAMEX> level, we sequentially
          left out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the above assay.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ALK3Q233D</NUMEX>-induced degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1</ENAMEX> was
          significantly blocked in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A,
          panel <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, lanes 4 & 5</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 6 & 7</ENAMEX>), or
          Smad1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 8 & 9</ENAMEX>). Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ALK3Q233D</NUMEX>-induced
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and is only induced by high dose of
          the activated BMP type I receptor. Interestingly, by
          simply replacing Smad1 with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1 mutant Smad1G419S</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] , which is defective in binding to BMP type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated phosphorylation and the
          subsequent nuclear translocation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> degradation was
          also inhibited (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 & 11</TIMEX>),
          suggesting that the degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is dependent
          upon the type I receptor-mediated phosphorylation of
          Smad1. The levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Atop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX> and plotted as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Optical Density</ENAMEX>

          We noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and
          Az were co-regulated with that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX>. For example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> were all sensitive
          to lactacystin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, compare lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 3</ENAMEX>). Blocking SNIP1 degradation was accompanied by
          increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in cells
          expressing the activated ALK3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, 9,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). The lower levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> compared with those in lane <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> suggest that the
          leaky signaling by the overexpressed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3</TIMEX>, which we have
          demonstrated recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , caused a constitutive
          reduction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> level that is dependent
          upon the activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. These data thus suggest
          that SNIP1 is targeted to proteasome for degradation
          together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>.
          The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> in regulating SNIP1 degradation
          was further demonstrated by increased expression of Smad1
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS1</NUMEX> cells that were transfected with a constant
          amount of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Az</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK3Q233D and SNIP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B). A
          dose-dependent effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-induced
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1</ENAMEX> was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B, compare lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 & 2</ENAMEX> with lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 & 6</ENAMEX>).
          To confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> degradation in non-overexpression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, we monitored the steady state levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keratinocyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HaCaT</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myoblast</ENAMEX> L6. Cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP7</ENAMEX> for
          different periods of time. Western blot analyses using an
          anti-SNIP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> with
          slightly different mobility, which are named as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX>.A
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX>.B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOD</ENAMEX> of each form of
          SNIP1 as well as the total IOD of both forms are plotted
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HaCaT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, the protein
          levels of both forms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> were significantly
          decreased after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hrs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP7</TIMEX> treatment and were almost
          diminished by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> hrs. Interestingly, a different response
          was observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L6</NUMEX> cells. The levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> were
          somewhat increased after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hrs and peaked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> hrs, but
          then started to decline at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> hrs and were diminished at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22 hrs.</TIMEX>
        
        
          SNIP1 is a nuclear repressor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> responses
          To determine the functional significance of the
          observed SNIP1 degradation induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>, we tested the
          role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNIP1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX>-regulated gene responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>.
          We first tested the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced
          activation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tlx2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, which involves Smad1 [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> length SNIP1 exhibits dose-dependent
          inhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced gene activation, as
          monitored by the luciferase activities (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A). Thus,
          SNIP1 is an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced gene response. Since
          we have previously shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> and inhibits
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> via its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , the deletion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant of SNIP1</ENAMEX> lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> binding site, SNIP1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">142-369</ENAMEX>), was tested in the same assay. SNIP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">142-369</ENAMEX>)
          exhibits little inhibitory activity towards the gene
          response (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A, see ΔN-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SNIP1</NUMEX>). This data further
          suggests that the inhibitory activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is
          mediated by its interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p300</ENAMEX>, similar to
          what has been reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . We
          next tested the inhibitory activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> on the
          transcriptional activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX>-Smad1
          and GAL4-Luc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> system, as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . SNIP1 inhibited BMP-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of
          GAL4-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p19</NUMEX> cells transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL4-Smad1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          9B). The proteasome specific inhibitor lactacystin also
          inhibited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-induced GAL4-Smad1</ENAMEX> transcriptional
          activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B), consistent with a role of proteasomal
          degradation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX>-mediated transcription. The effect
          of lactacystin is specific, since the control reporter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene β-Gal</ENAMEX> was not inhibited by lactacystin (data not
          shown). In a separate study, we also demonstrated that
          proteasomal degradation also plays an essential role in
          BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced dendritic</ENAMEX> formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> sympathetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) are
        multi-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of early embryogenesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue/organ morphogenesis.</ENAMEX> Observations made in the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> suggest that a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smad</ENAMEX> family proteins
        play key roles in transmitting the signals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> from the
        activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at the cell surface to the nucleus to
        regulate gene expression. Smad1, as one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> known
        R-Smads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>, has been extensively studied within the
        scope of its phosphorylation, interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>,
        nuclear translocation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding</ENAMEX> and protein-protein
        interactions related to its function as a transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> is regarded as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        transcriptional modulator that is activated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> type
        I <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Considering the sophisticated mode of
        regulation characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β/BMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> ligands,
        it is expected that that signaling mechanisms of Smads
        should have a nature of complexity that can accommodate the
        vast biological functions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. We took a
        discovery-driven approach to study the signaling mechanism
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, by systematically searching for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can
        physically interact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. Such an approach led to the
        identification of a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can specifically
        bind to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. This report has focused upon the functional
        characterization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that function along the
        degradation pathways of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome: antizyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX>)
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX>.
        Az was previously identified as a polyamine-inducible
        factor that binds and targets the ornithine decarboxylase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX>) to proteasome for degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 45</NUMEX> ] . Until now,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> known to be targeted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> to
        proteasome, although the existence of additional proteins
        targeted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> to proteasome has been suspected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . We
        now find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Az</ENAMEX> interactors: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX>, the key signal
        transducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX>, the nuclear repressor
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300.</ENAMEX> In a separate study, we demonstrated that
        Smad1 is targeted to proteasome for degradation, a process
        involving the co-targeting role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        Here we showed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX>, after being recruited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX>, is
        targeted, together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, to proteasome for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. These data indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> has a more general
        role in targeting different substrates to proteasome for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. However, unlike the known ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bind ODC</ENAMEX> constitutively, the interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> is dependent upon the activation of BMP type I receptor
        and occurs in the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and Smad4</TIMEX>. This
        suggests the existence of a novel BMP-regulated
        "conditional" targeting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> that is distinct
        from the constitutive targeting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODC</ENAMEX>.
        HsN3 is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> β subunits of the 20S
        proteasome, which is the catalytic core of the 26S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Besides its role as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indispensable</ENAMEX> component of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and the
        α subunit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HC9 of the 20S</TIMEX> proteasome have been shown to
        interact with the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Tax. This interaction was
        suggested to play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax-induced</ENAMEX> proteasomal
        processing of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P105</NUMEX> subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Other
        proteasome integral components, especially those in the 19S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome, have also been shown to
        bring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to proteasome for degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Here
        we identified a unique role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Az</ENAMEX>-involved
        targeting pathway that is coupled to BMP type I receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Our data suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> both
        interact with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">HsN3 only</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> is fully incorporated
        into the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20S</TIMEX> proteasome. We have shown that the
        reason for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> to only bind to the unprocessed form of
        HsN3 is not because the prosequence contains a
        Smad1-binding site. Artificially removing the prosequence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> in fact allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX> to stably bind to the
        prosequence-less HsN3 as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are
        bound to the prosequence-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less HsN3</NUMEX>, which may represent the
        assembly intermediates that failed to reach maturation due
        to the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prosequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,4F</ENAMEX>). These data
        collectively point out the transient interaction between
        Smad1 and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HsN3</NUMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> into the 20S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX>. So far, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been found to
        interact with assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intermediates</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome.
        A small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Ump1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the premature
        proteasome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and is shown to be involved in
        assisting the maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX>, possibly by
        interacting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">β</ENAMEX> rings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> proteasomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        Upon the maturation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ump1</ENAMEX> is trapped
        inside the proteasome and is degraded by proteasome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ]
        . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HSP70</NUMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaperon protein Hsc73</ENAMEX> also associates
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> proteasome precursor complexes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . The
        exact role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsc73</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> precursor proteasome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        not known, but has been suggested to assist proteasome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . Our studies add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Smad1</NUMEX>, Smad1
        interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad4</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> as
        additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that associate with the assembly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX>. How does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> contribute
        to the final degradation or processing of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>?
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> possible mechanisms are illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10A. The
        first possible mechanism is via "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unfold and Trap"</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">proteasome</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intermediates</ENAMEX> could be a site for the
        entry of substrates into the degradation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> via an
        unfold-trap mechanism that is coupled to the final
        maturation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20S</NUMEX> proteasome. The chaperon proteins
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsc73</ENAMEX> could be involved in unfolding the substrates
        for them to fit into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">degradation chamber</ENAMEX> and the final
        maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> assembly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX> could trap the substrates, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ump1</ENAMEX> and
        Smads, inside the degradation chamber. If so,
        ubiquitination may not be necessary for the degradation.
        This could be a common mechanism for ubiquitin-independent
        degradation pathways. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possible mechanism is via
        "docking and delivery". HsN3 may simply bring the Smad/Az
        containing complex close enough to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> proteasome and
        then delivers it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">19S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> interaction with
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> within 19S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>.
        We have so far identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functional outcomes of the
        observed physical interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in
        the signaling pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>. First, in a separate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, we showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> itself is targeted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome,
        an event that is triggered by the activation of BMP type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and involves the targeting role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] . Proteasomal degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> appears to also
        play a role in regulating the constitutive level of Smad1
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> as a way to adjust the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">responsiveness</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . However, the targeting mechanism and the
        regulation involved in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases of Smad1 degradation
        by proteasome are likely fundamentally different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> functional outcome of the physical link between
        Smad1, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> is the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1</NUMEX> to regulate the
        proteasomal degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX>, which is clearly
        dependent upon high levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and a strong
        activation signal from the type I receptor, as suggested by
        the observations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and
        ALK3Q233D directly influence the degree of SNIP1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. While the detailed mechanisms for such a novel
        mode of regulation still requires many additional studies,
        so far we observed several important steps that may
        contribute to SNIP1 degradation. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad1</ENAMEX> binds both
        HsN3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm and brings them into the
        nucleus upon the activation of BMP type I receptor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is recruited to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsN3</ENAMEX>, which are
        likely in a complex with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1 and Smad4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7D& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7E</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is co-targeted into the proteasome with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>,
        Smad4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Az</ENAMEX> via the rapid assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsN3</ENAMEX> into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX>. This is suggested by the observations that the
        targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is positively regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> level
        and is dependent upon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Az</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A&
        8B). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> is a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the targeting
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SNIP1</NUMEX> to proteasome. The requirement of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and
        Smad4 in the down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is interesting since
        this may represent an important molecular mechanism for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-operative</ENAMEX> property of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> to modulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. The functional significance of SNIP1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> is apparent, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> is a constitutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactor</ENAMEX> and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repressor</ENAMEX> of the master
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcription</ENAMEX> co-activator <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In the BMP
        signaling pathways, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> is a potent inhibitor of
        Smad-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> via inhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A).
        Thus the down-regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> likely leads to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> and directly contributes to the
        well-known transcriptional modulator functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and
        Smad4. These ideas are summarized in a cartoon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10B.
        Specifically, the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> enter the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad4</ENAMEX> together recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNIP1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300.</ENAMEX> The inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNIP1</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> is considered
        to act through its interaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/H1</ENAMEX> domain of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300</ENAMEX>, thereby blocking the recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CBP</ENAMEX>/p300 by
        other transcription factors including Smad4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Such
        an inhibition is counteracted by the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad4</NUMEX> to
        compete off SNIP1 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p300</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . So at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> phase
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smad</ENAMEX> activation, although SNIP1 is still bound to Smad1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX>, it is no longer directly bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300,</ENAMEX>
        which now can activate transcription. Our data suggested
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smad1/Smad4 bound SNIP1</ENAMEX> can be further targeted to
        proteasome for degradation. Smad1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> are indeed both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degraded</ENAMEX>. However, we propose that such degradation is
        coupled to the recruitment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SNIP1</NUMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> to a
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding transcription factor, thus carrying out
        the commonly observed role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> as transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-modulators. Smads have been shown to mediate
        transcription via modulating the transcriptional activity
        of many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX>. The ability of Smad1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad4</ENAMEX> to target SNIP1 for degradation, thereby freeing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> for other transcriptional factors is likely an
        important mechanism for the transcriptional modulator role
        of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX>.
        We have observed that several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smad1 interactors</ENAMEX>,
        including some cytoplasmic interactors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>, are also
        degraded by proteasome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        Thus, the location for the targeting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> may not be
        limited to only inside of the nucleus, as illustrated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10B. Future studies are needed to verify and enrich
        the details of the illustrated molecular events.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The subject of proteasomal degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> and Smad
        interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has now become a major focus of
        interest in the field due to its broad implication in
        signaling regulation and execution. The work reported here
        represents our major efforts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>
        to follow a novel concept of proteasomal degradation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β/BMP</ENAMEX> signaling based upon the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid data
        obtained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. Although there are multiple reports on
        proteasomal degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smad</ENAMEX> interacting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, primarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β signaling pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51 52 53 54</NUMEX> ] , our observations reported here are
        entirely based upon our own original observations and show
        a novel connection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX> with the proteasome system that
        no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have reported. Our observations provide new
        revenues for future understanding of the functional
        mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smads</ENAMEX>, which are likely not limited to
        transcriptional regulation but are quite extensively linked
        to the regulation of proteasomal degradation of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Construction of expression plasmids
          For the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screen, full-length Smad1 was
          subcloned into <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BamH1/Not1</ENAMEX> sites of PEG202 by a PCR
          method, resulting in the inframe fusion between the LexA
          DNA binding domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-202</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The Smad1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G419S</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> was a kind gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Wrana</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The
          subcloning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G419S</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1NL</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-271</ENAMEX>), Smad1L
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">147-271</ENAMEX>) into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pEG202</TIMEX> were all carried out similarly by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach. The mammalian expression constructs of
          Smad1 and its deletion mutant Smad1C (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">271-465</ENAMEX>) were made
          by subcloning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad1</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> modified pCMV6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX>,
          which have either the Flag epitope (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-pCMV6</ENAMEX>) or the T7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7-pCMV6</ENAMEX>) placed upstream of an array of new
          multiple cloning sites. T7<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-ΔN3 pCMV6</ENAMEX> was made by PCR
          amplification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (a.a. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-263</NUMEX>) followed by
          subcloning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products into the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">EcoR1/Xho1</ENAMEX> sites of
          the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7-pCMV6</ENAMEX> vector. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N3-F pCMV6</ENAMEX> was made by PCR
          amplification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsN3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-263</ENAMEX>) followed by subcloning the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoR1/EcoRV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of pFlag-CMV5C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>). The fidelity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products was
          determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX>. The constitutively active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant BMP</ENAMEX> type I receptor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ALK3Q233D</NUMEX>) is a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>

          Yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screen and tests
          A modified yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . was used to isolate Smad1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactors</ENAMEX>. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> strain EGY48 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leu2, his3,</ENAMEX>
          trp1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ura3</TIMEX>), which has an integrated Leu2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, was
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transformed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LexAop</ENAMEX>-LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>. The
          selected transformants were transformed again with the
          bait construct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1pEG202</NUMEX>. The selected bait
          transformants were transformed with a human fetal brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Brent</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one million</NUMEX>
          original transformants were obtained. From the pooled
          stock of the transformants, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten million</NUMEX> cells were
          screened on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U -H -W -L</ENAMEX> -galactose plates containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-Gal
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactosidase</ENAMEX>). Only
          those that form blue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were picked as candidate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>. The cDNAs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> positives were
          purified, re-tested for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad1</TIMEX> interaction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and
          then sequenced. For testing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
          using the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system, the same yeast strain
          was first transformed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LexA</ENAMEX>-fusion construct,
          selected on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> -H -plates, then re-transformed with
          B42-fusion constructs, and selected on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U -H -W</ENAMEX> -plates.
          The transformants were first streaked onto a master
          plate, then replicated onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> testing plates: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U -H -W</ENAMEX>
          -glucose plate with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-Gal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U -H -W</ENAMEX>
          -galactose/raffinose plate with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-Gal</ENAMEX>. For presentation,
          yeast transformants were also directly streaked onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> -H
          -W -galactose/raffinose plate with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-Gal</ENAMEX>, after
          confirming lack of the auto-activation on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>.

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> construct was used to monitor the
          transfection efficiency. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells were transfected by
          the standard CaPO

          Luciferase assays
          P19 cells were seeded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> and cultured for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hrs</TIMEX> before they were transfected with luciferase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter constructs</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fugene Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>). Each group
          of transfected cells was re-seeded into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wells</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well plate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> hrs after transfection.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> hrs after re-seeding, cells were washed twice
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml serum-free media and left in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> μl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> dishes of each group were exposed to BMP7
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25 ng/ml BMP7</ENAMEX>), which was directly added into the media
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hrs.</TIMEX> Culture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was then removed and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μl</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reporter Lysis Buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5X</ENAMEX> stock, diluted with H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) was added to the cells, which
          were then frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hrs. The plates were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thawed</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 μl</NUMEX> of supernatant was transferred to
          luciferase plates, mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 μl</NUMEX> of luciferase reagent
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>). The luciferase activity was detected on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallac</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX> plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>. To normalize data, cells were
          also transfected with β-Gal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and the
          β-galactosidase activities measured using the
          Galacto-star kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropix</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BM300S</TIMEX>).
