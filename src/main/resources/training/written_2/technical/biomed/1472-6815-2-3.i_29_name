        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        experience chronic tinnitus; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 million</NUMEX> of these people
        consider their tinnitus to be a significant problem [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazell</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> has chronic tinnitus, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14%</NUMEX> of those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> experiencing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tinnitus</ENAMEX> said that it bothers them a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal. Innumerable treatments for this condition have
        been utilized - with varying degrees of success - by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The goal of effective tinnitus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is not necessarily to mask or remove the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s physical perception of tinnitus sounds. In many
        cases this is not even possible. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duckro et al</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , "the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more
        accurately described in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> rather than
        cure." Several studies have demonstrated that the matched
        loudness of tinnitus is not correlated with its severity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Tinnitus severity can be defined and quantified several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>: by how much or how often a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is bothered by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX>; by how much or how often tinnitus detracts from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s enjoyment of life; or by how disabling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> perceive their tinnitus to be. Various instruments
        have been developed to assess tinnitus severity. These
        include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Handicap</ENAMEX>
        Inventory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Regardless of which assessment instrument
        is used, the goal of tinnitus management programs should be
        to reduce the severity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s tinnitus. That is,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> should help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to learn how to pay less
        attention to their tinnitus so that it bothers them less of
        the time. A realistic goal of an effective tinnitus
        management program is to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> understand and gain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over their tinnitus, rather than tinnitus having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over them. Ultimately clinicians should strive to
        help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> progress to the point where tinnitus is no
        longer a negative factor in their lives.
        Many studies have been undertaken to assess the
        effectiveness of tinnitus management programs or methods.
        Some of these studies assessed tinnitus severity before
        treatment was initiated and assessed it again immediately
        after the treatment program was concluded [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Other studies included a follow-up assessment of tinnitus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">severity</ENAMEX> (usually in the form of a questionnaire) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , three
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] after the conclusion of
        a treatment program.
        Few studies of the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tinnitus</ENAMEX> treatments have
        assessed their longer-term effects on tinnitus severity.
        This is an important point to consider because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        perception of their tinnitus often changes with time. For
        example, in their study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] made the following observations: discomfort
        from tinnitus and reported loudness of tinnitus increased;
        however, tolerance to tinnitus improved as the time from
        tinnitus onset increased.
        The importance of long-term follow-up assessment is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the results of a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindberg et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . This investigation assessed tinnitus severity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX> after they had completed a relaxation
        / distraction counseling program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] had
        published the effects of this treatment program on these
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> based on assessments administered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-treatment</ENAMEX> and again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> after the conclusion of
        counseling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott et al</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> improved
        significantly in discomfort and irritation from tinnitus as
        well as in depression and reported loudness of tinnitus.
        However, based on results from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nine-month</TIMEX> follow-up
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindberg et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] reported that
        significant improvement remained for only "discomfort from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>' follow-up responses to the other
        severity measures were no longer significantly different
        from pre-treatment values.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesterager</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] mailed questionnaires to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> tinnitus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.5 to 4.5 years</TIMEX> (median = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.2 years</TIMEX>) after they
        attended an audiology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>. The treatment
        program included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> education and reassurance,
        psychological counseling, hearing aids and maskers as
        appropriate. Tinnitus severity was evaluated prior to the
        initiation of treatment by scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' responses in
        several areas of complaint including sleep problems,
        quality of life, concentration problems, sensitivity to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, irritability, and fear of serious illness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        also rated the loudness of their tinnitus. When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-treatment</ENAMEX> responses were compared to those from
        follow-up questionnaires, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesterager</ENAMEX> reported that the most
        severely afflicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed significant improvements
        in getting to sleep, concentration, and self-rated loudness
        of tinnitus.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanchez & Stephens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-60</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after they attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Clinic</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
        Hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reported more
        benefits (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8</NUMEX> per respondent) than shortcomings (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respondent</ENAMEX>) regarding their attendance at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>.
        Specific benefits reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included being
        fitted with a hearing aid or tinnitus masker; positive
        characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>; and the opportunity to
        discuss tinnitus with informed clinicians. Specific
        shortcomings included patient perceptions that clinic
        treatments were ineffective and the persistence of
        problematic tinnitus after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> attendance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersson et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] used questionnaires to assess
        tinnitus distress and the effects of cognitive behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapy</ENAMEX> (CBT) in a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-10 years</TIMEX> (average =
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.9 years</TIMEX>) after they attended a series of appointments at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uppsala University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>. A majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>) of patients
        who received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBT</ENAMEX> exhibited reductions in tinnitus-related
        distress over time. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' tolerance of
        tinnitus increased between the time of their initial
        appointment and the follow-up questionnaire. Maskability of
        tinnitus at admission was a predictor of tinnitus-related
        distress at follow-up.
        The present study was undertaken for the following
        reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to assess long-term changes in tinnitus
        severity exhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who completed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> tinnitus management program; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to identify
        factors that contributed to changes in tinnitus severity
        within this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) to contribute to the development
        and refinement of effective assessment and management
        procedures for tinnitus.
      
      
        Methods
        Detailed questionnaires were mailed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> consecutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> prior to their initial appointment at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health & Science University Tinnitus Clinic</ENAMEX> between
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-2001</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">questionnaires</ENAMEX> requested information about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' medical, hearing, and tinnitus histories [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix</ENAMEX> contains twelve questions that constitute the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 24</ENAMEX> ] , an efficient indicator
        of the negative impacts of tinnitus upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (see
        Appendix, additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An abbreviated version of the
        Beck <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression Inventory</ENAMEX> (aBDI) was also included [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> rated the loudness of their usual tinnitus on a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-to-10</NUMEX> scale (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix</ENAMEX>, additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Information from these questionnaires was entered into a
        database known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Tinnitus Data Registry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        .

        The initial appointment at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> had the following
        format:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Management Team</ENAMEX> (composed of an
        otolaryngologist, a neurophysiologist, and an audiologist)
        reviewed questionnaires and medical records prior to
        meeting each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> met with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management Team members</ENAMEX> for an
        in-depth interview and review of their medical, hearing,
        tinnitus, and psychosocial histories and conditions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> received education about possible causes of
        tinnitus as well as reassurance and counseling regarding
        factors that could exacerbate or improve their
        condition.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otolaryngological</ENAMEX> and neurological examinations.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) Audiological evaluations including pure tone air and
        bone conduction thresholds; speech perception in quiet and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noise; MCL/UCL</ENAMEX>; tympanometry.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) Tinnitus evaluations that included matching tinnitus
        to sounds played through headphones; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        minimum masking levels; measurements of residual inhibition
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> for a description of these
        procedures).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) Evaluations of acoustic therapies: based on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s audiological evaluations, various <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">devices</ENAMEX> were
        described and demonstrated. These could include hearing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aids</ENAMEX>, in-the-ear sound generators, tinnitus instruments
        (combinations of hearing aids + sound generators), tabletop
        sound generation machines, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound Pillows</ENAMEX>, tapes or CDs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Management Team</ENAMEX> reviewed the results of
        evaluations and explained them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) Recommendations were formulated and explained to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Referral</ENAMEX> and contact information regarding medical
        or psychiatric evaluations, psychological counseling, and
        other recommended services or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> was also
        provided.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) Follow-up: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were encouraged contact the
        clinic anytime if they had questions and also to inform us
        of their progress. If they did not call us <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, we
        contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by telephone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one and three months</TIMEX> after
        their initial appointment.
        Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 36 months</TIMEX> after their initial
        appointment.
        These protocols were reviewed and approved by the
        Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health & Science</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>. Informed consent was obtained in writing from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> prior to their participation in this study.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> relating to patient demographics, audiometric
        thresholds, self-rated (according to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-to-10</NUMEX> scale in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>, additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) tinnitus loudness,
        tinnitus severity, sleep interference, and aBDI scores were
        analyzed (mean values were calculated and compared using
        analyses of variance and paired, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed t-tests).
      
      
        Results
        
          Tinnitus duration
          At the time of their initial appointment, patients
          reported that their tinnitus had been present for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">durations</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Audiometric data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2contains</ENAMEX> the grand averaged pure tone air
          conduction thresholds for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who returned
          follow-up questionnaires. This pattern of high frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensorineural</ENAMEX> hearing loss is typical for our clinic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 90%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are
          evaluated in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> have some degree of hearing loss.
          The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> traditionally had a greater amount of
          noise exposure (in military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, in the workplace,
          and during recreational activities) contributes to the
          higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> in the present study and in
          our general tinnitus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (â‰<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">¥70%</NUMEX> in both
          cases).
        
        
          Self-rated loudness of tinnitus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3contains</ENAMEX> means, standard deviations, and a
          statistical comparison (paired, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed t-test) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' ratings of the loudness of their tinnitus on
          the initial and follow-up questionnaires. There was a
          statistically significant reduction in self-rated
          tinnitus loudness at the time of the follow-up
          questionnaire compared to the initial questionnaire.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index scores
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3also</ENAMEX> contains means, standard deviations, and
          statistical comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' responses to twelve
          questions that comprise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index. A
          repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was
          performed on these data to control for the number of
          comparisons as well as for the fact that the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> responded to both the initial and follow-up
          questions. The overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilks' Lambda</ENAMEX> F value was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.29</NUMEX>
          with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>. This indicated that there was a
          significant change in responses on the follow-up
          questionnaire and allowed us to proceed with univariate
          tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values resulting from univariate comparisons of
          initial and follow-up responses to each of the twelve
          tinnitus severity questions are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Using
          an alpha of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction produced a
          significance level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.004</NUMEX> for each of these items.
          According to the statistical criteria outlined in the
          previous paragraph, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the present study
          reported significant improvement in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> of the twelve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index questions. The only question that
          did not exhibit significant change was "Does your
          tinnitus make it uncomfortable to be in a quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>?"
          Consequently, this group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibited a
          significant reduction in total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity Index</ENAMEX>
          score between the time of their initial clinic
          appointment and the follow-up questionnaire.
        
        
          Sleep interference
          Table 4contains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' responses to the question
          "Does your tinnitus interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sleep?</ENAMEX>" on both the
          initial and follow-up questionnaires. Compared to the
          initial questionnaire, there was a significant increase
          in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not experience sleep
          interference at the time of follow-up (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.92</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX> (that is, from "often" to "sometimes" or

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.5%</NUMEX>) stayed the same on initial and follow-up

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> whose sleep patterns did not change exhibited a

          However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose
          sleep patterns worsened did not change significantly. In
          fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index scores for those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> tended to be higher at the time of follow-up

          Mean aBDI scores for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the present study
          were as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.16 Â± 5.32</NUMEX> on the initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.91 Â± 6.55</NUMEX> at follow-up. According to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck & Beck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , a score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> on this version
          of their Inventory can indicate mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. In the
          present study, there was no significant change in aBDI
          scores for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.7%</NUMEX>)
          reported that they were experiencing depression at the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.2%</NUMEX>) reported that they were experiencing
          depression at the time of the follow-up questionnaire.
          This is a significant reduction in the number of patients

          the initial questionnaire and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.54</NUMEX> on the follow-up
          questionnaire. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck & Beck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , this
          indicates group improvement from moderate depression to

        Discussion
        
          Patient education, reassurance, and demystification
          of tinnitus
          During their initial clinic appointment, all patients
          received information about the most likely cause of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX> and about factors that can either exacerbate or
          improve the condition. A better understanding of the
          mechanisms of tinnitus and a review of effective
          management strategies can reduce anxiety associated with
          the "fear of the unknown" experienced by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus</ENAMEX> education provided a great deal of
          reassurance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Medical examinations and tests
          provided additional reassurance that their tinnitus was
          not a symptom of a degenerative or potentially fatal
          condition. The process of patient education and
          reassurance helps to demystify tinnitus and can
          facilitate a reduction in the severity of this symptom.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanchez & Stephens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          reported that the "opportunity to discuss tinnitus with
          informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>" was one of the most beneficial aspects of
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> appointment.
        
        
          Acoustic therapy
          Acoustic therapy is 
          using external sounds to provide relief
          or distraction from tinnitus . This is a vital
          component of an effective tinnitus management program.
          All of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> use acoustic therapy in one or more
          of its forms.
          There are numerous techniques and devices that can
          help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to increase their exposure to safe and
          pleasant external sounds in order to decrease their
          awareness of tinnitus. This strategy has multiple
          advantages and benefits:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢ Acoustic</ENAMEX> therapy is non-invasive and has no adverse
          side effects.
          â€¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> often obtain immediate relief from - or
          reduced perception of - their tinnitus.
          â€¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> can use external sounds to exert some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over their tinnitus. This often results in
          reduced patient frustration and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>.
          â€¢ Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experience residual inhibition:
          tinnitus suppression or temporary disappearance following
          exposure to external sounds.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢ Acoustic</ENAMEX> therapy can facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">habituation</ENAMEX> to tinnitus. That is, increasing the level of
          external sounds within safe limits can help patients
          learn to pay less attention to their tinnitus. If
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tinnitus</ENAMEX> becomes less noticeable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will be
          bothered by it less of the time.
          â€¢ Increased exposure to external sounds (within safe
          limits) increases blood flow throughout the auditory
          system. This helps to nourish and maintain auditory
          structures and might also contribute to healing processes
          when possible.
          â€¢ Increased exposure to external sounds over time
          could contribute to reorganizations of neural pathways
          responsible for tinnitus generation and perception.
          Reductions of superfluous activity within the central
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">auditory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> might result in permanent reductions in
          tinnitus perception.
          Depending on test results and individual preferences,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can increase the level of pleasant sounds in any
          environment by using hearing aids, in-the-ear sound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generators</ENAMEX>, tinnitus instruments (combinations of hearing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aids</ENAMEX> + sound generators), tabletop sound generation
          machines, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound Pillows</ENAMEX>, tapes or CDs.
        
        
          Improvements in sleep patterns
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> whose sleep patterns improved at least one
          category exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX>
          Index score on the follow-up questionnaire. Improvements
          in sleep patterns experienced by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          attributable to several factors: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>; additions
          of pleasant sounds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>; reduced anxiety;
          improved coping strategies, attention-switching, and
          relaxation techniques; and psychological counseling. When
          appropriate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with insomnia were advised to talk
          with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> about the occasional use of
          over-the-counter or prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that might
          improve their sleep patterns. In cases of severe and
          persistent insomnia that did not improve by
          implementation of our recommendations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          referred to specialized sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> for evaluation and
          treatment. The fact that improvements in sleep
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interference</ENAMEX> contributed to improvements in overall
          ratings of tinnitus severity underscores the importance
          of identifying and effectively treating insomnia.
        
        
          Psychological counseling
          Some directive counseling occurred during the initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> appointment including advice about relaxation and
          attention-switching techniques, and identification of
          problems (including insomnia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, anxiety,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, anger, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies) that
          might require long-term psychotherapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who would
          benefit from ongoing psychotherapy were referred to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> near their home. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Andersson</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that cognitive behavioral
          therapy can help to reduce tinnitus-related distress for
          a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> and depression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who reported high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or anxiety
          were referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> for
          evaluation and treatment. In the present study, patients
          exhibited significant reductions in tinnitus-related
          anxiety as reflected by their responses to the following
          questions on initial and follow-up questionnaires (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 3</ENAMEX>): Does your tinnitus make you feel irritable or
          nervous? Does your tinnitus make you feel tired or
          stressed? Does your tinnitus make it difficult for you to
          relax?
          Psychiatric evaluations were recommended a) for all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who reported current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>; b) for patients
          who scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> or higher on the aBDI at the time of their
          initial appointment. Ongoing psychotherapy was also
          recommended for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Even though there was no
          significant change in mean aBDI scores for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as a
          whole, there was a significant reduction in the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who reported current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> at the time of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44</NUMEX>) compared to the initial clinic appointment
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">64</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> whose initial aBDI scores decreased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> points on the follow-up questionnaire exhibited a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinnitus Severity</ENAMEX> Index scores. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          whose initial aBDI scores increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 or more</NUMEX> points on
          the follow-up questionnaire did not exhibit any
          significant changes in tinnitus severity. These results
          underscore the importance of identifying and effectively
          treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.
          Previous studies demonstrated that tinnitus severity
          is positively correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' degree of
          depression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , insomnia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Effective treatment of these co-symptoms with
          psychological counseling in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
          often reduces the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' tinnitus. A
          common question is: "Did improvements in insomnia,
          anxiety and depression lead to improvements in tinnitus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">severity</ENAMEX>, or did a reduction in tinnitus severity
          precipitate improvements in these co-symptoms<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" Halford
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">& Anderson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] gave an excellent answer to this
          chicken-and-egg conundrum: "It is considered that the
          causal relationship between these psychological variables
          and tinnitus severity is likely to be
          bi-directional."
        
        
          Lifestyle changes
          Based on findings from questionnaires, patient
          interviews and testing, specific recommendations were
          made to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> regarding the following:
          recreational and occupational noise exposure;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>; diet; exercise; employment; socialization;
          acoustic therapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were referred to other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> for evaluation and treatment when
          necessary.
        
        
          Follow-up
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were encouraged to contact the tinnitus
          clinic any time during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">business hours</TIMEX> if they had
          questions or concerns. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who ordered in-the-ear
          devices required follow-up appointments for fittings and
          adjustments. If we did not hear from them <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, we
          called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> after
          their initial appointment. Follow-up questionnaires were
          mailed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> after their
          initial appointment. Additional questionnaires are
          sometimes sent to patients <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>.
          Clinician-initiated contact at regular intervals after
          the initial appointment is important for several
          reasons:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â·</ENAMEX> to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> know that clinicians are committed
          to helping them
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â·</ENAMEX> to address <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' questions or concerns
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â·</ENAMEX> to check <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' compliance with
          recommendations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â·</ENAMEX> to modify recommendations or to suggest different
          strategies when necessary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â·</ENAMEX> to assess the effectiveness of the tinnitus
          management program
          We reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that recommendations made to them
          at the conclusion of their initial appointment in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> are starting points. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> follows all of
          the initial recommendations and yet the severity of his
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX> does not improve over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>,
          we either suggested different strategies for him to try
          or asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-evaluation</ENAMEX> and additional counseling. Different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX> and tinnitus management strategies might be
          described or demonstrated during the follow-up
          appointment. Particular recommendations were then
          reinforced or modified.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Identification and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing
        anxiety, insomnia or depression are vital components of an
        effective tinnitus management program. Utilization of
        acoustic therapy also contributed to improvements exhibited
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the present study. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Individualized</ENAMEX> treatment
        programs that were designed for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> contributed to
        the overall improvement in tinnitus severity reported on
        follow-up questionnaires. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> agree that a
        combination of tinnitus management strategies is more
        effective than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> form of remediation used in isolation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 27 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Even though a customized combination of
        recommendations is effective for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic
        and bothersome tinnitus, the process can be very time
        consuming. The time required for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> assessment,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, reassurance, and counseling, as well as for
        designing and initiating an individualized tinnitus
        management program can take more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> during the
        initial appointment. Follow-up appointments can last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or more. Most family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and otolaryngologists
        are not able to spend even a small fraction of this much
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> during an office visit. If a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX> has assessed and treated every reasonable medical
        cause for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s tinnitus, and the patient reports
        little improvement in tinnitus severity, the clinician
        should refer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to a comprehensive tinnitus
        management program with experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> who are
        willing and able to spend a substantial amount of time with
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Because chronic tinnitus has several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and co-symptoms in common with chronic
        pain, pain management strategies can be effective for some
        tinnitus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 32</ENAMEX> ] .
