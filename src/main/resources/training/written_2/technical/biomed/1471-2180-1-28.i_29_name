        Despite tremendous progress in developing
        anti-retroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to combat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, there remains a need
        for an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. This need is particularly
        pressing in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, where demographics and
        economics make drug therapy difficult to deliver. Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection elicits neutralizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and a
        cellular immune response against the virus [reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] & [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ] and there exist "exposed uninfected" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that appear to have acquired resistance to
        infection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , the hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection is
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX> universal inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to mount an immune
        response that can prevent the eventual development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>.
        An effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> will require not only the design of
        effective immunogens, but also the design of optimized
        protocols of immunogen delivery. As a live, attenuated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> is considered difficult to test and
        dangerous to implement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] , various
        alternatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> could be considered as potential "live"
        vectors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV immunogens</ENAMEX>, including enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poxviruses</ENAMEX> (vaccinia and canarypox), small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> viruses
        (e.g. poliovirus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semliki Forest</ENAMEX> virus), Rhabdoviruses
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">e.g. vesicular stomatitis</ENAMEX> virus), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenovirus</ENAMEX> and adeno-associated viruses) and even naked DNA
        to achieve expression in living host cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dengue</ENAMEX> possesses several advantages which favor its
        choice as a vector for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV immunogens</ENAMEX>. As a flavivirus, it
        replicates entirely in the cytoplasm through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerization</ENAMEX> and is incapable of integrating into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host genome</ENAMEX>. Flavivirus replicons can replicate inside
        cells and achieve prolonged expression of high levels of
        virally encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with minimal toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ]
        and are unable to recombine or mutate to produce infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV particles</ENAMEX>. Finally, by eliciting an immune reaction
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> non-structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> remaining in
        replicons, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus replicons may induce a protective
        immunity against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> which would not predispose
        vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHF</ENAMEX>. Properly administered,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue virus replicons expressing HIV epitopes</ENAMEX> might thus
        serve as dual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, conferring protection against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
        The challenges in developing a safe and effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> are many and varied. Choice of immunogen is clearly
        problematic. Critical epitopes may be masked by glycosyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> and/or tertiary structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        The extensive genetic variability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> complicates
        immunogen choice and the high rate of mutation increases
        the likelihood of the rapid development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, the method of immunogen delivery (e.g.
        purified subunits or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inactivated</ENAMEX> virus vs. various forms of
        "live" expression) can determine the relative nature and
        extent of humoral and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> mediated immunologic responses.
        Priming with various types of "live" expression followed by
        boosting with purified subunits is currently favored as a
        method to obtain stronger immunologic responses that either
        method alone [reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ]. Previously
        acquired immunity to a viral vector such as vaccinia may
        influence its efficacy in inducing immunity against
        heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being delivered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] and
        it may be wise to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>
        based on a variety of vectors to handle a variety of
        clinical situations.
        The use of live <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or as a vector for
        heterologous immunogens has historically been considered
        problematic because of the pathologies associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> infection. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue fever</ENAMEX> (DF) is usually
        self limited, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue hemorrhagic fever</ENAMEX> (DHF) is
        considerably debilitating and frequently fatal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHF</ENAMEX> is unlikely to result from or be promoted by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> reported here. The enhanced replication of
        virus seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue hemorrhagic fever</ENAMEX> is generally seen
        upon reinfection by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus of a serotype different
        from previous infections and is believed to be mediated by
        antibodies against viral structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: so called
        antibody dependent enhancement of infection, or ADE. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> reacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> actually promote viral uptake by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . The main challenge in using live
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is thus avoiding the development of
        antibody dependent enhancement(ADE) of infection by
        antibodies against the pre-M and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dengue
        strain which weakly cross react with the pre-M and E of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> infecting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> strain. Since the replicons
        reported here lack the major viral structural protein
        genes, they are not only incapable of sustaining a
        spreading infection but also are incapable of eliciting
        antibodies against the missing structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. They
        should neither induce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> nor promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHF</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dengue</ENAMEX> virus has a typical flavivirus genome structure,
        as described in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, C, pre-M
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) and E, are involved in packaging, export and subsequent
        entry. The non-structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS2A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS2B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS3</TIMEX>,
        NS4A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS4B and NS5</TIMEX> include an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-directed RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
        and a protease function involved in cleaving certain
        positions of the long viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyprotein</ENAMEX> which contains all
        the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> serotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"1</ENAMEX>" through "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">4"</ENAMEX>) share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%-74%</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX> identity with one another in the E gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        and induce cross-reacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> strategies suggest themselves for circumventing the
        problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADE</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue vaccination</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strategy is to
        immunize with multiple strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus to elicit
        high affinity, neutralizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against the multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue serotypes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> to do this (using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DEN-1 PDK13</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DEN-2 PDK53</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEN-3</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">30/F3</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DEN-4 PDK48</ENAMEX>) has been in clinical trials [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strategy is to induce immunity only to
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than pre-M and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.</ENAMEX> Several studies have
        shown that the nonstructural glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NS1</ENAMEX> can play an
        important role in protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> immunized
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">purified dengue</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> NS1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> injected intramuscularly
        and boosted after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> were protected from
        developing lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> encephalitis upon subsequent
        challenge with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> virus. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        immunized with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">recombinant vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">authentic NS1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] were protected against the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> virus encephalitis when challenged by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracerebral</ENAMEX> injection. Inoculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with specific
        combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabs</ENAMEX>) directed
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> NS1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] also protects against lethal
        virus encephalitis upon intracerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>-2 challenge.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonstructural proteins</ENAMEX> are also immunogenic and may
        participate in eliciting protection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Previously we have reported the successful construction
        of several <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue virus replicons</ENAMEX> which replicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellularly</ENAMEX> without the pre-M and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> required
        to form infectious virions, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> replicon which
        can be expressed from transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Towards the
        goal of devising a "live" dual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> based on only
        non-structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dengue proteins</ENAMEX> and heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        material, we report here that these replicons can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harnessed</ENAMEX> to express heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        gp160 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX>. Upon introduction into a host's cells,
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-genomic</ENAMEX> fragments should replicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellularly</ENAMEX> and support prolonged expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        and heterologous immunogens without producing the deleted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and without forming infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virions</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        In various previous attempts to express heterologous
        genes in full length, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type dengue</ENAMEX> virus, we
        experienced a very poor success rate, despite attempts to
        clone heterologous material into various positions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> efforts to determine
        whether or not heterologous material could be readily
        expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX> was to clone the
        comparatively tractable green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP)
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Δpre-M</ENAMEX>/E replicon, into the position from which
        the pre-M and E genes had been deleted (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> was
        readily visualized in cultures <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> post transfection
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Δpre-M</ENAMEX>/E-GFP, as seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        Encouraged by the success with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, we next looked at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Δpre-M</ENAMEX>/E replicons with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> env material cloned into the
        position of the deleted pre-M and E genes. We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120 and Δpre-M/E-gp160</ENAMEX>, expressing HIV-1
        gp120 and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp160</NUMEX> respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Expression of
        genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">replicon</ENAMEX> was reproducibly
        visualized at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48-50 hours</TIMEX> post transfection (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>&
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), at a level of approximatley <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the cells, but in
        many experiments, the corresponding cultures transfected
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp160</NUMEX> replicon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp160</ENAMEX>, either no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> could be visualized (not shown), or only
        fluorescent cells with a bizarre morphology (characterized
        by debris and/or degenerative appearance) could be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). However, when we harvested cultures
        earlier, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> post transfection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp160</ENAMEX>,
        intact, fluorescing cells were readily found, though the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> still appeared atypical compared to either that
        of cultures transfected with wild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type dengue</ENAMEX> virus and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">replicon</ENAMEX> (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        To serve as effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, it is preferable, if not
        necessary, that expression systems be capable of expressing
        immunogens for longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX>. Although we
        knew from previous experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> replicons
        could survive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 7 days</TIMEX> in culture, the limited
        durability of cells transfected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp160</NUMEX>-expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicons</ENAMEX> raised the question of whether or not cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transfected with Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">replicons</ENAMEX> could survive for
        similarly long times in culture. When cultures transfected
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> were trypsinized and replated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        post transfection and then analyzed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 9</TIMEX> post
        transfection, fluorescent cells were readily visualized
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In comparison to cultures that were not
        trypsinized on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> post transfection however, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> had fewer intact fluorescent cells and more debris
        (not shown). Although this suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> expression
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicon</ENAMEX> stresses cells, we did find fields
        with adjacent, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp120</NUMEX> positive cells, suggesting that at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cell division between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7 and day 9</TIMEX> had
        occurred in a cell successfully transfected with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 days</TIMEX> of culture
        post transfection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 0.1%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> or less were positive (not shown), which
        represents a considerable decrease from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 hours</TIMEX> post
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX>.
        In the experiments described above and in Figures
        3through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> replicons with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterologous</ENAMEX> material from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> was followed either using
        anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> sera or anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue sera</ENAMEX>, depending on the
        experiment. To demonstrate that the same cells were
        expressing both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we used a
        double label technique, with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FITC detecting HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rhodamine detecting dengue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Figure
        8demonstrates the concordance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
        gp120 expression in cultures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> post transfection with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX>, (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). The more extensive background
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX> encountered when visualizing the
        rhodamine fluorescence makes low levels of specific
        rhodamine fluorescence more difficult to discern, but
        clearly all intact cells positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> are also positive
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The rhodamine-positive spot in the
        lower left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> is cellular debris and is also
        positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> fluorescence was
        not well reproduced by digital photography, though it still
        may be visualized on certain monitor/computer combinations.
        Similar results were obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> post transfection
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Our finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue virus replicons</ENAMEX> can express
        heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> envelop, for prolonged
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of time in cell culture without selection
        represents a significant step in developing a new vector
        system potentially capable of delivering immunogens to any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> in whose cells the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX> can replicate.
        Flavivirus replicons have previously been demonstrated to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 41 days</TIMEX> in tissue
        culture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunjin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . However, these experiments were
        done in the presence of selection for the heterologous
        genes cloned into the replicons. We have demonstrated
        heterologous gene expression in the absence of selection
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to at least 9 days</TIMEX> post transfection with chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX>. Although we have formally demonstrated
        expression, not replication, our previous demonstration of
        the replication [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX> lacking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterologous</ENAMEX> material suggests that the replicons described
        here, which contain heterologous material, are indeed
        replicating. Evidence that cells continue to replicate and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> replicon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells after
        transfection with these chimeric replicons further supports
        the implication of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chimeric replicon replication</ENAMEX>. Ideally,
        to serve as dual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> as well as against
        other pathogens, the replicons should express the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        NS1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . So far, attempts to visualize
        NS1 production by Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> have failed, presumably
        because of the low transfection efficiencies. However, we
        have previously argued that the replication of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicons</ENAMEX> could not take place in the absence of the
        essential non-structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS1</TIMEX>, which implies that NS1
        is being made. The frequencies and fluorescence intensities
        of replicon positive cells seen in the experiments reported
        here are comparable to those seen for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> replicons
        lacking heterologous material [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that
        replication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Δpre-M</ENAMEX>/E replicons containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterologous</ENAMEX> material is occurring as well. The finding of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> closely apposed pair of cells expressing high
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicon proteins</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 9</TIMEX> post transfection, two
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after trypsinization and replating (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, right
        panel), not only implies replicon replication, but also
        implies the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NS-1 protein</ENAMEX> as well. The
        definitive demonstration of effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NS-1</ENAMEX> production will
        have to await studies of the immune response in animals
        immunized with these replicons.
        Choice of immunogen remains problematic for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. Clearly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 gp160</ENAMEX> is too toxic for prolonged
        expression. Even the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp120</NUMEX>-expressing replicon seems mildly
        toxic in that the frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp120</NUMEX> positive cells
        declines with time in culture post transfection with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> (not shown). However, as noted above, we
        have seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> instance of putative cellular
        division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 7 days</TIMEX> after being successfully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transfected by Δpre-M/E-gp120</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
        Experiments are now in progress to determine the
        feasibility of long term expression of other HIV-1
        immunogens, including gag and tat.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Demonstration of long term protein expression by a
        gp120-expressing replicon alone, of course, does not
        demonstrate that the chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue replicons</ENAMEX> constitute
        an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. However, at the very least they add
        to the potential armamentarium available to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccinologist</ENAMEX>. It is highly likely that a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        vaccination protocol will involve multiple immunogens and
        delivery protocols. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attenuated Friend leukemia</ENAMEX> virus (FLV) develop an immune
        response whose efficacy is dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
        effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> separable spleen cell populations
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . By analogy, it may be necessary to devise multiple
        strategies to obtain a similarly complex and effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>, different immunogens and modes of immunization can
        induce different modes of protection with varying degrees
        of effectiveness [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] Harnessing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple immune</ENAMEX> responses may be the answer to designing an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">effective HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and the availability of
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> may facilitate the harnessing of multiple
        responses.
        Much work obviously remains to be done to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        replicons as effective vectors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV immunogens</ENAMEX>. More
        work needs to be done on determining the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicons</ENAMEX> to express other potential immunogens, including
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gag</ENAMEX>, tat (reviewed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>) and env genes with deleted
        hypervariable regions [see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ]. Animal studies in our
        lab are currently being initiated to determine the nature
        of the immune response such vectors can induce in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        these studies will presumably need to be extended to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX>. Finally, effective delivery systems will need to
        be devised. Although our successful development of a
        plasmid which can express a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> replicon from
        transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> facilitates delivery by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccination</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] , the development of packaging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines which can
        package these replicons into virions would be a major step
        forward towards a vaccine which could be conveniently
        administered in typical clinical situations. Experiments
        are currently underway in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to develop such
        packaging cell lines.
