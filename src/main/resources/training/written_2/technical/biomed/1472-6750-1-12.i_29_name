        The analysis of gene function during mammalian embryonic
        development relies heavily on the use of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        However, expression of alleles that result in embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lethality</ENAMEX> cannot be studied using regular transgenic
        procedures because lines of founder <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> cannot be
        established. Analysis of such alleles in mammals has
        historically relied upon transient transgenic procedures [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . In this approach, fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are injected with a
        transgene construct and allowed to develop to a
        pre-determined embryonic stage 
        in utero before being collected for
        phenotypic analysis. Using this method a variable number of
        transgenes integrate into random genomic loci.
        Unfortunately, the local chromosomal environment can affect
        expression of the integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and this can result
        in unpredictable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression. Moreover, because no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder line</ENAMEX> is established it is not possible to repeat an
        analysis with a specific transgenic mouse embryo.
        The problem of random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> integration can be
        overcome by targeting transgenes to a specific genomic
        locus by homologous recombination in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . A
        method that allows the introduction of single copy
        transgenes into the X-linked 
        hprt locus has been described
        previously by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronson</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In this approach
        single-copy transgenes are introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' of the 
        hprt locus by homologous
        recombination in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. This is an extremely efficient
        procedure because targeted clones have reconstituted the 
        hprt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and are selected on the
        basis of growth in HAT medium. Following this method,
        upward of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of HAT resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones contain
        correctly targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The 
        hprt locus is a particularly suitable
        site for the integration of transgenes because it exists as
        an X-linked gene present as a single copy in male <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells.
        Moreover, the 
        hprt gene is ubiquitously expressed
        and so provides a favorable chromatin environment for
        transgene expression. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that
        the level of expression of transgenes inserted into the 
        hprt locus is directed solely by
        exogenous transcriptional regulatory elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> derived from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells clones
        containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expressed from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> all
        exhibit comparable levels of expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Although the targeting of constructs to the 
        hprt locus facilitates consistent
        expression of transgenes it does not overcome the need to
        generate founder lines of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. However,
        pioneering work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagy</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> has shown that embryos and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        can be derived directly from R1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by aggregating
        them with tetraploid embryos [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . This suggests that
        controlled expression of transgenes encoding possible
        gain-of-function and developmental-lethal alleles could be
        achieved by generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        containing transgenes inserted into the 
        hprt locus. Unfortunately, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and embryos by tetraploid aggregation
        from available Hprt negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines has proven to be
        inefficient and unreliable (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">S.A.D.</ENAMEX> unpublished). In this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, we describe the generation of a new Hprt negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell line that is compatible with the tetraploid
        aggregation procedure. Moreover, we demonstrate that it
        facilitates efficient targeting of transgenes to the 
        hprt locus as well as the subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of clonal transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX> that express
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> in a promoter-dependent manner.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Nagy</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> demonstrated that embryos and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could be derived solely from R1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by
        aggregating them with tetraploid embryos [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Although
        we were able to repeat these data using R1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells we were
        unable to generate midgestation embryos from
        E14TG2a-derived strains of 
        hprt negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines using the
        same approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . We believed it was unlikely
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hprt</ENAMEX> itself was required to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hprt knockout mice</ENAMEX> are viable and
        fertile [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . E14TG2a-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines contain a
        large spontaneous deletion encompassing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> kb of the 
        hprt locus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, it
        seemed possible that sequences within this region were
        necessary to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell pluripotency</ENAMEX>. However, we
        believed a more likely scenario was that the available
        lines contained unrelated genetic or epigenetic alterations
        that were incompatible with the aggregation procedure.
        Consistent with this interpretation, Eggan 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> have recently shown that viable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> are more efficiently produced through
        tetraploid-mediated cloning from outbred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell line
        compared to inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . We, therefore,
        believed it likely that aggregation-compatible 
        hprt negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could be
        generated by targeted mutation of the 
        hprt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in R1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. To test
        this we generated a targeting vector to replace exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of
        the mouse 
        hprt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> with a 
        neomycin phosphotransferase
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">neo</NUMEX>) gene that conferred resistance to te
        pharmacological inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">G418</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1a</ENAMEX>).
        Following transfection of this plasmid into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">R1</NUMEX> cells 192
        clones that were resistant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G418</NUMEX> were collected and grown
        in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-thioguanine to select for loss of Hprt
        activity. Of the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX> G418-resistant clones that
        were harvested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>, named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F3</TIMEX>, was also resistant to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-thioguanine and sensitive to growth in HAT medium (fig
        3b). The integrity of the targeting event was next
        confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F3 genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. As
        shown in fig 1athe correct integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> at the 
        hprt locus was predicted to delete a
        BamH1 restriction endonuclease cut-site from intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
        replace it with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">BamH1</NUMEX> site that is unique to the mutant 
        hprt allele. This restriction
        fragment polymorphism could be detected using an 
        hprt-specific probe (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1a</ENAMEX>). The
        wild type BamH1 fragment was predicted to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> kb based
        on sequence analysis while the mutant fragment should be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX> kb. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1cshows</ENAMEX> that digestion of wild-type R1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BamH1</ENAMEX> did indeed generate a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> kb fragment that
        could be detected with intron <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. In contrast, F3
        cells were shown to have replaced this fragment with an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BamH1</ENAMEX> fragment thereby confirming the integrity of the
        targeting event.
        For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells to be a suitable vehicle for the generation
        of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> they should be competent to generate
        chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that can transmit alleles through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germline</ENAMEX>. To test the "germline potential" of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells we
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generated chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by aggregating F3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        with CD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> morulae and allowing them to develop to term 
        in utero. The resulting chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were bred with CD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and the genotype of
        offspring determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from mouse tails. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1cshows</ENAMEX> that agouti <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1</NUMEX> female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contained both the mutant (paternal) and wild type
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maternal</NUMEX>) 
        hprt alleles. In contrast, the agouti
        F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">male mice</ENAMEX> contained only a wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hprt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> inherited from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maternal X-chromosome</ENAMEX> as expected. From this we were able
        to conclude that F3 
        hprt null <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are indeed
        competent to transmit alleles through the germline and that
        the resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> were fertile and viable as reported
        previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        We next addressed whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> could be generated
        solely from F3 Hprt negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by aggregating these
        cells with tetraploid CD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> embryos and allowing them to
        develop 
        in utero until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of gestation
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El 3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX>,b,cshow that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F3 cells</ENAMEX> could indeed give
        rise to normal embryos (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). All embryos exhibited
        characteristic features of midgestation stages of
        development including normal rostral-caudal patterning,
        beating hearts, normal limb formation including the
        formation of fingers. F3 cells derive from the agouti
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pigmented</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV129/J</ENAMEX> strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In contrast, albino
        CD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> donated the tetraploid morulae used in the
        aggregation procedure. The finding, shown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs 2a</TIMEX>,b,c,
        that all the resulting embryos displayed clear retinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigmentation</ENAMEX> strongly implied that the embryos were F3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
        cell-derived. We confirmed this by determining the genotype
        of the embryos by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2dshows</ENAMEX> that all embryos contained a restriction
        fragment polymorphism that was indicative of deletion of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hprt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon1</ENAMEX>. No wild type 
        hprt allele was detected confirming
        that the embryos were generated entirely from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells.
        These data demonstrate that the 
        hprt gene is not essential for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of embryos from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by tetraploid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells should could provide a
        suitable vehicle for the direct generation of transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX>.
        Previously it has been shown that a targeting vector,
        pMP8, can correct the loss of Hprt activity in E14TG2a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
        cells that lack exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> of the 
        hprt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 15</ENAMEX> ] . The design of
        this vector implied that it should also be capable of
        correcting the 
        hprt exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> deficiency in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells
        and could, therefore, be used to introduce transgenes into
        the 
        hprt locus by homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>. To test this we generated a modified vector
        based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMP8</TIMEX>. The practical features of this modification
        are that it removes the lacZ sequences in the vector
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backbone</ENAMEX> and reduces the overall size of the vector, both
        of which improve subsequent cloning steps. This vector,
        pMP8NEBÎ”LacZ, contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of homology consisting of
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.4 kb</NUMEX> of mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' 
        hprt genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> flanking a unique
        Not1 restriction endonuclease cut site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homology</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.8 kb</NUMEX> of the human 
        hprt gene that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>
        kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse genomic sequence</ENAMEX> that includes exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 3a</ENAMEX>)
        as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Homologous recombination
        at the modified 
        hprt locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells should
        substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> containing 
        hprt exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> for 
        neo thereby reconstituting a gene
        encoding active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hprt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 3a</ENAMEX>). Moreover, only cells having
        undergone a successful homologous recombination event
        should become HAT resistant and carry the targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. To assess the efficiency of this approach we
        attempted to target a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">LacZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter transgene</ENAMEX> whose
        expression is controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> from the alpha
        myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (Î±MHC) gene to the modified 
        hprt locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells. We chose the
        Î±MHC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> because others have demonstrated, using
        traditional transgenic procedures, that it directs high
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene expression specifically in cardiac
        tissue of early mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Cells were
        selected for resistance to HAT following electroporation of
        the Î± 
        MHC-LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>. 16 HAT resistant cells lines were collected and
        their genotype determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig</ENAMEX>
        3cshows that, in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> that
        specifically recognizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> identified a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kb EcoRV</ENAMEX> fragment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HAT</ENAMEX>-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAT</ENAMEX>-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> retrieved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig 3bshows</ENAMEX> that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> had become G418
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-thioguanine sensitive confirming that the 
        neo gene had indeed been replaced
        with 
        hprt -coding sequences in the F3
        cells. These data confirm that this selection strategy is
        extremely efficient in identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones
        containing correctly targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The ultimate use of this procedure is to generate clonal
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> embryos directly from the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
        cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> in this would provide a system in which to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> alleles with potentially lethal phenotypes in the
        developing embryo. We, therefore, determined whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> could be generated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F3</TIMEX> cells that contained
        an Î±MHC-LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and whether these embryos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriately</ENAMEX> expressed Î²-galactosidase. E8<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> embryos were
        generated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent Î±MHC-LacZ cell lines and
        stained for expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase</NUMEX>. Representative
        embryos, shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig 3dall</ENAMEX> developed normally and
        expressed high levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase</NUMEX> in the developing
        heart, mimicking the expression of endogenous Î±MHC [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, none of the embryos exhibited ectopic patterns
        of expression lending further support to the proposal that
        expression of transgenes introduced to the 
        hprt locus is primarily dependent on
        the accompanying transcriptional regulatory elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        .
      
      
        Discussion and conclusions
        Here we have described the generation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell line
        and a procedure that will allow the phenotypic analyses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> embryos expressing lethal alleles. This
        procedure is an important addition to the available
        repertoire of molecular genetic techniques available to
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> because it overcomes several
        deficiencies associated with alternative transient
        transgenic approaches normally used to study
        gain-of-function and dominant-negative alleles. Traditional
        procedures rely on the generation of transgenic embryos
        through micro injection of fertilized mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. Using
        this approach an unpredictable number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-copies
        are incorporated at a random location in the recipient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. This can result in ectopic expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> because both copy number and the site integration
        can influence transgene expression.
        In the approach described here, a targeting vector that
        contains exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the 
        hprt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> along with a specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> is used to reconstitute Hprt activity in Hprt
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. Successful targeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> to
        the 
        hprt locus in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hprt</ENAMEX> negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        can be selected by growing transfected cells in HAT medium.
        The efficiency of this selection procedure is such that
        close to all HAT resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> contain a correctly
        targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. Moreover, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is
        introduced into the 
        hprt locus its expression is
        dependent upon the inclusion of specific transcriptional
        regulatory elements and remains relatively unaffected by
        the local chromatin environment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . A major advantage
        of this targeted transgenic approach compared to
        traditional transgenics is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene expression</ENAMEX> is
        predictable so expression at ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is largely
        avoided. The availability of F3 Hprt negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        allows transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">embryos</ENAMEX> to be derived directly from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">transgenic ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by aggregating the cells with
        tetraploid embryos and allowing them to develop 
        in utero. Each embryo is, in effect,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clonal</ENAMEX> because it is generated from a single clonal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell
        line. This allows reproducible comparison of the phenotype
        generated by a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> at different developmental
        stages. Moreover, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is present as a
        single copy at a known site of integration it circumvents
        the need to generate many different transgenic lines from a
        given construct as is the case when using a transient
        transgenic procedure.
        There are many potential uses for this method of
        generating transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX>. The most obvious is
        that it provides a mechanism for generating embryos that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> alleles that are predicted, or known, to be
        detrimental to normal embryonic development, for example
        dominant-negative or gain-of-function alleles. Indeed, the
        expression of dominant negative alleles that can
        potentially disrupt multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has
        been used extensively in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> laevis and has, for
        example, helped elucidate the action of fibroblast growth
        factors during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesoderm</ENAMEX> formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Such alleles are
        particularly useful when a null allele in the same gene
        causes a disruptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> prior to the stage of
        development of interest. Choosing a promoter that expresses
        the dominant negative allele later in development or in a
        specific cell type could potentially circumvent any early
        phenotype associated with a null allele.
        Another important use of this procedure could be to
        identify transcriptional regulatory regions that control
        expression of specific genes during development. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transgenic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been extensively used to identify regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that control gene expression 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . This has, in turn
        allowed the elucidation of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that control
        cell differentiation during development. In this regard,
        the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells coupled with targeting transgenes to
        the 
        hprt locus offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        advantages over traditional transgenic approaches. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that it is extremely rapid. Once the targeting
        construct is in hand it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately four to five</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> to generate transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
        advantage is due to the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> at a
        known and constant integration site. This potentially
        allows the comparison of levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene expression
        driven by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> thereby offering a
        quantitative 
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">vivo</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">assay</ENAMEX>.
        In sum, the availability of tetraploid
        aggregation-competent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells that support targeting of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes</ENAMEX> to the 
        hprt locus should facilitate the
        rapid analysis of transcriptional regulatory elements 
        in vivo as well as the phenotypic
        characterization of alleles that are incompatible with
        normal development. We, therefore, believe that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F3</NUMEX> cells
        provide a powerful new tool for molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticists</ENAMEX>.

            pÎ”Hprt
            The targeting plasmid used to delete 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hprt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon1</ENAMEX> was called pÎ”Hprt to
            indicate this deletion. It was derived from the plasmid
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pOS</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DUP/DEL</ENAMEX> that contained the 
            neomycin phosphotransferase
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">neo</NUMEX>) gene that confers resistance to the
            pharmacological inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G418</ENAMEX> and also contains the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herpes Simplex Virus</ENAMEX> 
            thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) that
            confers sensitivity to gancyclovir. Importantly the 
            neo gene is flanked by 
            loxP sequences permitting loss of
            G418 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> where useful. pÎ”Hprt was constructed by
            introducing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb BamHI/HindIII</ENAMEX> fragment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' 
            hprt genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E14TG2a origin</ENAMEX>)

            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The ends of the fragments were made blunt
            using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of homology was introduced
            into the unique <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Bcl1</NUMEX> site of the previous plasmid as a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7 Kb BamHI</ENAMEX> fragment from pMP1(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SV129 origin</ENAMEX>) that
            contained murine

            pMP8NEBÎ”LacZ
            The plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pMP8NEBÎ”LacZ</ENAMEX> was generated by ligating
            an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 kb</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xba1</ENAMEX> fragment from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pMP8</NUMEX> into the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Xba1</NUMEX> site of
            pNEB193 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>) from which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> sequences
            had been removed as a NarI/EcoRI fragment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . This
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hprt</ENAMEX> replacement vector contains
            a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of 
            hprt homology consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>
            kb of mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' 
            hprt genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> flanking a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unique Not1</ENAMEX> cloning site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of homology
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.8 kb</NUMEX> of the human 
            hprt gene that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon1</ENAMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.9 kb</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse genomic sequence</ENAMEX> that includes exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
            A detailed description of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pMP8</NUMEX> targeting vector,
            from which these sequences were derived, has been
            described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . A partial nucleotide
            sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pMP8NEBÎ”LacZ</ENAMEX> is available from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.A.D.</ENAMEX> upon
            request.
          
          
            pÎ±MHC-LacZ-Hprt
            This targeting vector was constructed by inserting a

          by including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼M gancyclovir (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>). To identify cells
          that had lost HPRT activity G418/gancyclovir-resistant

          using the following procedure. F3 cells were grown for
