        Among the many approaches to identifying functional
        relationships among genes, the use of bibliographic data to
        group genes that are functionally related has recently
        attracted great attention. The huge repository of
        biological literature, which is still growing at a rapid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>, makes it increasingly difficult for any individual to
        monitor exhaustively the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> items related to a
        specific biological process. Therefore, automated data
        mining systems for biological literature are becoming a
        necessity.
        The availability of biomedical literature in electronic
        format has made it possible to implement automatic text
        processing methods to expose implicit relationships among
        different documents, and more importantly, the functional
        relationships among the molecules and processes that these
        documents describe.
        Shatkay 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] proposed a method, which
        we denote as the "kernel document method", and applied it
        to the identification of functional relationships among
        yeast genes. Briefly, for each gene, a kernel document is
        carefully selected to establish a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> correspondence
        between a gene and a kernel document. A set of "related
        documents" associated with each kernel document is
        identified using statistical information retrieval methods.
        The extent to which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of related documents
        corresponding to each of a pair of kernel documents overlap
        reflects the relevance of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents, and
        hence the possible functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatedness</ENAMEX> of the
        corresponding genes.
        The utility of this method relies heavily on the quality
        of the kernel documents. In this context, a good kernel
        document should focus on the functions of a gene, instead
        of on other topics such as the methods or techniques used
        to identify or study the gene. With carefully selected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents, the relatedness of this gene to others
        can be made reliant on functional rather than, e.g.,
        structural characteristics. For example, if the topic of
        one kernel document is "studying gene A by method <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>", and
        the topic of the other kernel document is "studying gene B
        by method <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>", <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functionally unrelated genes A and B
        could be related to one another simply because they have
        both been studied by method <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. Avoiding</ENAMEX> such "false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>" is a challenge in applying this method. The
        selection of functionally-descriptive kernel documents is,
        therefore, a key to the success of this algorithm.
        In the original kernel document method, all documents
        that are related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents are weighted
        equally in establishing the qualitative and quantative
        aspects of relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents.
        A better practice is to give each document a weight
        reflecting the relative uniqueness of this document's
        relationship to the kernel documents. A document that is
        related to only a few kernel documents is given a greater
        weight than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that is related to many kernel documents.
        This argument can be illustrated with an intuitive example:
        if you are asked to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, it is
        not very helpful if the only information you are given is
        that each of the two has a nose. However, if you are told
        that each of the two has a mole on the forehead, it will
        not be too difficult to single them out. This is because
        "having a nose" is a feature common to almost everybody.
        But the description that each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> has a mole on
        the forehead, an uncommon feature, is an important piece of
        information that can be used to establish a link between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        The kernel document method was initially applied to
        yeast genes. Intense, relatively long-standing analysis of
        yeast genetics has resulted in a large number of PubMed
        entries on these genes. Whether the kernel document method
        could be applied to other less abundantly represented
        genes, such as human genes, was not known. Here we will
        apply this method to human genes, and show that this method
        can indeed produce meaningful results when applied to human
        genes.
        A potential limitation of the original kernel document
        method is that only one kernel document is chosen for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. Many genes encode multi-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> document might relate only to a certain aspect of
        the gene's many functions. We addressed this problem by
        selecting multiple kernel documents for a gene, so that any
        known function of the gene would be discussed in at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these kernel documents.
        Jenssen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] took a different
        approach. They analyzed the titles and abstracts of MEDLINE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> to look for co-occurrence of gene symbols. The
        results are available at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PubGene http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pubgene</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
        This approach is based on the assumption that if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene
        symbols appear in the same MEDLINE record, the genes are
        likely to be related. Furthermore, the number of papers in
        which the pair of genes both appear is used to assess the
        strength of relationships between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Jenssen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> manually examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>
        randomly selected pairs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of genes that had
        been created using this method: the proportion of incorrect
        (biologically meaningless) pairs were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> for the
        low-weight category and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> for the high-weight category.
        The main advantage of this method in comparison with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> document method is that it avoids the difficulty of
        selecting an appropriate kernel document. However, this
        method cannot identify genes that are functionally related,
        but are not mentioned together in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> abstract.
        Such implicit relationships between genes are inherently
        more interesting in the context of mechanism/pathway
        discovery by computation.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we employ a method that is based upon the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> document concept, with several enhancements. First,
        instead of choosing one kernel document for each gene, we
        employ all of the reference articles cited for each gene
        symbol in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX>. Admittedly, not all of these articles are
        good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for kernel documents. However, the
        reference articles cited under each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> entry are a set of
        documents selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> familiar with the gene
        and are, therefore, related to the gene in some way.
        Furthermore, by a simple examination of the titles of the
        articles for keywords alluding to methods or techniques,
        many articles that would be likely to constitute false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> in this context are excluded. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, instead of
        weighing each related article equally, a weight is
        calculated for each article that is related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents. We call these articles "base vector
        documents", because eventually a kernel document will be
        represented by a vector whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are determined by
        whether it is related to a base vector document. The more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents a base vector document is related to, the
        less its weight.

            The related documents (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>) of a particular
            paper are listed according to their relevance to the
            paper. Documents that appear on the top of the list are
            more similar to the query than those appear near the
            bottom of the list. We keep only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX> of the first
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> related documents in the list and the data are
            stored in another table, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fields,

          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Vectors Documents</ENAMEX>
          Using the data obtained in the previous section, the
          base vector documents are defined. These are the
          documents that are related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> other
          documents and are among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> top-ranking related
          documents of any document. The result is inserted into
          another database table that consists of three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMID</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> identifier of the base vector document;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. LINKED2, the number of kernel documents of which the
          specified document is a neighbor; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WEIGHT</ENAMEX>, which is
          an indication of the importance of a base vector document
          in revealing the relevance between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents.
          The weight 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           for a base vector document 
          b 
          
            i 
           is calculated using the following equation:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           is the number of related documents for 
          b 
          
            i 
           and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the total number of kernel
          documents. This weight measurement method is based upon
          information theory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and is similar to the weight
          measure employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] to evaluate the
          significance of a specific keyword in determining the
          relatedness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>.

          calculated, the scores are stored in a relational

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

           does not directly reflect the relevance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          genes. To assess the functional relationship between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          genes, gene symbols must be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX>.
          In order to identify the set of genes that are
          relevant to a query gene 
          G, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX> of all reference
          papers listed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMID</ENAMEX> for the query gene are
          obtained. Each of these reference papers, except any
          paper whose KEEP flag is turned off, is treated as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> document.
          There are several considerations that support this
          approach to selection of kernel documents:
          • The reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> listed under each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMID</ENAMEX> were
          selected specifically because of their relevance to the
          corresponding gene;
          • The titles of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> were screened to exclude
          those that describe commonly used methods or techniques
          in order to reduce the number of "false positives";
          • The process can be fully automated to avoid manually
          selecting kernel documents.
          An interface is provided to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to
          "fine-tune" the query by manually selecting only some of
          the reference papers as kernel documents.
          Next, all documents (represented by their PMIDs) that
          are related to each kernel document with a score higher
          than a specified threshold are identified. The OMIMIDs
          that have cited papers with any of these PMIDs are
          collected. Finally, these OMIMIDs are connected to their
          respective gene symbols. The entire process is shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">User Interface</ENAMEX>
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> is available at

          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> and a cutoff score (i.e., the cosine
          similarity score between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents that
          correspond to respective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) are entered, a list of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> for the gene is displayed.
          Only those papers whose KEEP flag is turned on are shown.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> may select specific paper(s) from the list as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents, or simply check the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Check All</ENAMEX>" box to
          use all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> as kernel documents.
          Once the submit button is clicked, the genes with
          scores higher than the cutoff score are displayed.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Summary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raw Data</ENAMEX>
          At the time when the raw data were downloaded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11251</NUMEX> gene symbols in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> gene
          list, corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7192</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMIDs</ENAMEX>. Multiple
          gene symbols may have the same OMIMID because many genes
          have aliases, resulting in several symbols referring to
          the same gene.
          Among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7192</TIMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMIDs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7085</TIMEX> cite reference
          paper with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.5%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMIDs</ENAMEX> do not
          cite any reference paper, or only cite reference papers
          whose PMIDs are not specified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54024</NUMEX> reference
          papers are listed under the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7085</TIMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMIDs</ENAMEX>. Some
          papers are referenced under several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMIDs</ENAMEX>, therefore,
          the actual number of distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47428</NUMEX>.
          The title of the corresponding document for each of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47428</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX> is also obtained. After screening the
          titles using the method described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the KEEP flags
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3680</TIMEX> documents (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.8%</NUMEX>) were turned off.
          Ultimately, only those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43748</NUMEX> documents whose KEEP flags
          are turned on will be used as kernel documents. However,
          we initially treat all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47428</NUMEX> documents as kernel
          documents, allowing us to estimate the extent to which
          these documents whose KEEP flags are turned off
          contribute to false positives.
          For each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47428</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMIDs</ENAMEX>, the related
          documents ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>") are obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>. As
          indicated earlier, only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 PMIDs</NUMEX> of the list
          of related documents are stored, because they are the
          ones most related to the kernel document. The highest
          ranking neighbor of any document is, of course, itself.
          This search resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4629037</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, a
          number that would be much larger if all, instead of only
          the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of a document are kept.
        
        
          Summary of Results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calculation</ENAMEX>
          The preliminary search identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">437382</NUMEX> base vector
          documents. Any of these documents is a neighbor of at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents. On average, a base vector
          document is related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> kernel documents. The average
          weight of the base vector documents is of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.13</NUMEX>, the
          maximum weight is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.53</NUMEX>, which corresponds to those base
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> documents that are only related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel
          documents; the minimum weight is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.66</NUMEX>, which corresponds
          to a base vector document with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. As
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section, the weight of a base
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> document indicates how much information is
          conveyed about the relevance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents by
          knowing that both of them are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of this
          particular base vector document. The more kernel
          documents a base vector document is related to, the less
          its weight. Figure 2shows this relationship. For example,
          a base vector document that is related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">740</NUMEX> kernel
          documents has a weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> of the weight of a
          document that is related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> kernel documents.
          Next, the norm of each kernel document is calculated.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> kernel documents with a norm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. These
          documents do not have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> that is one of the
          base vector documents. As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 47333</NUMEX> kernel
          documents are left.
          Finally, the cosine similarity score of each pair of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents is calculated. A document is treated as
          a kernel document if its KEEP flag is on and its norm is
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43658</NUMEX> such documents. Out of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43658</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">43658-1</ENAMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">952988653</NUMEX> possible pairs, only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6596918</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.7%</NUMEX>) have a similarity score that is
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, indicating some relationship between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. The average score
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>. However, if both documents of a pair are listed
          as references under the same OMIMID, the average score is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>, which is much higher than the overall average
          score. This difference is expected because the documents
          listed under the same OMIMID have been selected because
          they all have some relationship to the gene that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMID</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, this average
          score also provides an indication of the approximate
          value of the threshold score that should be used to
          decide whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kernel documents are closely
          related.
          Documents that discuss methods or techniques are not
          included when the similarity scores are calculated,
          because these documents can lead to false positives - a
          pair of genes with a high score that are functionally
          unrelated. To investigate the impact of such documents,
          we intentionally included them in the calculation of the
          scores. Excluding these documents when responding to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> is straightfoward, one needs only to check the KEEP
          flag of a document. The average similarity score of any
          pair in which both documents have a turned-off KEEP flag
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>, much higher than the overall average score <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>
          and close to the average score among a pair of documents
          referenced by the same OMIMID, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>. This result
          indicates that these documents should be excluded from
          calculations designed to find functional
          relationships.
          Although documents that are likely to cause false
          positive have been excluded by the automated screening
          process described above, the screened set of documents
          may still include many that are not optimal kernel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">document</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. A solution to this is to actually
          let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> select specific kernel documents from a
          list of documents.
        
        
          An Example
          As an illustration, we use this computational strategy
          to identify genes related to the apoptosis (programmed
          cell death) pathway in human. A brief recent review of
          this pathway has been given by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeFrancesco</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          To use this strategy, it is necessary to have a gene
          to start with. This is usually a gene that is known to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the pathway or function of interest.
          Usually, such a gene is known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> who submits the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX>. If necessary, one can also perform a preliminary
          search of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> for the functions or processes of
          interest in order to obtain the name of a gene to start
          with.
          We start with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APAF1</TIMEX>, a gene known to be involved in
          the apoptosis pathway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . A cutoff score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> is
          employed, and all reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> for this
          gene are used as kernel documents. The analysis
          identified the list of related genes displayed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          CASP1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAPS2 and CASP3</TIMEX> all belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          apoptosis-related cysteine proteases. Caspase activation
          is a key regulatory step for apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIABLO</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAC</ENAMEX> (second
          mitochondria-derived activator of caspase), promotes
          caspase activation in a cytochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-APAF1-CASP9</ENAMEX> pathway
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          The identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ABC3</ENAMEX> is more interesting,
          because they are not well recognized as components of the
          apoptosis pathway. In order to identify the process by
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX> was included, we retrace the search path to find
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> original kernel documents that related APAF1 to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>. They are: "Apaf-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elegans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CED-4</ENAMEX>, participates in cytochrome c-dependent
          activation of caspase-3" (PMID: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9267021</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> linked
          to APAF1; and "The ced-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> gene controls the timing of
          programmed cell death in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans" (PMID: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10882128</ENAMEX>), a
          paper linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kell</ENAMEX> blood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> precursor.
          Stanfield 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] noted that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">458</NUMEX>-amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid CED8 transmembrane protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is weakly
          similar to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">XK protein</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CED8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX> proteins
          share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity, have similar hydropathy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plots</ENAMEX>, and both contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> predicted
          membrane-spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. CED8 functions downstream of,
          or in parallel to, the regulatory cell death gene CED9,
          and may function as a cell death effector downstream of
          the caspase encoded by programmed cell death gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CED3</TIMEX>.
          APAF1 is known to share amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> similarity with CED3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CED4</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is believed to initiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans.
          The gene ABC3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC Transporter 3</ENAMEX>) is linked to APAF1
          in a manner similar to that which connects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APAF1</TIMEX>.
          It is reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CED7 protein</ENAMEX> has sequence similarity
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> transporters. CED7 functions in the engulfment of
          cell remnants during programmed cell death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          There was evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BCL2</ENAMEX> is a homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CED9</ENAMEX>:
          CED9 encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> showing sequence
          and structural similarity to BCL2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . BCL2 is
          involved in programmed cell death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          A secondary search can be performed with each of the
          genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Usually, more stringent criteria is
          required for secondary searches because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> used
          for secondary queries often have other functions not
          related to the one of interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kernel</ENAMEX> documents need to
          be selected more carefully, and a higher cut-off score
          might be used.
          For example, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>, if all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> for
          the particular gene are used as kernel documents, there
          are many high-score hits that do not seem to be directly
          linked to apoptosis. Among the kernel document candidates
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>, the title of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the papers mentions
          programmed cell death. The majority of papers discusses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">McLeod syndrome</ENAMEX>, which is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>, but has no
          recognized relationship with apoptosis.
          Therefore, further inspection is necessary to
          determine whether these hits are really linked to the
          apoptosis pathway. To simplify the process and obtain
          better results, instead using all reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> cited
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> for each of these genes, we manually select
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kernel</ENAMEX> documents from the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> reference papers
          for these secondary searches, using the interface
          described before. For example, in a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX>
          papers cited for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XK</ENAMEX>, we choose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> paper, titled
          "The ced-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> gene controls the timing of programmed cell
          death in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans".
          With the results of the initial and secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">searches</ENAMEX>, a network of genes nominally associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> can be built. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          If necessary, further searches can be performed with
          the hits from a previous search, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> can
          be expanded to include more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The similarity score is the only criterion used to
        determine whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> documents are related. Any two
        documents with a similarity score above the cutoff score
        are considered to be related.
        Here we discuss how the cutoff score should be
        determined. To this end, it is necessary to investigate how
        the distribution of similarity scores differs between
        related and unrelated document pairs.
        To simplify the problem, we assume that any two
        documents that are listed as references under the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMID</ENAMEX> are related, and that the distribution between such
        documents approximates the distribution <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between two</NUMEX> related
        documents.
        For any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> documents that are not listed under the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIMID</ENAMEX>, it is reasonable to assume that they are unrelated,
        because the vast majority of such documents are, in fact,
        unrelated. Therefore, we assign the score distribution for
        unrelated documents to such pairs. It should be emphasized
        that this assumption is an approximation. Indeed, the most
        interesting documents are those documents that are not
        listed under the same OMIMID, but are found through
        analysis to be related. However, this assumption makes
        finding the distribution of similarity scores among
        unrelated documents much easier.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2is</ENAMEX> a summary of the score distributions of
        related and unrelated document pairs. Note that for
        unrelated documents, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the scores are less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03087</NUMEX>, while for related documents, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25%</NUMEX> of the
        scores are less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03027</NUMEX>.
        The probability 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
        S > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) of the score 
        S being greater than a cutoff score, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         , can be easily found:
        
        where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S ≤</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) is the number of document pairs whose similarity
        score is not greater than the cutoff score, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the total number of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
        S > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) was calculated separately for those pairs in which
        both documents were listed under the same OMIMID, i.e., the
        "related documents" according to the assumption above, and
        for those pairs in which the two documents were not listed
        under the same OMIMID, i.e., the "unrelated documents"
        corresponding to our definitions. The results are shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The solid curve is the probability 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
        S > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) for related document pairs (true positives), the
        dotted curve is the probability 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) for unrelated document pairs (false positives).
        Using a cutoff score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 61%</NUMEX> of the related
        documents will be accepted; these documents are true
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 39%</NUMEX> of the related documents will be
        rejected; these are the false negatives. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 14%</NUMEX> of the
        unrelated documents will be accepted; these are the false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>. And, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> of the unrelated documents will be
        rejected, these are the true negatives.
        Based on these results, the sensitivity and specificity
        of the search can be calculated. The sensitivity is the
        proportion of related document pairs that are about the
        cutoff score, and therefore are accepted. Therefore, the
        solid curve in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4is</NUMEX> also the sensitivity curve. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> is the proportion of unrelated documents that
        are below the cutoff score, and therefore are rejected.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specificity</ENAMEX> is equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
        S > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ), where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
        S > 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         ) is the proportion of unrelated document pairs that
        are above the cutoff score 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          cutoff 
         . In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the dashed curve is the specificity
        curve.
        Figure 4can be used to determine what cutoff score to
        use for any specific purpose. For example, using a high
        cutoff score such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>, the specificity will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.985</NUMEX>,
        corresponding to a false positive rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.5%</NUMEX>.
        However, the corresponding sensitivity is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.248</NUMEX>, so that
        above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> of the related documents will also be
        rejected. On the other hand, choosing a low cutoff score
        will result in many false positives, while ensuring that
        most related documents are accepted. Using a cutoff score
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.03</NUMEX>, both the sensitivity and specificity will be
        around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.75</NUMEX>. However, because there are often many more
        unrelated documents than related documents, the search
        result will still contain many false positives. By
        referring to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> can select a cutoff score that
        is best suited to their needs.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The key to the success of the kernel document method is
        the selection of the kernel documents. However, this is
        also the most difficult and tedious part of the
        implementation. An efficient way to select the kernel
        documents related to gene function is necessary for a
        large-scale literature mining effort using this method. We
        started with all of the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX>,
        and applied a filter to exclude those papers that are
        likely to focus primarily on methods and techniques. We can
        either treat the rest of papers as kernel documents, or
        allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to select kernel documents from this small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of papers (usually contain around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>).
        This process can be fully automated. Furthermore, since
        we are not limited to one kernel document per gene, a gene
        can correspond to multiple kernel documents that capture
        different aspects of its functions. This characteristic of
        the strategy makes it possible to identify genes that are
        related to the query gene through a variety of functional
        mechanisms.
        In distinction to the gene co-occurrence method used by
        Jenssen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX>, this approach does not require
        the symbols of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to appear in the title or abstract
        of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> in order to establish a relationship
        between them. As long as similar or related functions of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are described in the literature, the
        relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is likely to be
        revealed. Furthermore, it is easier to identify the related
        functions of these genes because they are precisely those
        functions that related <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to another by computation.
        While the co-occurrence method is biased towards revealing
        gene relationships that have been explicitly described in
        the literature, the method we propose is more sensitive to
        implicit relationships between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that have not
        necessarily been explicitly identified.
        The process of selecting kernel documents can also be
        improved by taking advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> feedback in a
        networked environment. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can be allowed
        to select kernel documents from a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate papers</ENAMEX>.
        The papers selected most frequently by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> can then be
        used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for subsequent automatic kernel document
        selection in searches related to a specific gene or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, it is important to take note of the limitation
        of literature mining tools: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be found to be
        related for many reasons, some of which might not be
        biologically meaningful. The identified relationships could
        therefore have different biological meanings, if any.
        Further investigation is always necessary to determine the
        origin of such relatedness. However, bibiliographic data
        mining efforts such as ours could shed light on the less
        obvious relationships between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. When considered in
        conjunction with other data, such as gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX>, the results could lead to biologically meaningful
        conclusions.
