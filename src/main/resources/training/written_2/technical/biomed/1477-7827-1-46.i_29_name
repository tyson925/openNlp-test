        The luteinizing hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (LHR) plays a
        fundamental role in ovarian responsiveness to pituitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> consists of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue extracellular</ENAMEX> domain
        which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Posttranslational</ENAMEX> changes in glycosylation and
        phosphorylation result in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> variants migrating
        between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~93 and 44 kDa</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Lower molecular weight forms (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 and 44</NUMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>) appear to represent a glycosylated extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> expressed in mammalian cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">truncated receptor</ENAMEX>)
        and retain hormone binding specificity. They are not
        secreted from cells, but remain trapped intracellularly [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . In addition to various glycosylated LHR variants,
        western blotting also yielded a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> representing
        an LHR dimer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> variants with
        different affinities, and highest affinity appears to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the fully glycosylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~90 kDa</NUMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Chorionic gonadotropin (CG), which is important for
        corpus luteum (CL) rescue and maintenance of pregnancy,
        also binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX>, although with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> lower binding
        affinity compared with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        The mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> LHR monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (mAb), clone
        3B5, was developed against purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> LHR [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibody</ENAMEX> showed immunoreactivity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> granulosa cells
        of mature (preovulatory) follicles, ovarian thecal and
        interstitial cells, granulosa-lutein cells of developing,
        mature and regressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, and with testicular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leydig</ENAMEX> cells,
        and no reactivity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> kidneys [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . During the last
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>, affinity purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3B5 antibody</ENAMEX> has been used in
        several immunohistochemical studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . To
        our knowledge, however, no analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3B5 antibody</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">western blot</ENAMEX> has been reported.
        In porcine ovaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression was detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granulosa</ENAMEX> and theca cells of preovulatory follicles, but
        not in granulosa lutein cells of the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovaries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression was also detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granulosa</ENAMEX> and theca cells of preovulatory follicles, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mature CL</ENAMEX> showed strong expression in luteal cells, which
        disappeared during luteal regression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> from early human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX> showed various intensities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression
        (from weak to intense) on the surface and in the
        cytoplasmic regions of luteal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        LHR expression was also detected in nonpregnant human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uterus</ENAMEX> (glandular and luminal epithelial cells, stromal
        cells, myometrial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells),
        syncytiotrophoblast of midterm but not term human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placenta</ENAMEX>,
        fetal membranes and decidua [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , human and rat brain [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] , rat prostate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trophoblast</ENAMEX> and
        syncytiotrophoblast from early pregnancies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , porcine
        fallopian tubes and umbilical cord [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 32</NUMEX> ] , ovarian,
        decidual, endometrial and luteal macrophages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 33</NUMEX> ] ,
        and ovarian cancer cell cultures and tumor tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Beside its involvement in the regulation of ovarian
        function, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> appears to be involved in some additional
        effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in porcine fallopian tubes
        was confined to the epithelium and smooth muscle cells, and
        in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> treatment caused relaxation of the oviduct [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        ] . Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> stimulation plays a role in the induction and
        maintenance of myometrial quiescence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Since
        smooth muscles belong among important compartments of the
        pelvic floor, high LH levels after menopause might be
        involved in the increased incidence of pelvic floor
        disorders, a common condition in postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
        ] . Since the brain was reported to express functional LHR
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] , there is also a possibility that high LH levels
        in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may in some way participate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and progression of neurodegenerative process of
        several degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurological diseases</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>.
        The aim of the present study was to investigate
        subcellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX> distribution and determine LHR protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> identified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B5</TIMEX> mAb in various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, human and
        porcine tissues. During cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX>, a
        transition from cytoplasmic to perinuclear, surface,
        nuclear and no LHR immunoreactivity was detected. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, porcine and human ovaries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct LHR</ENAMEX> bands were observed, migrating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between ~92</NUMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 kDa.</TIMEX>
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Rats
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> of the CII-ZV strain, born and maintained in the
          Laboratory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biology of Reproduction, Zaragoza</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>,
          were maintained on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">14L-10D</ENAMEX> cycle (lights on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0500-1900</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">postnatal rats</ENAMEX> were weaned at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days of age</TIMEX>, and
          they attained sexual maturity during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6th week</TIMEX> of
          life. Ovaries were studied in proestrous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, at the age
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>. Daily vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smears</ENAMEX> were collected for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about ten days</TIMEX> prior to sacrifice.
        
        
          Porcine tissues
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">porcine</ENAMEX> ovaries with fallopian tubes and some
          additional porcine tissues were obtained from a local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abattoir</ENAMEX> and tissue samples were frozen within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX>.
          With respect to the follicular and luteal development,
          porcine ovaries were macroscopically classified as
          follows: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early/mid</TIMEX> follicular - medium sized antral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5 mm</ENAMEX>) accompanied by shrinking fibrous
          corpora lutea of similar size; late follicular - large
          antral follicles (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>5 mm</NUMEX>) not accompanied by any luteal
          tissue; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early/ mid</TIMEX> luteal - large corpora lutea (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10 mm</NUMEX>)
          characterized by yellowish color; and late luteal - CL of
          diminishing size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~7 mm</NUMEX>) with massive bleeding into the
          central cavity (bluish color) and no accompanying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicles</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Human tissues
          Frozen blocks of human tissues from previous studies
          were obtained as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ]
          . Some tissues also originated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Network</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>. Functional stage of
          ovaries was classified according to the endometrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovaries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endometrial samples</ENAMEX> were
          obtained from hysterectomy specimens. We also utilized
          frozen blocks and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> from human placental
          chorionic villi, and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> from trophoblast
          cultures and cultured amniotic fibroblasts and placental
          mononuclear cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Placental mononuclear cells
          were collected from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> digestion, which contains
          no trophoblast cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . The study was approved by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Use Committee</ENAMEX> and

          with specimens were frozen by floating on liquid nitrogen
          and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-80Â°C until</TIMEX> use. Frozen tissues were sliced
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Î¼m serial sections using a cryostat microtome with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to twelve distinct tissue sections were
          placed on each slide. The slides were dried <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX> h at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, fixed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min in acetone, dried <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, and
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C until</TIMEX> immunoperoxidase staining was
          performed. Prior to staining, to prevent water
          condensation, the slides were transferred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-80Â°C</TIMEX> into
          pre-chilled air protected boxes containing Drierite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granules</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.A. Hammond Drierite Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenia, OH</ENAMEX>), and
          the boxes with slides were equilibrated to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+4</NUMEX>
          (cold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>) and room temperature (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> each step)
          before opening.
          Slides were incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> (cold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>) with
          primary antibodies (see below). Specimens were then
          transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature, extensively washed in
          freshly prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.22</NUMEX>, and incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>

          preabsorbed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> kidney homogenate to remove
          nonspecific background [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> slides were
          similarly processed, but primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was replaced
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antigen-antibody</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were detected by
          standard diaminobenzidine technique (brown color). Some
          slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, and all
          slides were dehydrated and mounted. Dual color
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> experiments were performed as

        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat tissues</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat ovaries</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was detected
          in the mature and regressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A)
          and ovarian interstitial cells (i), follicular theca
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interna</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B), and mature granulosa cells (mg,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Bvs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1C</TIMEX>). Note a lack of immunoreactivity
          in ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (v, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). The antibody also
          identified granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity in
          immature granulosa cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) of preantral and
          early antral follicles, suggestive of early LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>. This may represent synthesis of a receptor
          extracellular domain not yet associated with the cell
          surface, but remaining trapped intracellularly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Maturation of preovulatory follicles was associated
          with a transition of scarce granular cytoplasmic LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> accumulation in
          more differentiated granulosa cells (dg). LHR
          immunoreactivity was also found in surface epithelium of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat uterine cavity</ENAMEX>, epithelium of uterine glands (se
          and ug, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E), nuclei of stromal cells (arrowhead),
          and in uterine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (v). The latter contrasted with a
          lack of staining of ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (see above).
        
        
          Human tissues (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          During <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">follicular</ENAMEX> selection (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX> follicular phase, as
          determined by endometrium morphology) dominant follicles
          in human ovaries showed granular cytoplasmic LHR
          expression in granulosa cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), similar to
          those in immature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat follicles</ENAMEX> (see above). Theca
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interna</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ti</ENAMEX>) showed more distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity,
          characterized by accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granules</ENAMEX>. Follicular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (vascular layer, vl, and
          thecal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, tv) were virtually unstained. Some LHR
          immunoreactivity was also detected in theca externa cells
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">te</NUMEX>).
          Early luteal development (fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CL</ENAMEX>) was associated
          with very strong cytoplasmic LHR immunostaining of
          granulosa lutein cells migrating into the follicular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX> (gl, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Adjacent theca-lutein cells (tl)
          also exhibited prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, but showed distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuolization</ENAMEX>. No LHR expression accompanied developing
          luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (v). In the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, granulosa lutein
          cells showed diminution of cytoplasmic LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> and strong surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">staining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C).
          Luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late luteal period</TIMEX>) showed
          marked diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D). Regression
          of luteal tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> investigated during the follicular
          phase) showed residual staining of theca-lutein cells and
          no staining of regressing granulosa lutein cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2Evs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ctr</ENAMEX>).
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of pregnancy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLP</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>), less or more
          distinct granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity
          (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Fvs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ctr</ENAMEX>) and no surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">staining</ENAMEX> was
          detected. This suggests that high CG levels accompanying
          early pregnancy may preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLP</ENAMEX> through the cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. In other words, selective pick up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX> through
          the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX> expression in granulosa lutein cells
          during the luteal phase after conception appears not to
          be required if the circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX> is very high.
          In fallopian tubes, distinct cytoplasmic LHR
          expression was associated with the luminal aspect of
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2G). In endometrium
          (late follicular phase - note stromal edema), LHR
          immunoreactivity was associated with endometrial glands
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2H) and with the surface epithelium of the
          uterine cavity (se). There was also granular cytoplasmic
          expression in endometrial stromal cells (s), precursors
          of decidual cells, and similar granular staining was
          observed in smooth muscle cells of late follicular phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myometrium</ENAMEX> (data not shown). 3B5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> also stained
          human brain vessels (v, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2I) and showed strong LHR
          immunoreactivity with microglial cells (arrowhead; see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Porcine tissues (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          Porcine preovulatory follicles showed distinct LHR
          staining of theca interna, lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression in
          vascular layer under the follicular membrane, and
          transition of granular cytoplasmic to surface LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in granulosa cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,3C</ENAMEX>, vs.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control D</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mature CL</ENAMEX> showed strong surface LHR
          immunoreactivity of luteal cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7E), and old
          corpora lutea showed diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoexpression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F). Ovarian surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>, the source of most
          ovarian tumors, was also stained (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3G). In
          porcine fallopian tube (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3H), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunostaining
          was similar to that in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oviduct</ENAMEX>. Strong LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in vascular walls was detected in the
          skin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3I), which does not represent a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX>
          target. This contrasted with a lack of staining in
          ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, except weak nuclear staining of
          endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3J). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          Observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in porcine
          tissues indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX> distribution is similar to that
          in human tissues. They also show LHR expression in the
          ovarian surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> (not investigated in human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovaries</ENAMEX>) and astonishing differences in vascular walls of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonclassic</ENAMEX> (strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> in skin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>) and classic LHR
          targets (week expression in ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>) - see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] and Discussion beneath for a role of vascular LHR

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat ovaries</ENAMEX> and human and porcine mature CL with 3B5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibody</ENAMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct bands migrating between ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>

          Although weak, some LHR immunoreactivity was also
          detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> extract (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> is consistent with a lack of LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat kidney cryostat</ENAMEX> sections reported
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distinct LHR</ENAMEX> expression was detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> proestrous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovaries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), which contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> at
          various stages of development and regression, and
          developing and mature preovulatory follicles. However, in
          porcine preovulatory ovaries (late follicular phase),
          which contain numerous preovulatory follicles but no
          luteal tissue, very strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Regression of porcine luteal
          tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCL</ENAMEX>; lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) was associated with a marked decline
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression. This confirmed immunohistochemical
          observations.
          In human tissues, mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCL</ENAMEX>; lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) showed LHR
          bands similar to that in mature porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>. Very strong
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LHR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> was detected in the

          contact with the developing embryo secreting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX>, a signal
          required for CL preservation.
          Placental chorionic villi (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>; lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) also showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          distinct bands similar to those detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and porcine ovaries. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time 0</TIMEX> and early and
          late trophoblast cultures derived from the same placenta
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-11</TIMEX>) showed additional high molecular weight LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~170 kDa</NUMEX>), possibly LHR homodimers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
          which were barely detectable or undetectable in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, including placental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>. Moreover, there were
          additional bands detected in trophoblast cultures (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~85</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kDa species</ENAMEX>) and a lack of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~52</NUMEX> kDa variant
          as compared to the luteal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV protein extracts</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kDa species</ENAMEX>, probably a partially degraded form
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> turnover [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , was observed in placental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-13</TIMEX>) and pelvic floor compartments
          (lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-16</NUMEX>).
          We also investigated cultures of placental mesenchymal
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>), which are always associated with trophoblast
          cultures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] , and amniotic fibroblasts (FB).
          Placental mesenchymal cells showed a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> band
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~68 kDa</NUMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Note the virtual lack of other
          bands characteristic of trophoblast cultures. Placental
          amniotic fibroblasts showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct LHR bands
          migrating at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~59 and 48 kDa</NUMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>). Similar ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 and 48</NUMEX>
          kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were distinctly expressed in trophoblast
          cultures.
          Western blot analysis of pelvic floor compartments
          showed strong expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~92 and 68</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from the vaginal wall (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VagW</ENAMEX>; lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>),
          which consists of vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epithelium</ENAMEX>, longitudinal and
          circular smooth muscle cell bundles, and connective
          tissue. A less prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was detected at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~80 kDa</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> similar bands were also found in human levator ani
          muscle and fascia (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 16</TIMEX>). These observations
          indicate that pelvic floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX> represent
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> effect. Absorption with
          porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ovaries</ENAMEX> resulted in severe diminution of 3B5
          reactivity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, porcine and human tissues in western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blots</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Bvs. 5A).
          Altogether, these data indicate that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3B5</NUMEX> antibody
          identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR protein</ENAMEX> variants showing distinct
          expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, porcine and human tissues, including
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placenta</ENAMEX>, with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> also detected in human
          female pelvic floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Human chorionic villi and placental membranes
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
          In normal placentae at term, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
          in mature chorionic villi was found in mononucleated
          cytotrophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> under the syncytial layer
          (arrowheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6A</ENAMEX>) and villous vascular sinusoids (v),
          but most of the syncytiotrophoblast was virtually
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstained</ENAMEX> (white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">asterisks</ENAMEX> vs. black). Mononucleated
          trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed variable nuclear LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, detail from A). The most
          prominent nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was found in trophoblast cells
          merging with the syncytium (full arrowheads vs. white).
          The red arrowhead indicates diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression
          in the cell which joined the syncytial layer. Staining of
          villous sinusoids was associated with basal (abluminal)
          aspects of endothelial cells (arrowheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C).
          Developing (immature) chorionic villi were occasionally
          observed and showed more pronounced granular cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in the syncytial layer (asterisk,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D), a feature also detected in immature granulosa
          cells (see above).
          In contrast to normal placentae, granular cytoplasmic
          staining of the syncytial layer dominated in some
          moderately abnormal placentae (asterisks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6E), which
          showed mild compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids
          (v) - see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] for definition of placental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormality</ENAMEX>. In such placentae, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX>+ mononucleated
          trophoblast cells were barely detectable, as well as LHR
          expression in villous sinusoids (white arrowheads).
          Differences between placental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> were more obvious
          at lower magnification. Figure 6F(vs. control 6I), shows
          normal placenta with prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> staining of villous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sinusoids</ENAMEX> (full arrowhead) and no staining of syncytium
          (white asterisk). Figure 6Gshows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunostaining of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syncytium</ENAMEX> (black asterisk) and lack of vascular LHR
          (white arrowhead), resembling immature chorionic villi
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immature placental phenotypes</ENAMEX>, characteristic for
          intrauterine growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> and maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] - note lack of dilatation of villous sinusoids).
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6Hshows</TIMEX> that neither surface (white asterisk) nor
          significant vascular LHR immunoreactivity (white
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowhead</ENAMEX>) was detected in placentae with extreme
          dilatation of villous sinusoids (aged placental phenotype
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] ).
          In placental membranes, occasionally found
          multilayered amniotic epithelium showed no or fine
          granular cytoplasmic staining of epithelial cells
          adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> (full arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6J), followed by perinuclear (yellow arrowhead) and
          nuclear LHR immunoexpression (red arrowhead). Cells most
          distant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> showed no staining
          (white arrowhead).
          Extravillous trophoblast cells in placental membranes
          and placental basal plate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6K) exhibited usually
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perinuclear</ENAMEX> (full arrowheads) and occasionally nuclear
          LHR expression (data not shown). In contrast, however,
          nuclear or no staining was prevalent in adjacent decidual
          cells (white arrowheads). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Lshows a semi-parallel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>, a characteristic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> of human decidual cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Note Thy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+
          decidual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (white arrowhead) and unstained
          extravillous trophoblast cells (full arrowhead). Dual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> immunohistochemistry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brown</ENAMEX>) and CD68
          (blue; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6M) indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX>+ decidual cells also
          show expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD68</TIMEX> (white arrowhead - note brown and
          blue color) of decidual macrophages (red arrowhead),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> also characteristic for regressing luteal
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Note a lack of macrophages among
          trophoblast cells.
        
        
          Pelvic floor (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
          Previously documented LH-dependent relaxation of the
          porcine oviduct [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] raises a question if high LH
          levels in postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do not contribute to the
          relaxation of the pelvic floor, and hence to the
          increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. We investigated connective tissues and muscular
          compartments of the pelvic floor, in order to determine
          cellular equivalents to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> bands detected in western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blots</ENAMEX> and possible cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for the LH
          effect.
          Strong cytoplasmic and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
          was found in smooth muscle cells in the vaginal wall
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Avs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ctr</ENAMEX>). Vaginal connective tissue fibroblasts
          (white arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B) and other stromal elements
          (full arrowhead), as well as vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowhead</ENAMEX>), also showed distinct LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX>.
          In vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epithelial layers</ENAMEX>, a model for
          differentiation of epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , basal (stem)
          cells were unstained (b, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C), dense cytoplasmic
          staining was found in parabasal (immature) cells (full
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowhead</ENAMEX>), followed by perinuclear (yellow arrowhead)
          and cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (green arrowhead).
          Nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was found in lower superficial cells
          (red arrowhead in adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), and cornified
          superficial cells showed overall diminution of LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (white arrowhead).
          Additional pelvic floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, the levator ani
          fascia, was studied and exhibited nuclear LHR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (fibroblasts; white
          arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7D) and other mesenchymal cells with
          rounded nuclei (full arrowhead), most probably resident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> (see below). Mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in levator ani
          muscle also showed LHR immunoreactivity (full arrowheads,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7F</ENAMEX>). In addition, nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LHR staining</ENAMEX> was
          also detected in levator ani striated muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, some
          of which were centrally (abnormally) located in this
          sample (white arrowheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7F</ENAMEX>). Note unstained
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (v) accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX>+ stromal cells.
          Distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> macrophages, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7G,7H<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,7</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, suggests that rounded mesenchymal cells showing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in pelvic floor connective tissues
          might be represented by this type of cells. Note
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> macrophages with vasculature
          (v).
          These observations indicate that principal components
          of the pelvic floor (smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">striated</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>), which are responsible for pelvic
          floor integrity, are potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> hormonal
          effects. Additional cells exhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
          in pelvic floor connective tissues appear to be resident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Human brain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>)
          Neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, also show increased incidence in aging
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a question arises if the rise in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX>, reflecting diminution of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, can also
          contribute to the initiation and progression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurodegeneration</ENAMEX>. We studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression in the gray
          matter of the human parietal lobe cortex. Strong LHR
          immunoreactivity was associated with small cells with
          flattened nuclei (yellow arrowheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A) and
          numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spiny</ENAMEX> processes (full arrowhead). Adjacent nerve
          cells were unstained (green arrowheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B), but
          distant nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed moderate staining (red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowheads</ENAMEX>).
          Staining for the leukocyte common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C)
          and observation for characteristic morphology and nuclear
          shape (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Ivs. 8F,8<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,8<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H; Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Kvs. 8J- adapted from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] ) as well as expression of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CD68</NUMEX> of resident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8L) indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Aidentifies microglial cells of mesenchymal
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mesodermal</NUMEX>) origin. Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Mindicates that these
          cells do not express CD14 of monocytes (and primitive
          tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ). This suggests that they are
          highly differentiated dendritic type cells. Figure
          8Dshows diffuse expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> in the cortex,
          identified with anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thy-1 antibody</ENAMEX>. Figure 8Eis a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> Thy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (not reacting
          with human tissues).
          These data indicate that microglial cells and some
          nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the gray matter of the human brain cortex
          may be influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> proteohormones. Yet, loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> matter from areas of the parietal and temporal lobes
          is the most obvious consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our observations indicate that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3B5</NUMEX> anti-LHR antibody
        reacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, porcine and human tissues. In western
        blots, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3B5 antibody</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct bands
        migrating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between ~92 and 48 kDa</NUMEX>, and this reactivity with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> species diminishes when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is preabsorbed with porcine ovaries. We also show
        changes in subcellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX> distribution during
        differentiation of various cell types. To our knowledge,
        LHR expression in fibroblasts, striated muscle cells, and
        microglial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD68</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> macrophages) in the
        central nervous system is presented for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. We
        also report tissue differences in vascular LHR
        expression.
        During cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX>, subcellular LHR
        distribution changed from granular cytoplasmic to
        perinuclear, surface and nuclear staining; virtually no
        staining was detected in stem cells and most differentiated
        and aged cells. Yet, cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">staining</ENAMEX> was observed
        only on classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> targets, granulosa and theca cells of
        preovulatory follicles and mature luteal cells, but also in
        the vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epithelium</ENAMEX>. This indicates that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
        prepared for the selective accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> signals
        from the circulation.
        There was also a striking difference in vascular LHR
        expression between ovaries and other tissues. In ovarian
        (and also striated muscle) vessels the LHR expression was
        virtually absent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3J</TIMEX>), while other tissues
        investigated, including uterus, brain, skin and vagina,
        showed distinct vascular LHR immunoreactivity. We also
        reported previously that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat the endothelial</ENAMEX> LHR
        expression is absent in testicular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in
        other tissues involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> transport into (pituitary)
        and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Saturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> in
        ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> may be dependent on the precise delivery of
        small amounts of circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extravascular</ENAMEX> space. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> mediated endothelial
        transport of hCG has been suggested to represent a model
        for general involvement of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in transport
        of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58</NUMEX> ] . Yet, application of
        this theory on our data will indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> will
        be delivered to the uterus, brain, skin and vagina rather
        than to the ovary. Hence, the opposite mechanism should be
        considered - endothelial LHR expression may suppress the
        transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> to the extravascular space.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> molecule is smaller than that of albumin or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> exhibiting ubiquitous distribution, so there
        is no need to enhance rather only prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> transport
        to inappropriate sites. Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> to endothelial
        cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> may prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> transport from
        circulation by electrostatic forces, and the lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelial</ENAMEX> LHR expression may be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX>
        transport mediated by a general mechanism involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protein exchange</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        We report that normal term placentae show virtually no
        LHR expression in trophoblastic syncytium while syncytium
        of some abnormal placentae (immature phenotypes) exhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity. This resembles high LHR expression in
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trimester placenta [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , which is a source of high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCG</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Yet, hCG levels fall during the second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trimester</ENAMEX>, and elevated maternal midtrimester hCG is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with higher rates of maternal and neonatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX> (pregnancy-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>,
        preeclampsia, gestational <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and perinatal death) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61 62 63</NUMEX> ] .
        Hence, some abnormal term placentae appear to preserve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syncytium</ENAMEX> in a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, accompanied by high secretion
        of hCG. In contrast, vascular LHR expression was detected
        in sinusoids of chorionic villi from normal term placentae,
        but was virtually absent in all abnormal placentae. If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> LHR expression represents a barrier for hCG
        transport from chorionic villi to the fetal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (see
        above), lack of this barrier may cause high levels of fetal
        hCG resulting in perinatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] ,
        regardless of normal or abnormal hCG production.
        Western blot analysis of placental villi and trophoblast
        cultures indicates that cultured trophoblast cells show
        additional bands, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~170</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, possibly an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homodimer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Although the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~170</NUMEX> kDa species
        persisted in late cultures, other (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">additional</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> variants
        diminished. This suggests an activation of isolated
        trophoblast cells and enhanced LHR synthesis with formation
        of additional glycosylated LHR variants, particularly in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time 0</ENAMEX> and early cultures. When compared to chorionic
        villi, trophoblast cultures showed stronger ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 and 48</NUMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, characteristic for cultured fibroblasts. Indeed,
        it has been reported, that differentiation of cultured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophoblast</ENAMEX> is associated with activation of accompanying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] .
        Early differentiation of granulosa, luteal, and other
        cell types expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> was associated with cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity, reflecting receptor synthesis prior
        its surface expression. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of pregnancy,
        the function of which is highly dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX>, also
        showed cytoplasmic expression. Hence, it is possible that
        high levels of circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX>, e.g., during pregnancy
        and after menopause, may influence not only cells with
        surface LH expression, but also cells with cytoplasmic, and
        perhaps exclusively nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LHR</ENAMEX> expression (pelvic floor
        compartments, including striated muscle). In other words,
        cells lacking surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR</ENAMEX> may not be influenced by
        temporary increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> production during the preovulatory
        period of the ovarian cycle due to the "cell membrane LHR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barrier</ENAMEX>," and the LH effect is probably also prevented by
        the "vascular LHR barrier." Yet, high CG levels during
        pregnancy may pass the "cell membrane barrier" and act
        through the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of pregnancy and
        other cells with cytoplasmic expression, and such effect
        could be enhanced if the "vascular LHR barrier" is absent -
        abnormal placentae of aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phenotype</TIMEX> and similar putative
        age-related vascular changes in other tissues.
        But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> action through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX>/perinuclear
        and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LHRs</ENAMEX> opens a possibility of more direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX>
        action within the cells, which may not require a classic
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger pathway</ENAMEX> (cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> dependent signaling
        mechanism) involvement, or this system can act through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular LHRs</ENAMEX>. Evidence is accumulating that a number
        of other factors modulate the actions of gonadotropins in
        the ovary and testis via activation of alternative
        signaling pathways and via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein variants</ENAMEX>, and
        alternative second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger pathways</ENAMEX> for the transmission
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> activation effect exist, which may not include
        stimulation of cyclic AMP levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 66 67 68 69</NUMEX> ] . A
        question also arises if the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LHR</ENAMEX> expression in
        terminally differentiated cells (e.g., striated muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>) may not indicate a possibility of the direct effect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> on modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, reflecting
        certain effects of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> on their nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> causes a relaxation of smooth muscle cells, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express LHR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). The data presented also
        indicate that additional principal cell types in the pelvic
        floor show LHR expression, including stromal and fascial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and striated muscle cells. This is associated
        with relatively high expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHR protein</ENAMEX> in western
        blots, and a fully glycosylated ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kDa species</ENAMEX> in
        particular. Interestingly, strong <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~59 and 48</NUMEX> kDa proteins
        expressed in cultured fibroblasts were not detected in
        pelvic floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX>, but a distinct ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> from
        mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was apparent. We speculate that a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~92</NUMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the pelvic floor is a result of interaction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident macrophages</ENAMEX> with pelvic floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hCG</ENAMEX> secreted by trophoblastic syncytium during
        pregnancy may play an important role in the physiologic
        adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and preparation of the pelvic floor
        for labor in particular. However, when compared to hCG, LH
        has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher LHR binding affinity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Consequently, high LH levels after menopause may cause
        pathologic relaxation of the pelvic floor resulting in
        pelvic floor disorders.
        Strong LHR expression in microglial cells in the brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> is of particular interest. Microglial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident macrophages</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system, and LHR
        expression has been described in other types of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident macrophages</ENAMEX> (ovary, decidua, endometrium and
        corpora lutea) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 33</NUMEX> ] . Pathological activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> has been reported in a wide range of conditions
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>, cerebral ischemia, prion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS dementia</ENAMEX>, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degenerative</ENAMEX> neurological diseases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 71</NUMEX> ] . Some of
        these degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are associated with advanced
        age and high levels of circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX>. High LH levels might
        pass the presumptive LH barrier of brain vessels expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX>, or vascular LHR expression might diminish with age, as
        in abnormal term placentae. Yet, elevated maternal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-trimester chorionic gonadotropin is associated with
        fetal cerebral blood flow redistribution and adverse
        perinatal outcome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . In addition, estrogens, which
        are known to cause a diminution of high LH levels in
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, have been reported to be effective in
        the prevention and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72 73</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> ] . Microglia belong among cells of the mononuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagocyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX> increases secretion of a
        variety of cytokines by monocytes, and induces their
        inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76 77 78 79</NUMEX>
        ] , high LH levels in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may also activate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident macrophages</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system and
        contribute to the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> and
        other inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Outside of the area occupied by microglial cells in the
        grey matter of the cerebral cortex, weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> expression
        was also detected in some nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>. This suggests that
        such nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could be directly influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteohormones</ENAMEX> (with unknown consequences), while the nerve
        cells among microglial branching processes are protected
        from such an effect.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In conclusion, our observations concur with and expand
        current knowledge on LHR expression in gonadal and
        nongonadal tissues reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. We show
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3B5 antibody</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct LHR protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Subcellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> localization varies during cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast to the theory on the role of vascular hormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in preferential pick up of circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>,
        there may be no need to enhance selective pick up rather
        only prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH/CG</ENAMEX> transport to inappropriate sites.
        Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the
        development of abnormal pregnancy and fetal outcome, and
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHR</ENAMEX> in the pelvic floor compartments suggests
        that high LH levels in postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may contribute
        to pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of
        pelvic floor disorders. High LH levels in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        may also participate in the development of
        inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>.
