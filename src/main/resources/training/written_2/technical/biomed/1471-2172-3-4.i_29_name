        Gene transfer into developing and mature primary T cells
        has been limited by the lack of efficient techniques for ex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> or in vivo transfection or transduction. The
        adaptation of retroviral vectors for gene delivery into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> has gained favor recently [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , but has
        several features that limit its use. First, retroviral gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> requires cell cycle progression of the
        cellular host to permit viral genome integration, limiting
        studies of regulatory genes that are operative early in T
        cell activation or differentiation. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, because the
        integration site of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is variable, there can
        be local, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> chromatin effects on exogenous gene
        expression and unpredictable silencing of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">integrants</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, efficiencies of transduction with retroviral vectors
        are often limiting. Finally, the retroviral genome is
        small, limiting the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous genes</ENAMEX> that can be
        packaged.
        Replication-defective adenoviral vectors offer several
        advantages that make them attractive for gene delivery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Adenoviral vectors are able to transduce
        proliferating or quiescent cells; they can accommodate
        dual, large insert sizes and can deliver additional genes
        by superinfection; and stable, high-titer viral stocks are
        easily generated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Further, since the adenoviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> is maintained extra-chromosomally, insertion
        site-dependent effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genome are minimized,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous genes</ENAMEX> can be reliably expressed at high
        levels. Unfortunately, naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> are not
        susceptible to infection with adenoviruses due to lack of
        detectable expression of a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, such as the
        coxsackie/adenovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAR</ENAMEX>), which is required for
        efficient viral attachment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . The CAR protein
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra-cellular immunoglobulin-like (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>)
        domains, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of which appears sufficient for binding
        to the adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber knob protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Expression
        of either human or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">murine CAR</ENAMEX> in various cell lines has
        been shown to facilitate gene transfer by recombinant human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenoviruses</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 13</NUMEX> ] . Stable transfection of
        transformed murine B and T cells lines with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human CAR</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hCAR</NUMEX>) lacking its cytoplasmic domain rendered them
        susceptible to adenoviral transfection, establishing that
        lymphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be permissive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> for adenoviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> and demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAR</ENAMEX> is not required for viral entry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . More
        recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> transgenic for full length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] or
        truncated hCAR [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] have been described in which
        adenoviral transduction of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> has been
        demonstrated.
        We describe here <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new transgenic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>) mouse lines
        in which expression of human CAR with a truncated
        cytoplasmic domain (hCARΔcyt) is limited to thymocytes and
        lymphocytes under direction of a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> lines are similar in having transgene
        expression restricted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lymphoid</ENAMEX> lineage, but differ
        in the pattern of hCARΔcyt expression profiles within
        lymphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. In each transgenic line, expression
        of the hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene imparted</ENAMEX> susceptibility to
        efficient adenoviral transduction that was independent of
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>. By crossing the hCARΔcyt.CD2 Tg <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11.10 TCR Tg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we have generated an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific model with which to study the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adenovirally</ENAMEX> delivered genes on T cell activation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. Transduction of hCARΔcyt-positive naïve,
        Th1 or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2 DO11.10 T</ENAMEX> cells with a recombinant adenoviral
        vector resulted in high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene expression
        without detectable activation of transduced cells or
        deleterious effect on their antigenic responses.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX>.CD2 transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>: characterization of
          distinct hCAR expression profiles in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
          founder lines
          To develop a transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with high-level
          expression of hCAR on murine T cells, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> was
          constructed based on a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>gene described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>gene includes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">hCD2</NUMEX> gene as well as the hCD2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCR</ENAMEX>, which is reported to direct transgene expression to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells in a position-independent, copy number-dependent
          manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Since the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAR</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undefined</ENAMEX>, and deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of hCAR
          does not adversely affect adenoviral transduction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 19</NUMEX>
          ] , a cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic tail-truncated variant
          of hCAR (hCARΔcyt) was generated and inserted into the
          CD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>gene to eliminate any potential signaling
          capacity of hCAR. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> founder <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> bearing an intact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX>, all demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lymphoid</ENAMEX> lineage-specific
          expression of hCARΔcyt, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct expression
          profiles represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> lines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 13</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band</ENAMEX> data not shown). To develop an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific T cell system with which to deliver
          genes of interest, each of these lines was then crossed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11.10 TCR Tg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] to generate the
          DO11.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX> double transgenic lines shown (Figure
          1B& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1C</ENAMEX>).
          Lymph node cells were isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in
          DO11.hCARΔcyt lines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 13 and 18</TIMEX>, stained with antibodies
          to CD4, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD19</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RmcB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-hCAR</ENAMEX>) and analyzed by
          flow cytometry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). All of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T
          cells from line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 18</TIMEX> expressed high levels of the
          hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells from line
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> had a bimodal pattern of expression, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 35%</NUMEX> of both CD4 +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +negative for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX>. While both lines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 and 18</TIMEX> had negligible
          expression in the B cell compartment, the vast majority
          of B cells from line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> expressed the hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>,
          although at a lower level than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (mean
          fluorescence intensity (MFI): <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD19</NUMEX> +B cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T
          cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">193</NUMEX>). hCARΔcyt was not detected in non-lymphoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> nor on lymphocytes from non-transgenic littermate
          controls (data not shown).
          To determine at what developmental stage the hCARΔcyt
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> is expressed in T cells, thymocytes were
          isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-week-old mice</ENAMEX> and the expression of
          hCARΔcyt relative to the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaluated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). Consistent with the expression of
          hCARΔcyt on mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells from lines 6 and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>, all of the thymocytes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +double
          positive (DP) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +single positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>)
          fractions were positive for hCARΔcyt. In line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 68%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP cells</ENAMEX> expressed
          hCARΔcyt, consistent with the expression of hCARΔcyt on T
          cells in the periphery. A lower percentage of hCARΔcyt
          positive cells was observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4 -CD8</TIMEX> -double
          negative fraction in all lines studied, which likely
          reflects the heterogeneous nature of the double negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The skewed pattern of thymocyte development
          toward CD4 +single positive in each of the lines was
          similar to that observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DO11.10</NUMEX>.hCARΔcyt -control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Thus, in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
          lines studied, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LCR</ENAMEX>/enhancer directed the
          expression of the hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> to the T cell and in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the lines, the B cell lineage. Line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> was chosen
          for further study as the recipient of adenoviral-mediated
          gene delivery due to its uniform, T cell-specific
          expression of the hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Primary T cells and thymocytes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are efficiently transduced by adenoviral
          vectors
          To determine whether lymphocytes from hCARΔcyt.CD2
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were susceptible to adenoviral
          transduction, lymph node cells were isolated from line
          DO11.hCARΔcyt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> and incubated with adenoviral vectors
          designed to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> under the control of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CMV5</TIMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> percent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">resting CD4</ENAMEX> +cells that were transduced with the
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 36%</NUMEX> of resting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +cells
          transduced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +, and the mean
          fluorescence intensity was lower, suggesting an inability
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CMV5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> to induce strong GFP expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resting T</ENAMEX> cells. Following activation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and
          ionomycin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CMV5</NUMEX>-driven expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells. A small percentage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> -cells,
          representing the hCARΔcyt +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +fraction, were transduced
          with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CMV5</ENAMEX> viruses as well.
          To determine whether adenoviral transduction changed
          their activation status, resting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells were
          examined for expression of the early activation markers
          CD62L (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-selectin) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD25</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2Rα</ENAMEX>). After transduction
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA/ionomycin</ENAMEX>,
          the GFP positive and the GFP negative fractions of CD4
          +cells were both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD62L</TIMEX> high and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD25</TIMEX> low, confirming that
          the cells were initially of a resting phenotype and that
          adenoviral transduction did not activate them. Upon
          activation with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX>/ionomycin, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells
          down-regulated CD62L and up-regulated CD25 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control T</ENAMEX> cells from hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX> had indistinguishable flow cytometric profile
          (data not shown).
          Because the expression of hCARΔcyt was detected early
          in thymocyte development (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C), the ability of these
          cells to be transduced by adenovirus was also determined.
          Thymocytes from line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> were incubated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.GFP
          as stated above, and were evaluated by flow cytometry for
          their expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B).
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy-five</TIMEX> percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 SP</ENAMEX> cells were transduced
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expression, consistent with the transduction
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells in the periphery. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX>
          half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8 SP</ENAMEX> could be transduced as well.
          Interestingly, whereas a high percentage of the DN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> expressed GFP after transduction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>), the DP
          fraction was relatively refractory to transduction even
          though all of the DP cells expressed hCARΔcyt; less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the transduced DP cells were GFP-positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irrespective of the MOI</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Band data not
          shown).
        
        
          Adenoviral transduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> lines
          derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          To examine the susceptibility of effector T cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> to adenoviral transduction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells
          were derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by in vitro
          culture under polarizing cytokine conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">resulting Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> lines were incubated with
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, with or without activation
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX>/ionomycin, and expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> was measured by
          flow cytometry <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours later</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Similar to naïve T cells, resting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells were
          readily transduced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX>/ionomycin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> had little effect on either the frequency or
          expression levels of GFP positive cells. In contrast,
          both the frequencies and levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expression were
          increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-transduced Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> lines
          following activation with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX>/ionomycin, anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> or OVA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX>. Further, the activation-induced expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> by cells transduced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5 vector yielded
          significantly better expression levels than those induced
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ad5</TIMEX>.UbP vector. Thus, both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1 and Th2</TIMEX> effectors
          derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> for
          adenoviral transduction, and were equivalent to or better
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">naïve DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt cells with respect to their
          transduction efficiencies and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> expression

          Adenoviral transduction does not alter the
          functional responses or differentiative potential of
          primary T cells
          Although adenoviral transduction did not induce
          detectable activation of resting, naïve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), we wished to further determine whether
          transduction altered the activation-induced functions of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The proliferative responses and
          potential for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1 and Th2</TIMEX> phenotype development were
          therefore examined following adenoviral transduction. CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells isolated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          transduced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, and were sorted after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> based on their expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. The sorted cells
          were cultured with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX> and
          increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OVA</ENAMEX> peptide for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and
          then pulsed with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]thymidine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Figure
          4Ashows that the GFP positive population of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-transduced
          cells had a comparable proliferative response to the
          non-transduced GFP negative cells across the entire
          antigen dose range. Thus, adenoviral transduction did not
          significantly affect primary CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell
          proliferation.
          Transduced, sorted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP -CD4 T</ENAMEX> cells were
          cultured under <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Th1-/Th2</ENAMEX>-polarizing conditions and
          examined for cytokine production following re-stimulation
          to determine potential effects of adenoviral transduction
          on effector phenotype development (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Following
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> of polarization, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells were tested
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> for their ability to produce cytokines
          indicative of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different T cell subsets (Figure
          4B). Th1- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-polarized cells from both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduced</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +) and non-transduced (GFP -) populations
          produced comparable amounts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-specific (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ</ENAMEX>) or
          Th2-specific (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>) cytokines, respectively.
          Cytokine production by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2-polarized DO11.10 T</ENAMEX>
          cells from hCARΔcyt-negative littermate controls was not
          significantly different (data not shown). Thus, neither
          hCAR expression nor adenoviral transduction alters the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naïve T</ENAMEX> cell's potential for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> phenotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.

          cells
          To further investigate the effects of adenoviral
          transduction on T cell biology, and to examine the
          possibility that hCAR expression (an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> superfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of undetermined function) might alter the in vivo
          distribution of transduced T cells, we examined the
          tissue distribution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt T</ENAMEX> cells following
          adoptive transfer into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recipients</ENAMEX>. For these
          experiments, we used line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt Tg <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that
          have a bimodal distribution of hCAR expression to provide
          an internal control, "sham transfection" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. CD4
          +cells were isolated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> lymph and
          spleen cells and transduced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> later, transduced T cells were recovered and
          examined for GFP expression by flow cytometry prior to
          transfer of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 × 10 6cells</NUMEX> into each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> mouse. In a
          representative experiment shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> percent
          of the pre-transfer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +cells expressed the clonotypic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> KJ-126 and of these cells, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.5%</NUMEX> had been
          transduced for GFP expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Forty-eight hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.V.</ENAMEX> injection of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduced</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hCARΔcyt.13</NUMEX>) or control (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DO11.10</NUMEX>) cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">recipient mice</ENAMEX> were sacrificed and secondary lymphoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, spleen and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peyer</ENAMEX>'s patches) were
          divided for detection of the transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> +and GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells by flow cytometry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) or
          immuno-histochemistry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). Flow cytometric analysis
          determined that the transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          Ad-transduced cells from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt Tg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> retained
          the pre-transfer frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +and GFP -cells
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11.10 T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> +) fraction and
          were equivalent to control DO11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> cells with respect to
          the relative distribution between secondary lymphoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A& <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>; data not shown). Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.5%</NUMEX> of
          the recovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> positive cells isolated from pooled
          lymph nodes expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, compared to a pre-transfer
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.5%</NUMEX>. Similar results were obtained in
          recovered splenic tissues, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 and 96 hours</TIMEX>
          post-transfer (data not shown). There was an increase in
          the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-transduced
          cells in the interval between transfer and recovery
          (pre-transfer MFI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>; post-transfer MFI: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">320</ENAMEX>),
          suggesting continued GFP transcription in vivo. Thus,
          there was no preferential loss or increase of the
          Ad-transduced cells in vivo, nor were there gross
          differences in trafficking to secondary lymphoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>.
          To determine if adenoviral transduction or GFP
          reporter expression altered T cell trafficking to tissue
          microenvironments, recovered lymphoid tissues were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sectioned</ENAMEX> and processed for fluorescent microscopic
          analysis (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Band Table 2</ENAMEX>). A double-label
          immunofluorescent protocol was developed to permit in
          situ localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> +T cells and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">B220</NUMEX> +B
          cells in fixed, frozen tissue sections (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown). Irrespective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of T
          cells transferred (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DO11.10</NUMEX> wild-type control or
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbC</ENAMEX>.GFP-transduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX>), a similar
          distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> +and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +T cells was found within
          the secondary lymphoid tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microenvironments</ENAMEX>. In the
          spleen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KJ1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> +or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> +cells were primarily located
          within the periarterial lymphoid sheaths (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALS</ENAMEX>), with
          fewer positive cells in the marginal zones, and only
          scattered positive cells in the red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Relatively few positive cells were detected within the B
          cell follicles, although positive cells could be found in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALS</ENAMEX>, at the border with B cell follicles. Similarly,
          in lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peyer</ENAMEX>'s patches, the wild-type and
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">transduced</NUMEX> transgenic T cells localized primarily to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paracortical T</ENAMEX> cell areas. Collectively, these data
          indicate that neither hCARΔcyt or GFP expression nor
          adenoviral transduction affects survival or trafficking
          of adoptively transferred cells for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 4 days</TIMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The introduction of transgenic systems adapted to take
        advantage of adenoviral gene delivery technology offers an
        attractive adjunct to existing gene delivery strategies for
        studies of lymphocyte biology. In an effort to facilitate
        gene transfer into primary lymphocytes, we and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] have employed different strategies to engineer
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that express the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adenoviral</ENAMEX> receptor,
        hCAR, on murine lymphocytes. Here we report the
        characterization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new transgenic lines that express
        a cytoplasmic-tail truncated hCAR under control of hCD2
        gene regulatory elements, and demonstrate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for
        gene transfer studies of primary T cells and thymocytes. In
        agreement with previous studies using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>gene
        expression cassette [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] , the truncated hCAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> was expressed in all cells of the T cell lineage,
        and except for transgenic line 6 (hCARΔcyt.CD2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>), in which
        there was expression on mature B cells as well as T cells,
        hCAR was not expressed by non-T cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the
        expression of hCARΔcyt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells was stable and high-level
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> stages of development, from double-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Th1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>. With the possible
        exception of double positive thymocytes (see below),
        reporter expression by transduced hCARΔcyt-positive cells
        at each of these developmental stages was very efficient.
        Thus, it is possible to target adenoviral transduction to
        the T cell compartment in vitro and in vivo. Of particular
        note, the level of expression of hCARΔcyt was not
        significantly lower for double-negative and double-positive
        thymocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in line hCARΔcyt.CD2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        contrary to what was observed previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The
        high-level expression of hCARΔcyt by double-negative (CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-CD8 -</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thymocytes</ENAMEX> rendered this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> readily
        transducible, suggesting that these early thymocytes
        express sufficient integrin co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (e.g. α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v β3</ENAMEX> or α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v β5</ENAMEX>) for adenoviral entry and making
        this a useful model for early thymocyte gene targeting
        Despite expression of levels of hCARΔcyt comparable to
        that of double-negative and single-positive thymocytes,
        double-positive thymocytes were relatively refractory to
        reporter expression following transduction with either the
        Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.GFP vector. The lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        expression could reflect poor entry of adenovirus in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or poor transcriptional activity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> used (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CMV5</ENAMEX>), among other possibilites.
        Given the comparable levels of hCARΔcyt expression by
        double-positive and double-negative or single positive
        thymocytes, it is unlikely that viral entry is limiting in
        these cells, although this has not been formally tested. We
        favor the possibility that the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> expression
        reflects inefficient transcriptional activity of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> at this developmental stage. In this same vein,
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> by freshly isolated mature T
        cells transduced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UbP</ENAMEX>.GFP vector was very
        efficient, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ad5</TIMEX>.CMV5.GFP vector required a
        post-transduction activation of T cells to induce optimal
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . On the contrary, the CMV5
        promoter yielded better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> expression in activated,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells. Thus, the choice of promoter
        will need to be optimized for each adenoviral vector
        depending on the developmental stage and specific purpose
        for its use. Studies with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX> (e.g.
        CD2) are in progress and should be informative.
        Interestingly, the bimodal pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells and thymocytes from line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX>.CD2.13 suggested some positional effect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variegation</ENAMEX> (PEV) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, an effect not
        previously reported in trangenes that include the entire
        CD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Further, we have noticed that the
        percentage of hCARΔcyt positive T cells in the line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt</ENAMEX>.CD2.13 increased with successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of
        back-cross of the original hCARΔcyt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">B6xSJL F1</ENAMEX>)
        onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/c background, reflecting a strain background
        effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEV</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Although the mechanism
        of this expression heterogeneity is not clear, it is
        fortuitous in providing different lines that offer distinct
        targeting profiles. Accordingly, it should prove possible
        to target both B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in line hCARΔcyt.CD2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        whereas line hCARΔcyt.CD2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can be exploited to
        perform transduction studies in which there is an hCARΔcyt
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to serve as an internal control (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        An important consideration at the outset of these
        studies concerned the possibility that ectopic hCAR
        expression or adenoviral transduction might affect the
        normal development and/or function of T cells. For this
        reason, we chose to use a truncated variant of hCAR to
        preclude possible signaling by this molecule [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . As
        evidenced by the functional data reported herein, and those
        from previous reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , there does not appear to
        be an adverse effect of either hCARΔcyt expression or
        adenoviral transduction on T cell activation, development
        or function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced proliferative responses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naïve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hCARΔcyt T</ENAMEX> cells were comparable to those of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-hCAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11.10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">littermates</ENAMEX>, and the differentiative
        potential of transduced naïve T cells into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX> or Th2
        effectors was not compromised. While at higher
        multiplicities of adenoviral infection (MOIs) than those
        required for efficient transduction there were deleterious
        effects on naïve T cell viability (data not shown), at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MOIs</ENAMEX> used we saw no decrease in cell viability or function.
        Further, adenoviral transduction of resting, naïve T cells
        exerted no detectable intrinsic activation of these cells,
        suggesting that adenoviral delivery of genes of interest to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-cycling T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> will permit loss or gain of function
        studies prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>- or mitogen-driven
        stimulation.
        Ad-transduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DO11</TIMEX>.hCARΔcyt trafficked normally to
        secondary lymphoid organs following adoptive transfer,
        indicating that neither hCARΔcyt nor adenoviral
        transduction altered normal in vivo migration patterns.
        This affords the opportunity to examine the in vivo
        responses of transduced, naïve or effector T cells
        following ex vivo gene transfer. Limitations in previous
        studies of in vivo adenoviral transduction have been the
        poor stability of adenoviral transduction in dividing cells
        and the induction of cytotoxic immune responses to
        adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX>. We observed no decrement in GFP
        expression by adoptively transferred cells as long as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> following transfer (data not shown), but have not yet
        examined <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wan et al.</ENAMEX> reported accelerated
        loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-transduced cells relative to controls via an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX>-mediated mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] suggesting limitations for
        long-term adoptive transfer studies into immune-competent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. It is unclear at present how immune responses
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-transduced T</ENAMEX> cells might affect their in vivo
        function, but the ability to examine early in vivo
        responses following adoptive transfers for even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-4 days
        should prove valuable, and transfers into immune-deficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> should facilitate long-term in vivo studies.
        Further, continued advances in the development of "gutless"
        adenoviral vectors that avoid expression of cytotoxic
        antigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> may alleviate immune clearance problems [

        Conclusions
        The hCARΔcyt.CD2 transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> reported here offer
        unique properties that will be advantageous for many T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> studies. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> offer several advantages
        over existing approaches for short-term gene delivery into
        primary T cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> of which is the capacity for
        high-efficiency transduction of T cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G0</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">G1</NUMEX> of cell
        cycle. The introduction of the hCARΔcyt.CD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> transgenic lines, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DO11.10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> reported
        here, will provide a powerful system for T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developmental</ENAMEX> studies. Due to their high immunogenicity and
        their extra-chromosomal replication, the current adenoviral
        vectors may not be appropriate for long-term transduction
        in-vivo but improvement in vector design and adoptive
        transfer into immunodeficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> may facilitate
        experiments in the future. The development of newer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> adenoviruses containing elements for
        epichromosomal replication may alleviate limitations that
        prevent more stable in vivo expression in dividing lymphoid
        cells derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hCAR</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
