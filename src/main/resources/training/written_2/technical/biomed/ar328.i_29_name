        The clinical observation that sexual dimorphism plays a
        role in the immune response suggests that the endocrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is an important factor for the development and
        maintenance of the response. There is a high frequency of
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and an increased immune
        response to antigenic stimulus. These observations make it
        evident that sexual dimorphism probably acts on the immune
        response through its effect upon the
        thymic-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hypothalamic-pituitary</NUMEX>-gonadic axis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        Series of subjects with gonadal dysgenesis, and isolated
        cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Klinefelter's syndrome</ENAMEX> associated with
        rheumatic/autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (RAD), suggest a relation
        between these clinical conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Among male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reported to date who have hypogonadism and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], scleroderma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>], rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], ankylosing spondylitis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>], and polymyositis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> has
        been associated with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thyroiditis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], juvenile
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (JRA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and juvenile-onset
        inflammatory bowel disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of these reports
        included eunuchoid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">abnormal X</ENAMEX> karyotype [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Our goal in the present work was to determine whether
        male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with untreated hypogonadism have an increased
        risk of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX>, and, if so, whether there is a
        relation to the type of hypogonadism.
      
      
        Methods
        The clinical criteria of male hypogonadism refers to
        failure of testicular function resulting in decreased
        production or absence of male sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and impaired
        spermatogenesis, whether this failure is secondary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic</ENAMEX> and pituitary dysfunction or is primary
        testicular failure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who fulfilled the previous hypogonadism
        criteria who were seen at the outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrology Clinic</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1998 to May 2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> who
        were not receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone substitution</ENAMEX> were selected for
        this study.
        The clinical criteria of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male 'hypogonadism</ENAMEX>' refers to
        failure of testicular function resulting in decreased
        production or absence of male sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and impaired
        spermatogenesis, whether this failure is secondary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic</ENAMEX> and pituitary dysfunction or is primary
        testicular failure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> normogonadic healthy male hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with
        similar age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] constituted the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for testicular size and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> levels.
        All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> gave their informed consent. They and
        the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were given a neuroendocrine, genetic,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> evaluation, including a physical exam, in
        addition to computed tomography of the sella turcica and
        karyotyping of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leukocytes</ENAMEX>. The presence of
        secondary sexual characteristics and testicular volume
        (normal value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>20 ml</NUMEX>) were noted.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the rheumatolgic evaluation included a
        search for the presence of diagnostic criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>,

        to determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Wintrobe

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        As far as we know, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of an
        intentional search for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with untreated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypogonadism</ENAMEX>.
        Usually, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with hypogonadism diagnosed in infancy or
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are those who have a complete hypogonadic clinical
        picture. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, however, exhibit an incomplete
        clinical picture and may reach adulthood without having
        their condition diagnosed. Their condition may come to
        light during tests of sterility in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple</TIMEX>, or during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>], which have
        established the frequency of male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypogonadism</ENAMEX>.
        At present, it is considered that the frequency of male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypogonadism in the general male population
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 0.04</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>] and that the
        most frequent genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alteration</ENAMEX> found in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> is
        that causing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Klinefelter's syndrome</ENAMEX>, whose prevalence is of
        the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.09%</NUMEX> in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.3%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with certain mental
        or behavioral problems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29</TIMEX>].
        Our study was performed in a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypogonadism to those that have been reported
        previously, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        studied in an andrology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> for infertility and thus are
        not an unselected sample of the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        their hypogonadism had not been diagnosed or treated
        previously. Although it is arguable that our series of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, not being a representative sample, is unsuitable
        for evaluation of the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        hypogonadism, we investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> only in those who had not
        been treated for their hypogonadism, to avoid the
        possibility that androgen replacement had interfered with
        the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>].
        Because the clinical picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was severe, with clear systemic and articular
        symptoms, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> had been diagnosed elsewhere. However,
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypogonadism</ENAMEX> who also had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>
        had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few articular</NUMEX> symptoms, so slight that the RAD
        had gone unnoticed until we looked for it.
        Considering that the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>,
        where our study was performed, is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.83%</NUMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.62%</NUMEX>; SLE <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.03%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymyositis</ENAMEX>/dermatomyositis <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.04%</NUMEX>; JRA
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.03%</NUMEX>; AS <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX>; and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjogren's syndrome</ENAMEX>, mix
        connective tissue disease, etc.], <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], the
        relatively large number of cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in this very small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with untreated hypogonadism was
        surprisingly high ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), suggesting a strong
        relation between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions (see Supplementary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> only in those patients
        with severe testicular dysfunction suggests that such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> is one endogenous factor that predisposes to
        the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX>.
        The disorder most frequent in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was the
        combination of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B27</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>. The frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        B27 (all of whom also developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>) was very high (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.7%</NUMEX>),
        leading to the conclusion that the risk that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypogonadism</ENAMEX> will develop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> is higher than that of a
        healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mestizo</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4%</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. We cannot explain
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> at present.
        The frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> in male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypogonadism
        was higher than would be expected in the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Despite the increased odds ratio for the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> in such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the confidence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> was very wide, suggesting that other factors in
        addition to hormonal and genetic alterations affect the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> includes, as far as we know, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case of hypogonadism associated with juvenile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermatomyositis</ENAMEX>. The development of dermatomyositis and JRA
        was higher in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>, respectively;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, the confidence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> was not calculable; therefore we conclude that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are coincidental. The fact that
        frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> was no higher in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than
        in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and
        hypogonadism are not related, as has already been suggested
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we studied was so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> (hypogonadism due to various causes, and
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX>), we can conclude only that the hypogonadism
        itself (regardless of its particular etiology) and the very
        low serum testosterone levels are associated with the
        increased frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX>.
        Studies in healthy, normogonadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> have
        found low serum levels of testosterone and high levels of E
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjogren's syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. The inflamed tissues of
        normogonadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> contain intense cellular
        infiltrates rich in macrophages. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have hormonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> capable of converting testosterone and
        androstenedione into estrone and E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> by means of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aromatase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38</TIMEX>].
        An increase in the activity of aromatase induced locally
        could explain the drop in androgen levels and the increase
        in estrogens observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. However,
        in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, serum testosterone and E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were both decreased. Therefore, in our
        hypogonadic male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the main cause of the
        testosterone decrease was not due to an increase in its
        conversion to E 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> because the gonadal failure caused a
        decrease of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, mainly of the testosterone,
        without showing an increment from its conversion to E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Although the effects of low serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testosterone</ENAMEX> levels on the immune system have been little
        studied, Bebo 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> have shown that orchidectomy
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can diminish the flow of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +activated in
        experimental autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encephalomyelitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
        before treatment with androgens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Klinefelter's syndrome</ENAMEX> but not RAD have very diminished
        levels of testosterone associated with high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX>,
        IgA, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgM</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> and with an absolute increase of
        CD3 +, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 +/CD8</ENAMEX> +ratio [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In patients
        who have both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Klinefelter's syndrome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX>, the
        diminished level of testosterone is associated with low
        percentages of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">OKT3</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">OKT8</NUMEX> +and with an increase of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">OKT4/OKT8</ENAMEX> ratio [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. On the basis of our findings and of
        the reports cited, we conclude that lack of testosterone
        increases humoral and cellular immunity. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">androgens</ENAMEX> are
        given, these abnormalities are reversed and the clinical
        picture improves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>].
        If our argument is correct, low serum testosterone
        levels favor the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAD</ENAMEX> in the hypogonadic male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, while in the normogonadic male who develops RAD
        (mainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) the decrease of testosterone serum levels is
        due to an increase in its metabolism for the activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system, with the subsequent elevation of E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . These differences could also explain
        the low or almost null <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and hypogonadism [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. In both cases, after androgens are given, the clinical
        picture and the abnormalities of the immune system are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ameliorated</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 38</TIMEX>].
        In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> who have hypogonadism, regardless of
        its cause, develop RAD more frequently than the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, when they have very low serum levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testosterone</ENAMEX>.
