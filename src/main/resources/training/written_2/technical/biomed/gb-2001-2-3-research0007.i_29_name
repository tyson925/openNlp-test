        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxoglutarate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2OG</NUMEX>)- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)-dependent dioxygenases
        are widespread in eukaryotes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and catalyze a
        variety of reactions typically involving the oxidation of
        an organic substrate using a dioxygen molecule [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-studied</ENAMEX> reaction catalyzed by such enzymes is the
        hydroxylation of proline and lysine sidechains in collagen
        and other animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycoproteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
        enzymes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> catalyze the formation of the plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone ethylene</ENAMEX> by oxidative desaturation of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate</TIMEX>, and catalyze the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylation</ENAMEX> and desaturation steps in the synthesis of
        other plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> and metabolites such as
        gibberellins, anthocyanidins and flavones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and fungi, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this family
        participate in the desaturative cyclization and oxidative
        ring expansion reactions in the biosynthesis of antibiotics
        such as penicillin and cephalosporin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. The
        details of the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes have
        been revealed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the crystal structures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isopenicillin N</ENAMEX> synthase (IPNS), deacetoxycephalosporin C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> (DAOCS) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clavaminic acid synthase</ENAMEX> (CAS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> showed that the catalytic core of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> consists of a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH)
        fold containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HX</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DE</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dyad</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> is any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>)
        and a conserved carboxy-terminal histidine which together
        chelate a single iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">atom</ENAMEX>. The substrates are bound within
        a spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cavity</ENAMEX> formed by the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSBH</ENAMEX> (see
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Structural Classification of Proteins</ENAMEX> (SCOP) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]).
        We use sequence profile analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>] to show that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-repair protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlkB</ENAMEX>, the extracellular matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein leprecan</ENAMEX> and the disease-resistance-related protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> define new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> is widely represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and has an important role in countering the
        toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> modifications caused by alkylating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in both
        
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Despite
        considerable effort, the precise biochemical mechanisms of
        its action in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair remain unknown. Recent studies
        have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> is required for specifically
        processing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> resulting from the alkylation of
        single-stranded (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ss</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Our findings predict an
        unusual role for this enzyme in oxidative detoxification of
        DNA damage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9 protein</ENAMEX> from 
        Caenorhabditis elegans is necessary
        for normal muscle function, and its inactivation results in
        strong resistance to paralysis induced by the 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        We predict that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> is a novel hydroxylase that could
        elicit its action through the modification of sidechains of
        intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Similarly, we show that the animal
        extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix protein leprecan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] defines a
        hitherto unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein hydroxylases</ENAMEX> that might
        be involved in the generation of substrates for protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX>.

          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamily</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and functional prediction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Non-redundant Protein Sequence Database</ENAMEX> (NCBI) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>] was searched using the PSI-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] run to
          convergence, with a profile-inclusion threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AlkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> from various organisms as
          queries. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> orthologs, these
          searches retrieved from the database, with statistically
          significant expectation (e) values, several other more
          distant homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX>, including uncharacterized
          eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and fragments of the polyproteins of
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caria-</ENAMEX>, tricho- and potexvirus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologs</ENAMEX> found include: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leishmania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L3377.4</ENAMEX>, iteration <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
          e-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -7</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG17807</ENAMEX>, iteration <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          e-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>; papaya <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mosaic</ENAMEX> virus, iteration <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          e-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>. Further iterations of the search
          using each of the detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as a new query
          resulted in the detection of several more eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> and leprecan, several
          uncharacterized bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and prolyl and lysyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylases</ENAMEX>. Finally, another iteration of database
          searches initiated with the sequences of bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, typified by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli YbiX</ENAMEX>, resulted in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unification</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> dioxygenases
          such as leucoanthocyanidin oxidase and gibberellin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidase</ENAMEX>. In this context, it should be noted that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-repair <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> typified by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli AlkB</ENAMEX> are unrelated to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alkane omega-hydroxylase</ENAMEX> typified by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. oleovorans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> also named
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX>. Fortuitously, these latter alkane hydroxylases are
          also oxygenases; however, they are not 2OG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
          dioxygenases but a distinct class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">di-iron enzymes</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]. On the basis of the results of database searches
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> sequences, we delineated several
          distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2OG</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dioxygenase</ENAMEX> fold
          and constructed individual alignments for each using the
          ClustalW program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was predicted
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PSI-PRED</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]
          programs. Using the secondary structure elements from the
          experimentally determined structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX> (PDB:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1ips</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAOCS</ENAMEX> (PDB:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1dcs</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> (PDB:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1drt</ENAMEX>) and the predicted
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the
          conserved core of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> was delineated (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A multiple alignment for the entire superfamily was
          constructed by aligning the conserved sequence features
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> by all the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The boundaries of
          the secondary structure elements in the alignment were
          adjusted using the secondary structure conservation as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>.
          The conserved portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase
          superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> comprises the core DSBH domain seen
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAOCS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>] and
          part of the amino-terminal α helix that showed
          considerable variability in both length and sequence
          between individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The DSBH
          region includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> conserved strands that are common
          to all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and are arranged in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sheets in a
          jelly-roll topology (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have specific inserts in various positions
          between the conserved strands; some of these inserts
          contain additional secondary structures and show
          significant sequence conservation (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For
          example, the insert between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> strand in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> is predicted to contain an extra strand, whereas in
          the small-molecule dioxygenase (IPNS/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene-</ENAMEX>forming
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> (EFE)) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the same region forms (or is
          predicted to form) a short helix (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          clavaminic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid synthase</ENAMEX>, an outlier of this latter
          family, has its own characteristic inserts, including a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 70</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) insert between
          strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlkB</ENAMEX> family
          have smaller inserts in the same position (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          This reflects the relative resilience of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSBH</ENAMEX> to
          insertions, and accounts for difficulties in unification
          of this superfamilyby sequence-based methods. The
          multiple alignment contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> characteristic
          conserved motifs that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, respectively, at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HXD</ENAMEX> dyad
          near the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX>, a histidine towards the carboxyl
          terminus, and an arginine or lysine further downstream
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HXD</ENAMEX> dyad is located in a flexible loop
          that follows the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> conserved strand and stacks with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the core strands (Figures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> conserved histidine is associated with
          the beginning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> strand, whereas the conserved
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>) is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the seventh</TIMEX>
          strand of the DSBH core (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
          position after the conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is invariably
          occupied by a bulky <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that is either arginine (in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX>) or phenylalanine or tryptophan in all other members
          of this fold [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The roles of all these conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in catalysis
          are apparent from the crystal structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX>,
          clavaminic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid synthase</ENAMEX> (CAS) and deacetoxycephalosporin
          C synthase (DAOCS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. The conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HXD</ENAMEX> and the
          carboxy-terminal histidine coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) that is
          directly involved in catalysis by these enzymes (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue interacts</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxylate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the acidic substrate, while the
          bulky or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aromatic residue</ENAMEX> located carboxy-terminal to the
          basic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> forms the base of the cleft that holds this
          substrate molecule (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Whereas most of these
          enzymes necessarily use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-OG as the acidic substrate,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX> does not bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-OG. Its place is occupied by its
          single substrate,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L-δ-(α-aminoadipoyl</ENAMEX>)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine, whose carboxyl
          sidechain interacts with the conserved basic residue
          similarly to the OG-carboxylate in the other enzymes of
          this superfamily [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
          The conservation of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> implicated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX> in the biochemically uncharacterized proteins
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlkB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX>, leprecan and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbiX</ENAMEX> suggests they all
          catalyze oxidative reactions similar to those catalyzed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAOCS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAS</ENAMEX> and related enzymes such as protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lysyl/prolyl</ENAMEX> hydroxylases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFE</ENAMEX> and leucoanthocyanidin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Using the available contextual
          information, we attempted to predict possible substrates
          of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. AlkB binds ssDNA and is required for
          the processing of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> modifications caused by SN2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alkylating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as methylmethanesulfonate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX>)
          specifically on ssDNA. On the basis of the preferential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificity of AlkB</ENAMEX>-dependent repair for ssDNA and for
          SN2 as opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN1</NUMEX> alkylating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, it has been
          proposed that its targets include modified bases such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-methyladenine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylcytosine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The
          predicted 2OG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> is
          probably involved in the detoxification of methylated
          bases in ssDNA, possibly through hydroxylation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, resulting in less toxic base derivatives.
          The hydroxylation might be followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oxidative
          step that could remove the hydroxymethyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, restoring
          the normal base in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. These reactions are consistent
          with the observation that, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkA, AlkB</ENAMEX> has no DNA
          glycosylase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The most intriguing finding
          made during our analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the
          existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple eukaryotic AlkB homologs</ENAMEX>, other
          than the actual orthologs, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>. The specific action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> on ssDNA suggests
          that ssRNA could be the substrate for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Given the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA methylases</ENAMEX> that
          could modify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in a similar way as the alkylating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> the function of the uncharacterized AlkB-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> could be to reverse such modifications. Such
          modifications might also be used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-mediated
          inactivation of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAs</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> homologs
          acquired by some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> viruses could counter this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-defense mechanism. The connection between nucleic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methylation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> described here is
          supported by the domain architecture of a conserved pair
          of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C14B1.10</NUMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG17807</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ) in which an
          amino-terminal AlkB-like domain is fused to a
          carboxy-terminal predicted methyltransferase domain.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> could potentially be involved in
          regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stability or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair via controlled

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGL-9</ENAMEX> defines a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2OG</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
          dioxygenase superfamily that is highly conserved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and is also represented in the pathogenic
          proteobacteria such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeruginosa</ENAMEX> and 
          Vibrio cholerae. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> is required for
          normal egg laying, whereas loss of its function provides
          resistance to hypercontractile muscular paralysis caused
          by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeruginosa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The
          vertebrate homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> is specifically expressed in
          smooth muscles and is likely to have a role in their
          function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. At its carboxyl terminus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGL-9</ENAMEX> contains
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYND</ENAMEX> finger domain that is probably involved in
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The closest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGL-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are the proline
          hydroxylases with which they share a region of specific
          extended conservation amino terminal to the core DSBH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This relationship, along with the
          combination to the intracellular MYND domain and the lack
          of signal peptides, suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-9</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are prolyl hydroxylases that modify
          intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, unlike the classic prolyl
          hydroxylases that have been implicated primarily in the
          modification of collagens in the endoplasmic lumen. The
          interesting aspect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGL-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is its presence in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeruginosa</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), which
          have apparently acquired these genes by horizontal
          transfer from eukaryotes. The direct connection between
          this gene acquisition and the action of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. aeruginosa toxins on animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscles</ENAMEX> is unclear, but it seems possible that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial EGL-9</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> modify host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a
          manner that favors the survival and spread of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX>. This might be especially pertinent if the host
          downregulates the endogenous ortholog in response to the
          infection.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leprecan</ENAMEX> is a proteoglycan that is associated with the
          basement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> in chordates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. It and related
          proteins contain an amino-terminal segment rich in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leucine</ENAMEX> and proline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and a carboxy-terminal globular
          part that includes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) oxygenase domain. More
          distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the leprecan-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> include
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T23K23.7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and a family of
          uncharacterized proteobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> typified by YbiX
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are predicted to be previously
          unnoticed amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid hydroxylases</ENAMEX> that catalyze
          modifications of intracellular and extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Evolutionary implications
          Sequence conservation is high within individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase superfamily, with
          specific extensions typical of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, but low
          between different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This observation,
          together with the phyletic distribution of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, provides some clues to their evolutionary
          history. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily could not be
          detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX> despite extensive profile
          searches of the archaeal proteomes as well as transitive
          searches seeded with many divergent sequences as starting
          points. This suggests that, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          eukaryotes, in which the superfamily is widely
          represented, archaea do not encode 
          bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. A corollary of
          this is that horizontal gene transfer between bacteria
          and eukaryotes might have had a significant role in the
          evolution of this superfamily. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSBH</ENAMEX> fold that
          comprises the core domain of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenases
          is also present in a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> typified by
          the arabinose-binding domain of the transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regulator AraC</ENAMEX>, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed proteins</ENAMEX> such as vicilin, and
          oxalate oxidase ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]; see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). Despite the lack
          of detectable sequence similarity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
          dioxygenases, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain a conserved HXH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> and a carboxy-terminal histidine that appear to be
          equivalent to the metal-chelating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HXD</ENAMEX> and
          carboxy-terminal histidine of the latter (see above).
          Thus, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamilies</ENAMEX> could have evolved
          from a common ancestor by acquiring distinct catalytic
          and ligand-binding properties. The classic AraC-like DSBH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> appear to have a more universal distribution
          than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenases, with diverse forms
          represented in archaea, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes. The
          2OG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase superfamily is present in diverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that had probably diverged before the
          diversification of the eukaryotes that contain this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>. This, together with the phyletic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributution of the AraC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenase
          superfamilies, leads us to speculate that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
          dioxygenase superfamily evolved from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AraC</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> through drastic sequence
          divergence that eliminated significant sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, followed by fixation of the modified
          active-site configuration.
          In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, a single horizontal
          transfer event probably resulted in their entry into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> lineage, which was followed by adaptation to
          new, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-related roles by some paralogs. In the case of
          the small-molecule dioxygenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS/EFE</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, a
          complex web of relationships can be discerned. The EFE
          and the plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis enzymes
          flavonol synthase, leucoanthocyanidin hydroxylase and
          giberellin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> oxidase show maximum diversify in the plant
          lineage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Their close homologs are, however,
          also found in 
          Pseudomonas, but not in other
          well-studied proteobacterial lineages. Similarly, fungi
          contain several enzymes involved in secondary metabolite
          biosynthesis, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPNS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAOCS</ENAMEX>, that are distinctly
          related to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in actinomycetes. This
          patchy phyletic distribution across kingdoms is
          suggestive of multiple gene transfer events that have
          apparently led to the wide dissemination of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes. The close grouping
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene-</ENAMEX>forming enzyme and its 
          Pseudomonas homologs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] to the
          exclusion of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in plants
          indicates a possible recent acquisition of the gene in 
          Pseudomonas from its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
          In 
          Arabidopsis there is an expansion
          of small-molecule dioxygenases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>),
          whereas 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeruginosa</ENAMEX> has at least three
          recently duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. This proliferation of the
          small-molecule dioxygenases is consistent with their
          possible role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites
          in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6, 7, 30</ENAMEX>]. The amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylases</ENAMEX> show the greatest diversify in eukaryotes,
          and are represented in a number of different forms in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. They were probably derived from
          small-molecule hydroxylases early in eukaryotic
          evolution. In contrast, the predicted amino-acid
          hydroxylases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGL-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are seen sporadically,
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> copies, in certain bacterial lineages such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>. aeruginosa, suggesting a
          secondary horizontal transfer from the eukaryotes to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Before this study, structure determination, biochemical
        studies and sequence comparisons of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2OG</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dioxygenases
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 9</ENAMEX>] had elucidated their structural fold, active-site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and reaction mechanism. Here, using sequence
        profile searches, we show that many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> families
        contain the same constellation of active-site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and
        are predicted to adopt the same fold. This allows us to
        predict the catalytic activity of a wide range of
        functionally important, but biochemically uncharacterized,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from eukaryotes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In particular, we
        propose a specific mechanism of action in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair, and
        possibly in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> modification, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Non-redundant Protein Sequence Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expressed Sequence Tags Database</ENAMEX> (NCBI) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] and the
        individual protein sequence databases of completely and
        partially sequenced genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] were searched using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gapped</ENAMEX> version of the BLAST programs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTPGP</ENAMEX> for proteins
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTNGP</ENAMEX> for translating searches of nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Sequence profile searches were performed
        using the PSI-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]; profiles were saved
        using the -C option and retrieved using the -<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> option.
        Multiple alignments of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> were generated
        using a combination of PSI-BLAST, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] and
        secondary structure predictions that were produced using
        the PHD program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and the PSI-PRED program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], with
        multiple alignments of individual protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> used as
        queries. The three-dimensional structure visualization,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> and modeling were carried out using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SWISS-PDB-Viewer</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
