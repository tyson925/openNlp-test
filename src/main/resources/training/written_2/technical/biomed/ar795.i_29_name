        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> has been implicated as a pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in
        numerous inflammatory and degenerative conditions,
        including rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) and osteoarthritis (OA)
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> receptor antagonist (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>), a naturally
        occurring inhibitor of the biologic actions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>, has
        obvious therapeutic potential in such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ;
        indeed recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> (anakinra) has recently
        been approved for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> as the drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kineretâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Oaks</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        Limitations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> as a pharmaceutical include its
        lack of oral availability and its short biologic half-life.
        This is why in clinical application <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kineretâ„¢</ENAMEX> must be
        administered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous</ENAMEX> injection. Even then, it
        remains unlikely that a therapeutic concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        will be maintained between injections [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> is
        rapidly eliminated in the kidney, resulting in a serum
        half-life of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-6 hours</TIMEX> following intravenous injection into
        healthy, human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. This problem is exacerbated by
        the pronounced spare receptor effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>. According to
        the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] it is necessary to maintain an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> molar ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> or more to achieve a
        strong inhibitory effect.
        We have proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra gene transfer as a means of
        overcoming these problems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        gene delivery include its ability to engender the
        continuous production of therapeutic concentrations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> at defined anatomic locations for extended periods
        of time - potentially for life. Moreover, it is
        theoretically possible to regulate levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene
        expression in a manner commensurate with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene therapy has been evaluated in a number of
        different animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>, with extremely
        promising results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Indeed, a phase I human study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] was recently successfully completed.
        During the preclinical development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene
        therapy, we often noticed that transfer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene
        provided a far greater biologic effect than administration
        of the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. An example is provided by the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in rabbits.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewthwaite</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] reported that repeated
        injection of recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> had no effect in this
        model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> beyond inhibition of the synovial fibrosis
        occurring in the chronic stage of the disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Otani</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , in contrast, observed a dramatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage matrix metabolism</ENAMEX>, and a
        moderate anti-inflammatory effect when administering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        locally to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> via 
        ex vivo gene transfer.
        There exist several possible explanations for the
        improved effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> when delivered as a gene
        rather than as a recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The most likely of
        these are as follows. First, gene transfer results in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuous</ENAMEX>, rather than intermittent, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> delivery,
        thus maintaining a constant supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> at a
        concentration sufficient to inhibit the biologic actions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, gene delivery produces a molecule that has
        been subjected to authentic post-translational processing.
        Because the recombinant molecule lacks glycosylation and
        has an extra amino-terminal methionine, the native molecule
        may have greater biologic potency than the recombinant
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
        The present study was designed to compare quantitatively
        the relative effectiveness of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> of protein
        delivery under controlled conditions 
        in vitro . Cultures of primary human
        synovial fibroblasts (HSFs) were treated with human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>,
        either administered as the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-culture with fibroblasts genetically engineered to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> and secrete human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> in a constitutive manner.
        Stimulation from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> was then provided by addition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant IL-1Î² protein</ENAMEX> or by co-culture with
        fibroblasts genetically engineered to constitutively
        secrete high levels of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostaglandin E</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) levels in conditioned media as a
        readout of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation in the respective cultures,
        protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation by each method was
        evaluated under static and dynamic culture conditions, the
        latter of which were designed to resemble more closely the
        circumstance of an arthritic joint in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> is
        chronically produced.
        The data suggest that the recombinant and transgenic
        molecules are similarly potent. Although the gene delivery
        procedure may benefit marginally from increased
        concentration at the cellular level, the advantage of gene
        transfer as a means of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> delivery arises from the
        sustained availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> that this method
        permits.

          Reporter cell cultures
          Human synovial tissues were recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing total joint replacement surgery.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> were isolated by sequential digestion of synovial

          Engineered cell lines
          To generate a cell line that provided a source of
          constitutive production and secretion of transgenic

          allowed positive selection of the transduced cells in
          medium containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Zeocin</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml. These cells,

          minced with a scalpel, and digested for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at 37Â°C
          under gentle agitation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> clostridial collagenase.
          Dermal cells were recovered by centrifugation of the
          digestion mixture at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> rpm in a table top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centrifuge</ENAMEX>,
          and then cultured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 cm 2flasks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> FBS
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> penicillin-streptomycin. Adherent cells were
          transduced with an amphotropic retrovirus,
          DFG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î²</NUMEX>-neo, which encodes the mature form of human

        Results
        To quantitatively compare the ability of recombinant

        (i.e. transgenic [t]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>) to inhibit the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, we performed a series of experiments using both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">static</ENAMEX> and dynamic conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation. Because
        the synovium is an important contributor to pathogenesis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, primary cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> were used as target
        cells, and concentrations of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in media conditioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> were
        used as a measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation.
        In our initial experiments we compared the inhibitory
        activity of rIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ra</NUMEX> to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIG-82-IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> +cells - a
        cell line engineered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX> express human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra

        the recombinant and transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> were
        similarly capable of blocking the effects of the added
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. For each source of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î² inhibition</ENAMEX> was
        extrapolated to a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> and complete inhibition at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml.
        This translated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> ratios of approximately
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">46 : 1 and 160 : 1</TIMEX>, respectively. In control experiments,
        levels of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> challenge of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> with nontransduced HIG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> cells were
        found to be identical to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> alone (data not
        shown).
        Relative to the end-point concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>,
        there was no apparent difference in the effectiveness of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. By adding the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the
        modified cells at the same time as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, the concentration
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> would be at its maximum at the time of initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation. That of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tIL-1Ra</TIMEX>, however, would be
        essentially <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and would not reach its maximal
        concentration until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours later</TIMEX>, at the time of media
        harvest. Using this rationale, we compared the
        effectiveness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra and tIL-1Ra</TIMEX> under conditions in
        which the concentration of each would be similar at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation. To allow sufficient time for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to adhere and begin transgenic
        expression, we performed experiments similar to that above,
        but added the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î²</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after addition of the range of
        doses of rIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ra</NUMEX> or tIL-1Ra producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to the HSF
        cultures. The conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were analyzed at the time
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> addition and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours later</TIMEX> for PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> content. A plot of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> concentrations versus PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulated</ENAMEX> controls is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. To illustrate the
        change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> concentration over time in the wells
        receiving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, we plotted the final
        PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        concentration at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation and at the
        end of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hour</TIMEX> incubation. Because these values
        represent the starting and end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> concentrations,
        the effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tIL-1Ra</TIMEX> dose should lie somewhere between and
        is represented by the shaded area between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX>.
        As might be expected of a competitive inhibitor,
        preincubation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSF with IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation significantly reduced the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> inhibition
        level for each source of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>. For the recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î² inhibition</ENAMEX> was extrapolated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>, and for the tIL-1Ra <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> inhibition fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 10</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml. For complete inhibition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 950</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml rIL-Ra</ENAMEX> was required, whereas for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the tIL-1Ra</TIMEX> between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 and 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml was necessary.
        The previous experiments provided evidence that the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">molecules rIL-1Ra</ENAMEX> and tIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ra</NUMEX> were functionally similar and
        equally capable of blocking the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. They also
        suggested that time was a factor critical to comparing the
        effectiveness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> constitutively produced
        by genetically modified cells. Thus, in several additional
        experiments we monitored the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hour</TIMEX> interval. For
        these experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> doses of rIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ra</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIG-82-IL-</ENAMEX>1Ra
        +cells were used, which from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2provided either low
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10-15%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25-50%</NUMEX>), or
        high level (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70-80%</NUMEX>) inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. HSFs
        were cultured in the presence of the various doses of cells
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 hours later</TIMEX> by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ng
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> intervals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were measured in the conditioned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, under these static culture
        conditions there was little meaningful change in the levels
        of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production over time. At the low and
        medium doses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> had little protective effect but,
        relative to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> time point, a significant increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation was seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> receiving the
        high dose by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 4</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> receiving the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIG-82-IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> +cells, protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation was
        maintained over time. Although the mean levels of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were reduced over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4 days</TIMEX> of the
        experiment, this was not statistically significant. Thus,
        under these conditions there were no dramatic differences
        between a single dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra and the tIL-1Ra</TIMEX> producing
        cells.
        It has been shown 
        in vivo that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> injected into the
        joint space can be cleared from the synovial fluid in as
        little as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, suggesting a steady egress of solutes
        from the joint. Thus, to compare the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tIL-1Ra</ENAMEX> producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> under more dynamic conditions,
        perhaps closer to those that might be encountered in the
        joint 
        in vivo , experiments were performed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identically</ENAMEX> to that described for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3except</ENAMEX> that one half
        of the culture media was replaced every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Analysis of media recovered at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> showed that
        the medium and low doses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> provided a marginal
        level of protection over time, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> receiving the
        highest dose initially high levels of protection were
        steadily lost (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). In stark contrast, the HSFs
        incubated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> producing cells exhibited a sharp
        reduction in PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production throughout the course of
        the experiment. For these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSF</ENAMEX> cultures receiving
        even the lowest dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIG-82-IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> +cells showed
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70%</NUMEX> inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX>.
        The previous experiment was intended to evaluate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">effects of IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> under dynamic conditions following a
        single stimulus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. To establish a situation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chronic IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> stimulation as might be encountered in an
        arthritic joint, experiments were designed like that
        described for Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, but in this case the source of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> was provided by the addition of dermal fibroblasts
        genetically modified to constitutively secrete mature human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, using these conditions the
        single dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> was unable to block the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">persistent IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> production. Even at the highest dose, the
        steady dilution of rIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ra</NUMEX> in the presence of constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> synthesis rapidly lost its protective effects. In
        this milieu, however, the potency of gene transfer as a
        method of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> delivery was perhaps most effectively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX>. The maintenance of and gradual increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> concentration provided by ongoing synthesis by the
        genetically modified cells at all doses provided sustained
        and increased protection from chronic synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>
        over time.
      
      
        Discussion
        For the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, gene therapy has the
        theoretical advantage over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> therapy of sustained
        delivery of the therapeutic product to a discrete site.
        Although its feasibility and effectiveness in animal models
        are now well established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 16 17 18 19 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] ,
        no direct study of the intrinsic merits of using
        genetically modified cells as a mechanism for protein
        delivery has been reported. We postulated several potential
        benefits that could arise, including natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
        processing and intercellular presentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        product. Indeed, it is known that anakinra, the recombinant
        form of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>, differs from its naturally occurring
        counterpart by possessing an additional amino-terminal
        methionine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> and lacking glycosylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the present study similar end-point
        levels of transgenic and recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> were necessary
        to inhibit fully the response of synoviocytes to a single
        challenge with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, and in agreement with
        earlier literature on this subject [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 27</NUMEX> ] , both forms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> required a molar excess over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        orders of magnitude to exercise an inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>.
        Altogether, these data suggest that the biochemical
        alterations of the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> do not significantly
        affect its ability to antagonize the responses of synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL</ENAMEX>-1Î².
        From the data presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, however, a modest
        increase in the effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tIL-1Ra</ENAMEX> is suggested when
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> considers the relative concentrations of recombinant
        and transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> with time. In experiments in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> was added at the same time as the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>,
        similar end-point concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> were found to
        provide corresponding inhibitory effects, despite the fact
        that the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was at its maximal
        concentration at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation whereas that
        from the modified cells was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. In other experiments in
        which, prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation, time was allowed for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to establish concentrations
        equivalent to that of the recombinant, the inhibitory curve
        was shifted slightly to the left, indicating a slight
        increase in the effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> when provided as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene product</ENAMEX>. This may arise from increased
        concentrations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene product in the cellular
        microenvironment where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is locally synthesized
        and secreted.
        Interestingly, following extended culture under static
        conditions, largely unremarkable differences in activity
        were observed between the constitutively produced tIL-1Ra
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX>. Significant differences between the two
        methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> delivery were only found under dynamic
        conditions in which the concentration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> was
        reduced with time. In these situations, such as that
        reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>, the importance of maintaining the
        local level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> became dramatically apparent, as were
        the advantages of gene transfer as a means of protein
        delivery. In the face of continual dilution, the
        constitutive production of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene product was able
        to maintain effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels and was able to
        sustain and increase protection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        stimulation as time progressed. This was even more
        pronounced under conditions of continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> production,
        in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rIL-1Ra</TIMEX> was readily overwhelmed. It should be
        noted that all of the experiments performed in this study
        used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSFs</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. It remains possible
        that the amplitude of the responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> may
        vary somewhat between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSFs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, and nondiseased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>; however, the overall result will probably
        remain the same.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rodent</TIMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, maximum therapeutic effects are
        only achieved when pumps are used to maintain a constant
        supply of large amounts of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>. Under these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">conditions IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> has both antierosive and
        anti-inflammatory effects in collagen-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. As
        discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bendele</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , constant serum
        concentrations of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> are
        antierosive, but it is necessary to achieve serum
        concentrations of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra/</ENAMEX>ml before
        important anti-inflammatory effects are seen. A single,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mg recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> achieves a peak plasma concentration of only about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.6 Î¼g IL-1Ra/</ENAMEX>ml, and concentrations superior or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g IL-1Ra/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> exist only for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 14 hours</TIMEX>. Local,
        intra-articular gene delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> could produce
        enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, with only a single injection of vector, to
        trigger both antierosive and anti-inflammatory local
        effects. This is of real interest because the clinical
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kineret</ENAMEX> is modest and might be explained by
        these circumstances. Moreover, its antierosive effect is
        more pronounced than the anti-inflammatory one probably
        because of the low local concentrations.
        As suggested by our results, maintaining higher 
        in vivo concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> in a
        sustained manner may be key to realizing the full
        therapeutic potential of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>. Gene delivery may
        offer the greatest chance of early success. Recent data
        from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> have shown that the synovial lining is
        capable of maintaining therapeutic levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 6 months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , providing
        increased optimism for the use of gene transfer in the
        treatment of chronic articular disease. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene
        therapy has demonstrated impressive efficacy in animal
        models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>, and a phase I human trial has recently
        confirmed that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> can be safely
        transferred to and expressed within human rheumatoid joints
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . A planned phase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study will determine the
        efficacy of this procedure.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> synthesized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenically</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells are equipotent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>. Our data indicate that the
        greater efficiency noted for transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> in previous
        animal gene therapy investigations reflects the ability of
        gene delivery to maintain higher 
        in vivo concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> in a
        sustained manner. This property was particularly striking
        under experimental conditions that resemble those found
        during chronic inflammatory conditions, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> is
        produced continually and the concentration of rIL-1Ra
        administered as a single bolus progressively falls. These
        findings are relevant to the clinical use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kineret</ENAMEX> and
        the possible future use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> gene therapy to treat
        joint diseases.
