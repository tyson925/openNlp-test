        In order to foster genetic studies there has been
        increased emphasis on the development of appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> to describe cognitive functions such as
        attention (see, for example, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). In general these
        efforts have used tasks that do not distinguish between
        different functions of attention. However, imaging studies
        have revealed quite specific anatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> for
        functions of attention such as orienting to sensory events,
        developing and maintaining the alert state and executive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> used in resolving conflict between stimuli and
        responses (for a review of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ). We
        seek to use this anatomical information to define
        appropriate endophenotypes for genetic studies of
        attention.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging</ENAMEX> studies show that the alerting network depends
        largely on frontal and parietal areas of the right
        hemisphere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> has important
        involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior</ENAMEX> and inferior parts of the parietal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lobe</ENAMEX> in conjunction with frontal and subcortical structures
        related to eye movements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> control
        network involves frontal areas including the anterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cingulate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral prefrontal cortex</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is also differentially dependent on
        a particular neuromodulator. Studies of alert monkeys
        suggest that the effectiveness of alerting produced by a
        warning signal can be eliminated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that block
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noradrenaline</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesions</ENAMEX> of the cholinergic system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        ] and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACh</ENAMEX> transmission have effects on
        orienting of visual attention in monkeys [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The
        executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> involves dopamine rich areas of the
        prefrontal cortex and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior cingulate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lesions</ENAMEX> in the
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of dopamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DA</ENAMEX>) neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] as well as in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> located in prefrontal cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] result in
        cognitive deficits in executive function tasks.
        There is considerable evidence that insults to parts of
        the brain containing these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> or to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuromodulators</ENAMEX> involved can produce specific neurological
        or psychiatric deficits. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> to the
        posterior parietal lobe involved in orienting produce
        neglect of the contralesional space and specific deficits
        in tasks involved the orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Reductions
        in striatal dopamine seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> result in
        an inability to shift sets from one instruction to another,
        possibly reflecting a difficulty in control of conflict [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Many psychiatric disorders whose anatomical origins
        may not be well understood also show deficits in attention.
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> exhibit
        difficulties in sensorimotor gating [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , smooth pursuit
        eye-tracking [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , set-shifting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , and working
        memory tasks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with
        attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit
        abnormal performance in sustained attention tasks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        and studies on autism reveal slowed covert orienting of
        visual spatial attention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>
        disease show covert orienting deficits in visual attention
        tasks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, many of these disorders show
        familial patterns of inheritance and increased concordance
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monozygotic</TIMEX> (MZ) vs. dizygotic (DZ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> suggesting
        genetic origins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        There is evidence that some kinds of variation in
        attention in normal subject and patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        involves genetic variation. Studies using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continuous</ENAMEX>
        Performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Task</ENAMEX> (CPT) have shown that the 
        d' signal detection component of CPT
        performance has a heritability among normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of
        0.49 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Span of Apprehension task</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPAN</ENAMEX>), a
        visual search task, has been shown to have an heritability
        among normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of 0.65 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P/N</ENAMEX> ratio of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spontaneous Selective Attention Task</ENAMEX> (SSAT) was shown
        to have an heritability among normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of 0.41 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] . Twin studies using discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> affected with
        schizophrenia show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spatial</ENAMEX> working memory, divided
        attention, choice reaction time and selective attention [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] and attentional set-shifting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] are underlain by
        inherited factors. Studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> suggest that
        effortful control and duration of orienting are heritable
        as well [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Recent studies have proceeded to associate genetic
        variation with performance variation in attentional
        function. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> homozygous for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Îµ4</NUMEX> allele
        
        apoe gene, who are asymptomatic, but
        at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> have been shown to have a
        specific deficit in orienting of attention that is in the
        same direction as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Other
        studies using endophenotypic measures of attention have
        linked variation in the 
        chrna7 gene with sensorimotor gating
        performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and variation in the 
        drd4 gene with attention deficits [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . However, the tasks used in these studies have not
        generally involved either the orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> alone, or
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task</ENAMEX> involves an undefined combination of different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        In previous work we have provided an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attention Network</ENAMEX>
        Test (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>) for measuring the efficiency of the alerting,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orienting</ENAMEX> and conflict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The advantage of
        this measure over other neuropsychological measures of
        attention is that it provides a rapid measure of the
        efficiency of each of the attention networks which have
        been linked to a specific anatomy and specific chemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulators</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> task is a combination of the cued
        reaction time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flanker</ENAMEX> task [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Its
        simple design permits use with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, non-human
        primates, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with various abnormalities of
        attention. Our previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and other studies
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flanker</ENAMEX> task suggest that performance on this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX> follows a roughly normal distribution. Performance is
        also stable within normal adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> across a wide age
        range and not detectably different in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. It
        has also been shown that practice or previous experience
        has little impact on the attentional measures although the
        overall reaction time is reduced. In this small scale
        preliminary study we take a step toward the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>
        as an endophenotype in genetic studies by exploring the
        heritability of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> studied by the
        test.
      
      
        Results
        The mean efficiency scores for each of the three
        attention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were calculated according to the
        operational definitions described below (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        Methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> means and standard deviations (SD)
        for each of the attention networks and overall reaction
        times (RT) separately for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>.
        The values obtained for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> attentional networks
        were similar to those found previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . To
        determine if these values or the overall RT differed
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a twin pair or between twin type (MZ or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX>), we carried out a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> effects and mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã 2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã 2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX>) analysis of variance
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) with twin type as between subject factor. There
        were no significant differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>,
        [F(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 50</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.74</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSe</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">912.98</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>], and twin type
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX>), [F (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 50</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.79</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSe</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3553.27</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>].
        The study consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sessions which permitted
        analysis of reliability in the present sample. The
        test-retest reliability for alerting, orienting, and
        conflict were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.36</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.81</NUMEX> respectively. They were
        significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .01</NUMEX>). Since the means of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> test
        sessions were used, the expected reliability composite of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.53</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.58</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.90</NUMEX> for alerting,
        orienting, and conflict respectively.
        The alerting, orienting, and conflict scores may be
        influenced directly or indirectly by the overall mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>.
        Generally one expects larger subtractions when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> are
        longer. In order to reduce these effects, ratio scores
        (effect divided by overall RT) were used in the correlation
        analysis and the estimations of the heritability of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the correlation values between
        twin pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritability</ENAMEX> is generally thought to be the proportion
        of variance that can be attributed to genetic rather than
        strictly environmental factors. Most often it is estimated
        by comparing monozygotic and dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Although there remains controversy in how purely genetic
        these calculation are [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and the best way compute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritability</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] we chose to calculate heritability in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, using the classical approach, the
        proportion of variance attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> genetic
        factors (narrow sense heritability) was estimated by
        doubling the difference in correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> and DZ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX>. This approach provides a simple and reliable index
        for twin studies which vary across time and culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        . This method however, is ineffective at disentangling
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> genetic factors and epistatic components as
        well and unique and shared environmental components. Table
        3shows the efficiency of the conflict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is heritable
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> 
        
          F 
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.62</NUMEX>) while low heritabilities were observed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alerting</ENAMEX> and median reaction time ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> 
        
          F 
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16</NUMEX> respectively, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.24</NUMEX> respectively). The orienting response
        shows no evidence of heritability. The orienting response
        shows a higher correlation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> than MZ twins
        In addition to the classical estimation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, we applied the structural
        equation modeling package <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mx</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] which allows the
        explicit representation of observed and latent variables.
        The advantage of this method lies in the ability to best
        fit the observed data according to path models that
        hypothesize varying degrees of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> and non-additive
        contributions as well as shared and unique environmental
        contributions. We chose a conservative approach, setting,
        the expected genetic correlation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and
        used the standard twin analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritability</ENAMEX> estimates for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> attentional networks and
        mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence limits). The contributions to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive genetic variance</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), common environmental variance (
        
        c <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and unique environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> ( 
        e <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) values are given. Interestingly,
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2s</ENAMEX> were in agreement with those
        calculated using the classical approach. The effect of
        conflict was highly heritable ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>) while low heritabilities
        were observed for alerting and reaction time and ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16</NUMEX> respectively).
      
      
        Discussion
        Because of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ns</ENAMEX> involved in this study, only the
        effect of conflict is significantly different than 0 and
        this is due to the very small correlation found in the DZ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX>. The correlation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> in conflict is
        suspiciously low because it is a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> than for
        any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> this, of course, would inflate
        the overall heritability of the conflict network. To
        compare the heritability of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> would take
        a much larger study. For example, a power calculation
        suggests that with the current size of the effect it would
        take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 600</NUMEX> pairs to reach significance for the
        alerting network.
        Nonetheless there is some indication favoring the
        heritability of the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. The heritability of
        the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> has been observed in other conflict
        tasks such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroop</ENAMEX> color-word task [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] which also
        activates the cingulate and other frontal areas [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flanker</ENAMEX> task has an advantage over the Stroop
        in that it does not involve language and our results show
        considerably higher heritability.
        The heritability of reaction time has also been observed
        in other twin studies on normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> studies where cognitive assays for executive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> or general intelligence depend on reaction time
        measures, the heritability of lower levels of processing
        involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> may thus influence the performance scores.
        To avoid this we normalized all efficiency scores as a
        function of median <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>.
        There have been no reported twin studies on the alerting
        response 
        per se , but this function, namely
        the maintenance of the alert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is inherently a part of
        many neuropsychological tasks. Interestingly, studies on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and mood have shown deficits in simple reaction
        time tasks in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that report sadness or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . These RT deficits are specific to left visual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> (right hemisphere) and are consistent with the right
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frontal</ENAMEX> and parietal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> involved in alerting. Changes
        in the efficiency of the alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> as a consequence
        of mood and depression are further supported by the
        findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liotti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] where subjects induced
        into sadness showed no improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> when given
        alerting cues before target stimuli were presented. The
        mean probandwise MZ concordance rate for unipolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depression</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) is more than twice that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] as well as for narrowly defined <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] suggesting the presence of genetic determinants.
        In our study there is no evidence of heritability for
        the orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. This may be because of low power of
        this small study. There is evidence that genes can
        influence orienting in a task similar to ours. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alzheimer</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disease</ENAMEX> is a heritable condition with a well described
        visual orienting deficit and where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> have been
        found in unaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> between visual orienting and
        the 
        apoe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In order to keep
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> simple the peripheral orienting cues are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
        valid. This differs from similar tasks of visual orienting
        where usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 80%</NUMEX> of the orienting cues are valid. In
        the visual orienting studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenwood</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with
        the 
        apoe gene was observed only when this
        validity manipulation was utilized. It is possible that the
        use of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> validity and the lack of any specific
        instruction may have made use of the cues a matter of
        individual strategy and thus both relatively unreliable and
        less subject to genetic influences. Future genetic studies
        may be more fruitful when the validity manipulation is
        included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX>.
        While it is likely that our failure to find any evidence
        of heritability of the orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is due to either
        the small scale of our study or weaknesses in our assay, it
        is certainly possible that low correlations among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>
        reflects differential experiences that these twin pairs
        undergo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
        The advantage of using an endophenotypic measure can be
        extended when information about the neuroanatomy physiology
        and development underlying performance on the task is
        available. Knowledge of brain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> involved in
        performance will serve to constrain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene identity
        and function and thus facilitate the integration of genetic
        information. In the case of the executive attention
        network, multiple imaging studies have shown activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> frontal areas. These areas are strongly
        modulated by dopamine and suggest the importance of
        examining genes that modulate dopamine. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these genes
        the dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D4 receptor gene</ENAMEX> has been repeatedly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attentional disorders</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>). While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele of this gene (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> repeat) has
        been found not to be associated with abnormalities in
        interference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroop</ENAMEX> effect, it is reasonable to
        examine other variants of this gene and other genes related
        to the dopamine system.
        Studies of human development have shown that the
        executive attention network is related to effortful control
        as measured from caregiver reports of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s
        behavior [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . Effortful control has also been shown to
        be heritable in twin studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] using larger numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and has been linked by behavioral studies to the
        ability to delay gratification, development of conscience
        and other aspects of self regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have developed phenotypic measures for the three
        aspects of attention: alerting, orienting and executive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> that have been the best described anatomically. Our
        small scale preliminary study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> suggests that at
        least the dopamine rich executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is appropriate
        for use in molecular genetic studies.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Subjects
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty six</NUMEX> MZ twin pairs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> DZ same sex pairs
          participated in the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twins</ENAMEX> were recruited in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vicinity of Peking University</ENAMEX> via newspaper
          advertisement. Paid volunteer pairs traveled to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of Psychology to undergo a pre-test interview
          by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident psychologist</ENAMEX>. Subjects with a history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">psychopathology</ENAMEX> and/or taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> were excluded. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> twin pairs interviewed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52 aged</TIMEX> matched pairs
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from ages 14-42 years old</TIMEX> met inclusion criteria. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reported normal or corrected to normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX>. Zygosity status was determined by close
          inspection of physical features, birth records, parental
          interview and genotyping of buccal swab <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          polymorphic genetic loci: 
          maoa, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">drd3</TIMEX>, dbh, maoa, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b1adr</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gsalpha</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51 52 53</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Procedure
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> was performed as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> viewed the stimuli and responses
          were collected via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> response buttons. Stimuli
          consisted of a row of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> visually presented horizontal
          black lines, with arrowheads pointing leftward or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rightward</ENAMEX>, against a gray background where the target was
          a leftward or rightward arrowhead at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. This
          target was flanked on either side by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrows in the
          same direction (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congruent condition</ENAMEX>), or in the opposite
          direction (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">incongruent condition</ENAMEX>), or by lines (neutral
          condition).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' task was to identify the direction
          of the centrally presented arrow by pressing one button
          for the left direction and a second button for the right
          direction. Cues consisted of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> msec asterisk
          presented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> msec before the target. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cue
          conditions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) no-cue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were shown a cross
          which was the same as the first fixation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 ms</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          central-cue, which was at the central fixation point; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
          double-cue, in which cues were presented on the two
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> locations simultaneously (both above and
          below the fixation point); and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) spatial-cue, cue was
          presented right on the target location (either above,
          below the central fixation point).
          A session consisted of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-trial practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experimental blocks of trials. Each experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> trials (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> conditions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> warning
          levels x <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 target</TIMEX> locations x <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX> target directions x 3
          congruency conditions, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> repetitions). The
          presentation of trials was in a random order.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were instructed to focus on a centrally
          located fixation cross throughout the task, and to
          response as fast, also as accurately as possible. Twin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair participants</ENAMEX> performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sessions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>
          allowing a break in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between sessions</TIMEX> while the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> performed the task.
        
        
          Calculation of attention network
          efficiencies
          Values for attention network efficiency were
          calculated from the raw reaction time data as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Medians were calculated for each test
          conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> conditions in total: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> cue levels by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          target levels, combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> locations and target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>) to avoid the influence of the outliers. The
          alerting effect was calculated by subtracting the mean RT
          of the conditions with double cue from the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the
          conditions with no cue. Since neither of these conditions
          provides information on the spatial location of the
          target, the subtraction gives a pure measure of alerting.
          The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the
          mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the conditions with spatial cue from the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the conditions with center cue. In both conditions
          the subject is alert but only the spatial cue provided
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> information on where to orient. The conflict
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>) effect was calculated by subtracting the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of congruent conditions from the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of
          incongruent conditions.
