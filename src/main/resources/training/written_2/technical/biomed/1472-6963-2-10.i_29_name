          Competition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>: a case
          study
          The implementation of selective contracting in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> offers a unique natural experiment to
          study the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to changes in the nature
          of competition. Unlike other health care markets, in
          which the change from quality to price based competition
          was gradual, driven by continuously increasing
          penetration of managed care, and often time confounded by
          other secular trends, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> legislation changed
          market conditions very rapidly for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in the
          state by permitting all health plans for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
          to contract with only a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. It thus
          allows a pre/post study design: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> resource
          allocation decisions during the quality competition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regime</ENAMEX> (pre period) can be compared to decisions made
          during the price competition regime (post period). This
          natural experiment allows us to test the hypothesis that
          changes in the nature of competition are more likely to
          be associated with a shift of resources from clinical to
          hotel activities (and a concomitant deterioration in
          mortality outcomes) in more competitive hospital markets.
          As the level of hospital competition has not changed
          during the period (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herfindahl</ENAMEX>-Hirschman Index (HHI)
          remained stable in all markets), this test is limited to
          the change in the 
          nature of competition and is not
          confounded by the impact of changes in the level of
          competition on resource allocation decisions.
          During the same time period, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were
          also subject for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time to price regulation, due
          to implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare PPS</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> also
          provided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with incentives to lower their costs,
          it did so in a distinctively different manner than price
          competition. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> set the price per discharge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were paid, thus creating incentives to lower
          costs, irrespective of market structure (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>). The
          intensity of price based competition, on the other hand,
          is highly sensitive to the competitiveness of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> market. The analytical strategy of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is
          based on this distinction.
        
        
          Hospital competition, quality, resource allocation
          and health outcomes
          Competition focused on prices, as is often the case in
          markets dominated by managed care, creates incentives to
          increase efficiency and possibly curtail resource use.
          With the exception of possible increases in
          administrative activities designed to contain costs in
          other areas (e.g. billing and utilization review) or to
          increase marketing efforts, such incentives to cut costs
          are likely to affect all aspects of hospital
          activities.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Hospitals</ENAMEX> may also compete on quality, both quality of
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> and quality of hotel services and
          amenities. The importance of competition for quality is
          likely to be greater in markets in which hospitals
          compete for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> directly, as they do for all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fee-for-service patients</ENAMEX> and for those enrolled in HMOs
          that offer a choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> within their market.
          Furthermore, to the extent that HMOs make their
          contracting decisions based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary hospital</ENAMEX>
          preferences, perceptions of quality are important
          competitive tools.
          Competition for quality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , unlike competition for
          price [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , may lead to increased costs. Furthermore,
          it may affect clinical and hotel services differently. In
          markets where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> are
          increasingly important, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> are likely to compete
          more on quality attributes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> observe and
          value. Given the difficulty that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have in
          directly determining the quality of medical care they
          receive, and the relative ease with which they can
          evaluate the quality of hotel services (e.g. condition of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> face incentives
          to shift resources from clinical activities to amenities.
          On the other hand, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rely on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s
          recommendations in choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and to the
          degree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> can assess clinical quality,
          albeit imperfectly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> are faced with counter
          incentives, incentives that would promote resource use in
          clinical activities rather than hotel services. As a
          result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may face conflicting incentives:
          incentives to maintain or enhance the quality of hotel
          services on the one hand, and incentives to maintain
          activities that contribute to the quality of clinical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> and health outcomes on the other. The actual choices
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> make about resource allocation depend on
          the relative strength of these opposing incentives.
        
        
          A model of changes in resource allocation
          As the main hypothesis of interest is that the change
          in the nature of competition was associated with changes
          in hospital resource allocations, the model we
          hypothesize allows the marginal effects of market and
          hospital characteristics (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) on resource allocation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ), as measured by the coefficients
          in a regression model (β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ), to vary over time:
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)     
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= α</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ β</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           
          X 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ ε</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           
          The models we estimated were difference models of the
          form
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2)     Δ</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δα</NUMEX> + Δβ *

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> + β 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           * Δ 
          X + Δε
          where Δ is the difference between year t and the base
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, indicated by t = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. From (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) it follows that β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , the vector of coefficients
          multiplying the change variables, measures the marginal
          effect of the variable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end year</TIMEX>, while Δβ, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> of coefficients multiplying the level variables,
          measures the change in the marginal effect. The marginal
          relationship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 0</TIMEX> is given by β 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = β 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">- Δβ..</ENAMEX>
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sample
          The initial sample included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 338</NUMEX> acute care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> that were in operation during
          both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 and 1989</TIMEX>. Of those, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3%</NUMEX>) were excluded
          from the resource allocation analyses and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4%</NUMEX>) were
          excluded from the mortality analyses, because of
          incomplete data.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> sources
          Financial, ownership and utilization data were
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Annual Financial Disclosure</ENAMEX>
          Reports, filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHPD</ENAMEX>). Risk adjusted mortality data were obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Hospital Information Report</ENAMEX> published by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Variable definitions
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Resource</ENAMEX> allocation variables
            Resource allocation was measured by expenditures per
            adjusted discharge. Adjusted discharges are a composite
            measure of input designed to account for both inpatient
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discharges</ENAMEX> and outpatient visits, using the methodology
            developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Hospital Association</ENAMEX>.
            Expenditures per adjusted discharge were calculated
            separately for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: clinical, hotel and
            administrative services. Expenditures were aggregated
            by cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, with each cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center</ENAMEX> assigned to one
            of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>. The table in the Additional
            File: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendixlists</ENAMEX> all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and their
            assignment to hotel, clinical and administrative
            categories. The dependent variables in the resource
            allocation analyses were defined as the differences in
            expenditures per adjusted discharge, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1989</TIMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories.
          
          
            II. Quality variables
            The dependent variables for the analyses of quality
            of clinical care were excess death rates from all
            causes and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> specific medical conditions that have
            relatively high death rates: acute myocardial
            infarction, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. We included in the analyses measures based on
            cause specific mortality in addition to overall
            mortality because prior studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] have shown that
            these measures tend to be uncorrelated, and that
            hospitals performing well in one clinical area do not
            necessarily perform well in others. Measures based on
            overall mortality may therefore be biased towards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>,
            showing less variation compared with cause specific
            measures.
            Excess mortality was defined as the difference
            between the observed mortality rate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
            and a predicted, risk adjusted mortality rate. Observed
            and predicted mortality rates were obtained from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Hospital Reports</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . They are based on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> discharges and include all deaths within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of admission, irrespective of the location of
            death. The risk adjustment methodology used by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX>, incorporates
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' age, gender, specific diagnoses
            and comorbidities, admission <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, emergency or
            elective admission and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> based
            on hospitalizations during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding 6 months</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
            .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. Independent variables
            Competition was measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herfindahl</ENAMEX>-Hirschman
            Index (HHI), defined as the sum of squared market
            shares of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> competing in the same area.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> market areas and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHI</ENAMEX> were calculated based
            on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> zip code level patient flows, as described
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zwanziger et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
            To control for financial pressures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may
            have been experiencing in addition to competition, we
            included variables measuring bad debt and charity as
            percent of total revenues and percent occupancy. To
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for potential economies of scale the estimated
            models included total clinical standard units of
            measures reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Financial</ENAMEX>
            Disclosure Reports. Ownership indicator variables
            included for-profit, not-for profit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, and not-for
            profit district ownership. The omitted category was
            private not-for profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Teaching status was
            defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. All payer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>-based case mix index was included to account for
            differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' severity. Median family income
            measured for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s zip code area was included
            to capture demand effects and as a proxy for cross
            sectional wage variations.
          
        
        
          Analyses
          We estimated regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in which change in
          expenditures per adjusted discharge and excess mortality
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> were the dependent variables. Because all models
          were heteroskedastic, all reported tests of significance
          are based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>'s robust standard errors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ramsey RESET</ENAMEX> test for specification errors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to rule out the need for non-linear
          and interaction terms.
          The mortality <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were weighted by the inverse of
          the standard error for the predicted mortality rate, to
          account for differences across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in the accuracy
          of the excess mortality measures, which are due to
          differences in sample sizes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          Since initial analyses indicated different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (different βs) for for-profit and non-profit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, we estimated fully interacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, in which
          all variables were interacted with for-profit status. The
          hypotheses of significant marginal effect were therefore
          tested for the non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> by a t test of the
          main effect and for the for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> by an F test
          of the linear restriction that the sum of the
          coefficients of the main and interaction effect are
          zero.

        Results
        
          Description of sample hospitals
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1presents</ENAMEX> descriptive statistics for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> included in the study. The majority of
          hospitals (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52.6%</NUMEX>) were private non-profit with the second
          largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.0%</NUMEX>) being for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">four percent</NUMEX> were teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. The
          average hospital size did not change significantly over
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982-1989</TIMEX> period, remaining at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">190-200 beds.</ENAMEX>
          Occupancies declined significantly, from an average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.3% to 55.2%</NUMEX>, and inpatient case mix increased
          significantly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.17 to 1.27</NUMEX>, indicating that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were treating sicker and more expensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the end of the period. Both total
          expenditures and expenditures per adjusted discharge
          increased significantly.
          The degree of competition among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> has not
          changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1989</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHI</ENAMEX> of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          suggests that competition was limited. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markets</ENAMEX> with HHI
          values below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX> are considered moderately or very
          competitive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ). The large variation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHI</ENAMEX>,
          however, indicates that many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were located in
          competitive markets, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in markets
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHI</ENAMEX> below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>.
          Overall mortality rates averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. Average observed
          and predicted rates were very similar, but the variation
          in rates was higher for the observed rates compared with
          the predicted rates, suggesting substantial variations in
          excess mortality and quality across the sample.
        
        
          Resource allocation changes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2reports</ENAMEX> the mean values for the dependent and
          independent variables included in the multivariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regressions</ENAMEX>. Table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3reports</TIMEX> results by ownership -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">for-profit</ENAMEX> and non-profit. These results are based on a
          fully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interacted</TIMEX> model estimated over pooled data by
          ownership. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were highly significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). The clinical services model explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> of the
          variation in expenditures per adjusted discharge, while
          the hotel and administrative services models explained
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24% and 26%</NUMEX> respectively.
        
        
          Effect of competition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5presents</ENAMEX> the marginal effect of competition,
          calculated from the regression results and using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equations 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 and 1989</TIMEX>, as well as the
          change in these coefficients between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. (Note
          that the regression coefficients for the HHI variable
          were multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>, such that a positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> means that expenditures per discharge
          increase with increased competition.)
          Non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in more competitive areas had
          higher expenditures per adjusted discharge in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          categories in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all years</TIMEX>. The marginal effect was highest
          in clinical areas and lowest in administrative services.
          It declined significantly over time in both clinical and
          hotel services, but not in administrative services. The
          decline was almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as large in the clinical
          services compared with hotel services. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, while the
          marginal effect of competition on expenditures in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> was still positive, it was no longer
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. These findings are
          consistent with the hypothesis that the focus of
          competition on quality in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> has diminished
          significantly over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year period</TIMEX> we studied.
          The results for for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> present a
          different picture. First, the association between
          expenditures per adjusted discharge and competition was
          statically significant only for administrative services.
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was also by far the strongest. It was
          negative, indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in more competitive
          markets spent less per discharge on administrative
          activities. The marginal effect was slightly smaller in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in more competitive areas
          may have reallocated resources into administrative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. They may have, for example, invested in better
          information and management systems that would allow them
          to better control costs.
          The association between competition and resource use
          was negative in clinical services and positive in hotel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
          for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> compete on quality in those areas
          that can be easily observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, namely hotel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, and cut back on resources in clinical services,
          where quality is more difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to evaluate
          directly. The change over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1982 through 1989</TIMEX> period is
          also consistent with this hypothesis: the negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between competition and clinical resources
          increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> as did the positive association between
          hotel resources and competition. The lack of significance
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> may reflect the smaller number of
          for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in the sample and the resulting
          lower statistical power. (There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> for-profit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> independent variables, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237</NUMEX>
          non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.)
        
        
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and market characteristics
          The strongest and most consistent relationship was
          between all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> case mix and expenditures per adjusted
          discharge in all categories (see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> was substantially stronger for the clinical
          category and in non-profit compared with for-profit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
          Most other variables either exhibited no significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> or no clear patterns. There were no
          significant differences in resource allocations by
          ownership. Teaching status was positively associated with
          clinical and hotel expenditures among the non-profit
          hospitals but exhibited a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> among the
          for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Percent bad debt and charity and
          percent occupancy had no significant relationship with
          expenditures among the non-profit but were associated
          with lower clinical and administrative expenditures among
          the for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Median family income was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with higher expenditure levels for all
          services among the non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, but only with the
          clinical services among the for-profits.
        
        
          Risk adjusted excess mortality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4reports</ENAMEX> the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regressions</ENAMEX> modeling
          the association between excess mortality (defined as the
          difference between observed and predicted mortality rate)
          and clinical expenditures per adjusted discharge,
          competition, ownership, and teaching status. The models
          explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 1% and 5%</NUMEX> of the variation in excess
          mortality. In all cases there was a negative association
          between clinical expenditure levels and excess mortality,
          implying that increased resources were associated with
          better mortality outcomes. This relationship was present
          for mortality from all causes as well as from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          specific causes, and was statistically significant at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.10</NUMEX> level or better.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6shows</ENAMEX> the increase in excess mortality that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> standard deviation (SD)
          in clinical expenditures per adjusted discharge, based on
          the estimated regression coefficients. For comparison,
          the table also provides the magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> in excess
          mortality among the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. In all cases, the
          effect of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 SD</NUMEX> in resources was less than a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 SD</NUMEX> in
          excess mortality. As expected due to the potential bias
          towards zero in the measures based on all causes, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> were larger for the cause specific
          measures.
          As discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, we hypothesized that competition
          may affect quality, including clinical quality, not only
          through its impact on resource use but also due to
          incentives to compete on quality. If indeed hospitals
          were competing on clinical quality, the association
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHI</ENAMEX> and excess mortality, controlling for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use, should have been positive and significant.
          In all cases, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, we did not find a
          significant relationship. In most cases there was also no
          significant relationship between ownership or teaching
          status and excess mortality.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this paper we present a test of the hypothesis that
        changes in the nature of competition among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, resulting from selective contracting, were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>' resource allocation
        decisions. We find empirical evidence to suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> have been shifted from clinical activities (which
        are not observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and into hotel services
        (which are more readily observable). These changes in
        resource allocation tended to be larger in hospitals
        located in more competitive areas. As the level of
        competition has not changed during the study period, the
        change in hospital behavior is likely to be a response to
        the change in the nature of competition.
        The relationship between resource allocation and
        competition differed by ownership. For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in
        more competitive areas had lower expenditures levels
        compared with those in less competitive areas. Among
        non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, we found the opposite - clinical
        expenditures per adjusted discharge increased with
        competition. The trend over time, however, even though it
        was much stronger among the non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, was the
        same for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. For both, the change in the marginal
        effect of competition (Δβ) was negative. As a result, the
        positive association between competition and clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use among non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> diminished and the
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> among the for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        increased.
        The analyses of excess mortality demonstrate that
        clinical quality, at least as measured here, is positively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the amount of resources used in producing
        clinical services. Therefore, policies that create
        incentives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to limit resource use are likely
        to have an impact on health outcomes. Furthermore, as
        clinical quality is not easily observable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>,
        leading to disparity in incentives to provide hotel and
        clinical quality, more competitive areas are likely to
        experience a larger relative decline in resources allocated
        to clinical activities and hence worse mortality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
        The impact on health outcomes in non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        may not be as large as it might have been because
        expenditure levels were curtailed not only in clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, but in hotel services as well, although to a much
        lesser degree. This strategy spread the burden of cost
        containment efforts beyond clinical activities. If
        non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> would have concentrated all their cost
        cutting efforts in clinical services, as did the for-profit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, the impact on costs, and potentially on
        mortality outcomes, would have been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> higher (see table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The generalizability of the findings presented here is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in several ways. First, quality was measured only
        in terms of excess mortality. While this is an important
        aspect of quality, it is likely to be an insensitive
        measure. Because measures based on mortality do not tend to
        be correlated with measures based on other outcomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        , such as complications, one cannot deduce from this study
        that other aspects of clinical quality have been affected
        similarly by the changes in competition during the period.
        Furthermore, the mortality models we estimated, unlike the
        expenditures models, were cross sectional and are therefore
        subject to the usual concerns about potential bias due to
        omitted hospital specific effects. It should be noted,
        however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> did include the variables most
        likely to be associated with excess mortality - patient
        level risks, expenditures, competition, ownership and
        teaching status. It should also be noted that while our
        findings with respect to changes in resource allocation are
        based on total expenditures, thus reflecting care for all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the mortality outcomes are based on the
        experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> only. Prior studies,
        however, suggest that patient care given by same provider
        does not vary by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> status [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        A more important generalizability question arises due to
        the sample selected for this study - namely hospitals
        located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. Can the
        behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> observed in this local and during
        this time period be assumed to generalize to other markets
        and other times? While the magnitude of the effects we
        measure in this study are clearly not generalizable, the
        directions of the effects are likely to transcend time and
        place, as they reflect basic behavioral responses to market
        incentives in accordance with theory. While this sample
        selection may be viewed as a limitation of this study, it
        is also its strength. By focusing on a period in which
        levels of competition were stable and where the change in
        the nature of competition can be traced to a specific
        legislative act, this study is able to test for the
        differential impact of price vs. quality competition,
        without confounding by other factors.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, the results of this study should be viewed
        as raising a cautionary question: are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> cost
        reductions that have been observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and
        nationally [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] associated with increased mortality?
