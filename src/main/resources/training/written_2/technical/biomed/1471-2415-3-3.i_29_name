        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alpha-Crystallin</ENAMEX> is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polypeptides,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphaA-crystallin</ENAMEX> (alphaA) and alphaB-crystallin (alphaB),
        which share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence homology</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . They
        are the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ]
        and exist as heteroaggregates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 800</NUMEX> kDa that
        can undergo inter-aggregate subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The
        expression of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> epithelium,
        however, is not uniform throughout different regions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> epithelium. AlphaB expression is detected in
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epithelium</ENAMEX> and increases from the central to
        elongation zones, where epithelial cells differentiate into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX>. AlphaA, however, is not detected in the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epithelium</ENAMEX>. The relative proportion of alphaA and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaB</ENAMEX> changes from a molar ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX> in the pericentral
        and germative zones to a molar ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 in the</TIMEX>
        elongation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . These differences
        in the relative proportions of alphaA and alphaB within the
        lens suggest different functions for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits in
        the developing lens.
        Prior to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s, alpha-crystallin was thought to be
        a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> whose major cellular function was to
        produce a dense solution necessary for the refraction of
        light in the lens. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990</TIMEX>'s,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> was shown to act as a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX>,
        binding to partially denatured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, both 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and probably 
        in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , to inhibit further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denaturation</ENAMEX> and aggregation of lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaA</ENAMEX> and
        alphaB were also shown to have sequence homology with
        several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the small heat
        shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (hsp) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX>, particularly alphaB, was shown to not be
        restricted to the lens. AlphaB was found to be expressed at
        significant levels in a variety of nonlenticular tissues,
        while alphaA has only been detected in small amounts in a
        few other tissues such as retina, spleen and thymus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Collectively, these findings have challenged
        the dogma that alpha-crystallin is purely a structural
        protein necessary for light refraction, and have led to the
        realization that alpha-crystallin may have a variety of
        biological functions in the lens.
        A much broader scope of cellular functions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> in lens is inferred from 
        in vitro observations. Both alphaA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaB</ENAMEX> can bind specifically to actin, 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Although actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> formation has been shown to be necessary for
        differentiation of lens epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , the
        significance of alpha-crystallin's interaction with actin
        in differentiation is not known. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with type III intermediate
        filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the beaded filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins CP49</ENAMEX> and
        CP115, and correct beaded filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> has been shown
        depend on the presence of alpha-crystallin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Beaded
        filament mRNA levels are greatly increased in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiating lens</ENAMEX> epithelium and have been suggested as
        a pan-specific marker for lens fiber development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> has also been shown to interact directly
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfected CHO cells</ENAMEX>, alphaB has also
        been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei,
        suggesting a role for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        A nuclear role for alphaB in the lens was supported by the
        findings that a subset of lens epithelial cells derived
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alphaB knockout mice</ENAMEX> demonstrated hyperproliferation
        and genomic instability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In addition, the
        administration of exogenous alpha-crystallin to primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bovine lens</ENAMEX> epithelial cell cultures resulted in the
        formation of lentoid bodies, consistent with a role for
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in lens differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . These
        findings indicate that alpha-crystallin may have a
        multitude of 
        in vivo functions.
        One approach to resolving some of the 
        in vivo functions of alpha-crystallin
        is to generate animal models where one or both of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-crystallin gene products have been eliminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady</ENAMEX>
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] demonstrated, by targeted disruption of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> alphaA gene, that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was essential for the
        maintenance of lens transparency, possibly by maintaining
        the solubility of alphaB, or associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>. These lenses were also reported to be smaller in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equatorial</ENAMEX> and light axial dimensions than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched wild
        type lens. It was not possible using the techniques
        employed in the study to determine if the smaller lenses
        were due to reduced volume or number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX>.
        Targeted disruption of the mouse alphaB gene resulted in
        lenses similar in size to aged-matched wild type lens.
        Moreover, no cataract formation was observed in the alphaB
        knockout lenses. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have muscle cell
        abnormalities, severe postural anomalies, selective muscle
        degeneration, and shorter life spans compared to normal
        controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        In the single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alpha-crystallin knockout mice</ENAMEX>, the
        remaining alpha-crystallin may fully or partially
        compensate for some of the functions of the missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>, where both alphaA and
        alphaB are normally expressed at high levels. The
        objectives of the current report were to characterize gross
        morphology of young (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 wk</NUMEX>) and old (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54 wk</NUMEX>) mouse lenses
        with targeted disruption of both the alphaA and alphaB
        genes, in comparison to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched wild type lenses, using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">scanning electron microscopy</ENAMEX> (SEM) and confocal microscopy,
        to elucidate the possible functions of alpha-crystallin in
        the lens. The results indicate that alpha-crystallin is
        necessary for proper fiber cell formation and resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> transparency.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Lenses
          The wild type mouse strain used in this study was the
          129SvEvTac <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. Lenses examined were from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> lenses),
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> lenses) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> lenses) wk old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> was generated by cross breeding

          in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">129Sv</NUMEX> background. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also lack the HSPB2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Lenses examined were from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 wk</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
          lenses) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> lenses) old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          treated in accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association for Research</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ophthalmology Statement</ENAMEX> for the Use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ophthalmic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision Research</ENAMEX>.
          Immediately after euthanizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, eyes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enucleated</ENAMEX>. A scalpel blade was then used to make a small
          incision into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior chamber</ENAMEX> near the equator and
          then both eyes from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were immersed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          ml fixative (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) paraformaldehyde and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 7.2</NUMEX>). Eyes were fixed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> hr at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (RT) prior to dissection of the lenses. At
          this time, equatorial and axial dimensions of lenses and
          gross lenticular appearance were recorded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
          analyses on data consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-test, means and
          standard deviation, using the statistical software

        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equatorial</ENAMEX> and axial (sagittal) dimensions of lenses,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wks of age were significantly
        smaller (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), both equatorially and axially, than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old wild type lenses and remain smaller throughout
        life. Fifty-four wk old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses were much smaller
        than similarly aged normal lenses, and were similar in size
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old wild type lenses. Both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old wild type
        lenses and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses were
        significantly smaller (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 or 72</NUMEX> wk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> wild type lenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wks of age
        exhibited vacuoles at the equatorial region (Figure 1Asee
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>) and an area of slight light scatter at the
        posterior subcapsular regions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Bsee</NUMEX> arrowheads). By
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">54 wks</TIMEX> of age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses exhibited dense cortical

        were observed in any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses examined. All
        wild type lenses were transparent upon removal from the eye
        (Figure 1D,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1F</ENAMEX>) and had well defined posterior

        equatorial/bow region was not observed in these older
        lenses, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> extending to the posterior capsule
        of the lens were not found. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disorganized</ENAMEX> cellular material
        capped the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">anterior region</ENAMEX> of the embryonic/fetal nucleus,
        and a distinctive indentation of the lens mass at the
        equatorial region was apparent in mid-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">axial</NUMEX> sections as
        well as whole lenses. In alphaA/BKO lenses the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">embryonic/</ENAMEX>fetal nucleus (primary lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>) had migrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posteriorly</ENAMEX> and appeared to be in contact with the
        posterior capsule. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> wk old wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lenses</ENAMEX> (Figure 2C,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2E</ENAMEX>), however, there was no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior subcapsular nucleic acid staining</ENAMEX> and
        the embryonic-fetal nucleus was centrally located, not in
        contact with the posterior capsule.
        At higher magnification, examination of sections stained
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYTOX</ENAMEX> green revealed ultrastructural
        differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses and wild type lenses
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> epithelial staining in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old wild type lenses were
        similar (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3K</NUMEX>) with respect to nuclear staining with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYTOX</ENAMEX> green. However, some differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> wk old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3F</NUMEX>) were observed in the central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> epithelium compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 wk</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3K</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3P</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> wk (data not shown) wild type lenses.
        These differences included changes in central epithelial
        nuclear staining, nuclear shape and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">epithelial</NUMEX> thickness
        and continuity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Superficial</ENAMEX> and deep anterior cortical
        staining was grossly different between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO (Figure
        3A,3D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3I</ENAMEX>) and wild type lenses (Figure 3K,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>,3Pand
        3S). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 54</NUMEX> wk old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, superficial and
        deep anterior cortical regions, stained for lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>, did not reveal any patterns typical of fiber
        cells cut in cross-section or longitudinal section. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses there was a high density of stained
        membranes per unit area throughout the cortex, with no
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid staining</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO
        lenses, large, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregularly</ENAMEX> shaped cells were observed,
        interspersed among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of high membrane staining
        density per unit area. These large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> were not
        vacuoles, because examination of the interior of these
        structures by transmitted and reflected light microscopy
        showed that the membranes encompassed cellular material
        (data not shown). In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid staining</ENAMEX> was
        observed (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Fand 3I</ENAMEX>) within many of these cells
        exhibiting large cross-sectional profiles. In the wild type
        lenses, typical cross-sectional patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX>
        organized in radial columns were observed (Figure
        3K,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3S</ENAMEX>).
        Ultrastructural differences at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow region
        were also observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses (Figure 3Band
        3G) and wild type lenses (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Land 3Q</ENAMEX>). In contrast to
        wild type lenses (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Land 3Q</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses
        (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Band 3G</ENAMEX>) contained large areas devoid of cellular
        material, their nuclei were not limited to a well defined
        equatorial/bow region, and ordered radial columns of
        elongating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells extending</ENAMEX> from the posterior capsule
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anterior epithelium</ENAMEX> were not observed. In addition
        to the equatorial region, ultrastructural differences
        between alphaA/BKO lenses (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Cand 3H</ENAMEX>) and wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lenses</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Mand 3R</ENAMEX>) were observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> of
        the embryonic and fetal nucleus. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>), a greater variation in cross sectional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> was observed, with cell diameters ranging from
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microns up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 25</NUMEX> microns,
        compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk wild type lenses, whose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diameters</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2</NUMEX> microns up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> microns (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Mand 3R</ENAMEX>). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk, these
        cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses were larger in cross
        sectional diameter than wild type, and exhibited a much
        greater variation in the cross sectional size and cell
        shape.
        Cells adjacent to the posterior capsule of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3E</NUMEX>) exhibited nucleic acid
        staining, were small and non-elongated, with numerous
        membrane projections., These were, however, not observed in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">54 wk</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, deep to
        the posterior capsule, larger diameter cells, similar to
        those observed in the embryonic/fetal nucleus were observed
        (data not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fiber cells</ENAMEX> of similar dimension and
        appearance to embryonic/fetal nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were seen at
        the posterior capsule in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses (Figure
        3J). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both 5 and 54</TIMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, no posterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sutures</ENAMEX> could be found in any axial or equatorial vibratome
        sections examined. Posterior sutures were readily found in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vibratome</ENAMEX> sections of wild type lenses (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3O</TIMEX>, arrow).
        Fiber cells attached to the posterior capsule and extending
        anteriorly were observed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 wk</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3O</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk (Figure
        3T) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> wk (data not shown) wild type lenses.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> confirmed many of the observations made by confocal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow region, a disorganized
        array of relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregular</ENAMEX> shaped cells were
        observed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 wk</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses, while elongated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> organized
        into radial columns, with ball and socket interdigitations,
        were observed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 wk</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4G</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4J</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wk</ENAMEX> (data not shown) wild type lenses. In the anterior
        cortical region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, radial columns
        of cells with numerous cell surface projections were
        observed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>), but these radial columns were no
        longer present at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54 weeks of age</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4E</NUMEX>). In these
        older lenses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregularly</ENAMEX> shaped, convoluted cells, with no
        recognizable pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, were present. In
        contrast, radial columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elongated fiber cells</ENAMEX> of
        uniform size and shape, with ball and socket
        interdigitations, were present in the anterior cortical
        region of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 wk</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4H</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> wk (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4K</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> week
        (data not shown) wild type lenses. The posterior
        subcapsular regions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 wk</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk (Figure
        4F) alphaA/BKO lenses were filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregularly</ENAMEX> shaped
        cells with numerous cell surface projections. In the
        fetal/embryonic nucleus, elongated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> with
        numerous long, finger-like projections and furrowed
        membranes were evident (not shown). No elongated cells
        extending from the bow region to the posterior capsule of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses were observed. In contrast, radial
        columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elongated fiber cells</ENAMEX> of uniform size and shape
        containing ball and socket interdigitations were observed
        in the posterior subcapsular region in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 wk</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4I</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wk</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4L</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> wk (data not shown) wild type lenses,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> in contact with the posterior capsule could
        be traced back to the equatorial bow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and anterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        One approach to resolving some of the 
        in vivo functions of alpha-crystallin
        is to generate animal models where one or both of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-crystallin gene products have been eliminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady</ENAMEX>
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] demonstrated, by targeted disruption of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> alphaA gene, that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was essential for the
        maintenance of lens transparency, possibly by maintaining
        the solubility of alphaB, or associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>. These lenses were also reported to be smaller in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equatorial</ENAMEX> and axial dimensions than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>, which was very similar to that which was observed
        with the double knockout lens. Targeted disruption of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> alphaB gene, however, resulted in lenses similar in
        size to aged-matched wild type lens with no cataracts
        reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This indicates that alphaA may play a
        greater role in maintaining the transparency of the lens
        then alphaB. In the single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alpha-crystallin knockout mice</ENAMEX>,
        the remaining alpha-crystallin may fully or partially
        compensate for some of the functions of the missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>, where both alphaA and
        alphaB are normally expressed at high levels. This was
        supported by the morphological observation made in this
        study of no posterior sutures or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> extending to
        the posterior capsule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>, ectopically staining
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the posterior subcapsular region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk
        and anterior subcapsular cortex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk, gross
        morphological differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow, posterior
        and anterior regions of lenses from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as
        compared to wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. None of these morphological
        differences have been reported in the single alphaA or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alphaB knockout mice</ENAMEX>. It must be noted, however, that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also lack the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HSPB2</NUMEX> gene product [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and
        the contribution of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to normal lens morphology
        and functions should not be overlooked. Future studies
        should address the possible functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSPB2</ENAMEX> in normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>.
        The results of the current study support the hypothesis
        that alpha-crystallin plays an active role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and growth of lens fiber cells. Normal
        differentiation of lens fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> consists of a
        progression from a simple cuboidal epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
        containing a nucleus and a minimal numbers of organelles,
        to a stratified layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elongated fiber</ENAMEX>-like cells, devoid
        of nuclei and organelles. Differentiation of epithelial
        cells occurs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>,
        where epithelial cells begin to elongate and differentiate
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> of uniform cellular shape, arranged in
        radial columns of cells extending from the anterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> to the posterior capsule. This process did not
        appear to have proceeded normally in lenses lacking alphaA
        and alphaB. The morphological observations presented in
        this study demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> in lenses lacking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaB</ENAMEX> fail to elongate symmetrically from the
        bow region and therefore do not establish the typical
        "onion skin" conformation in which cells extend from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> epithelium to the posterior capsule. Additionally,
        in lenses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, there was a
        persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell nuclei</ENAMEX> in deeper cortical regions, and
        ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell nuclei</ENAMEX> were present in large numbers in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">anterior</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cortex</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wks of age cell nuclei were
        present, adjacent to the posterior capsule. These
        morphological observations are consistent with a defect in
        the normal differentiation pathway of lens epithelial cells
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX>.
        It is unlikely that these alterations in alphaA/BKO
        mouse lenses result from increased susceptibility of these
        lenses to light-induced damage in the absence of the
        molecular chaperone protection afforded by alphaA and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaB</ENAMEX> in normal lenses. With the normal time of eye
        opening at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 14 days</TIMEX> after birth, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had their eyes open and lenses exposed to light for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> prior to morphological analysis.
        Moreover, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had been exposed to only animal
        facility fluorescent lighting and were protected from UV
        light by plastic cages. If lack of protection from
        light-induced damage was the major factor affecting the
        changes in these lenses, then the bulk of the damage should
        have resided along the visual axis, particularly in the
        central anterior epithelium and subcapsular cortex in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        wk lenses, but this was not the case. In these lenses,
        gross morphological changes were apparent in the equatorial
        and posterior subcapsular regions. These changes included
        posterior subcapsular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid staining</ENAMEX>, absence of
        posterior sutures, and small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregularly</ENAMEX> shaped cells, not
        arranged in any discernable pattern, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow
        region. Systemic stress factors crossing the blood/aqueous
        barrier might explain some morphological changes at the
        equatorial region, but this would not explain nucleic acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the posterior subcapsular region. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid staining</ENAMEX> in the posterior
        subcapsular region is consistent with either anterior
        epithelial cells migrating aberrantly to the posterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pole</ENAMEX>, or primary fiber cells failing to fully differentiate
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wks of age. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities could not be
        differentiated in the methods employed, and were beyond the
        objectives of the current study. Future studies are being
        designed to address which of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes might
        explain nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid staining</ENAMEX> in the posterior subcapsular
        region. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staining</ENAMEX> in this region was not observed in older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses, suggesting that this pattern was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transient</ENAMEX>. The fate of the nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-containing cells</ENAMEX> in
        the posterior capsular region of younger lenses is not
        known at this time, nor is the morphology of earlier stage
        lenses. Future studies with defined objectives to address
        the development and progression of morphological changes
        seen in this study are being designed. The morphological
        differences in alphaA/BKO lenses, compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched
        wild type lenses, were consistent with the hypothesis that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> plays an active role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and growth of lens fiber cells. In
        addition, it was clearly evident that alpha-crystallin is
        necessary for lens transparency.
        The final biological event in a lens epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>'s
        life is the transformation from an epithelial cell into a
        fiber cell, which occurs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equatorial</ENAMEX>/bow region of
        the lens. The newly forming fiber cell continues to
        differentiate in the cortex until a mature fiber cell
        devoid of organelles with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suture</ENAMEX> formation at the ends of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is formed. This entire process from epithelial
        cell to mature fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is defined as lens
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. The precise spatial and temporal
        expression of the crystallin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lens</ENAMEX> may not be simply a consequence of the differentiation
        process, but instead may play an important, if not
        essential, role in the differentiation process itself. The
        results of the current study support this hypothesis.
        The exact 
        in vivo molecular mechanisms, by
        which alpha-crystallin might influence lens epithelial cell
        differentiation, and maintenance of lens transparency,
        remain to be determined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaA</ENAMEX> and alphaB are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the shsp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Previous studies have shown that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> possesses molecular chaperone
        activity, binding to partially denatured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, both 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and probably 
        in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , to inhibit further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denaturation</ENAMEX>. Although this property may be a major
        contributor to the maintenance of lens clarity, the early
        changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses indicate a much broader
        cellular function for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX>. Stress proteins
        have been shown to be expressed in non-stressed cells
        during development and differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Hsps were
        shown to be expressed during the differentiation of
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">promelocytic leukemia</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        ] . In addition, hsp expression has been shown to accompany
        growth arrest in human B lymphocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and macrophage
        differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HL</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . During myogenic
        differentiation, mRNA for alphaB increases in conjunction
        with the induction of mRNA for myogenin, the earliest known
        event in myogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The addition of exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> to primary bovine lens epithelium was
        shown to induce rapid changes in cell shape, leading to the
        formation of lentoid bodies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . These studies strongly
        suggest that the hsp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has other functions
        in addition to protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and cells during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> may play a functional role in the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and may have a role in regulating the cell cycle.
        Several heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been found in cell nuclei
        in the absence of stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and alpha-crystallin has
        been shown to interact directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . AlphaB,
        expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfected CHO cells</ENAMEX>, has been shown to
        ectopically localize to interphase nuclei, suggesting a
        regulatory role for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . A
        subset of immortalized lens epithelial cells from alphaBKO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been shown to hyperproliferate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] suggesting
        that alphaB may be important in maintaining genomic
        stability. In lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> derived from alphaAKO lenses,
        cell growth rates were reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> lower compared to
        wild type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , suggesting a role for alphaA in
        regulating the cell cycle. All of these findings raise many
        questions as to the possible role(s) of alpha-crystallin in
        the nucleus and in cell cycle regulation during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. In the current study, the observation of a
        disorganized pattern of nuclei localized to the equatorial
        bow region of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alphaA</ENAMEX>/BKO lenses, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> staining
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> throughout the anterior cortex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> wk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphaA/BKO</ENAMEX> lenses, is consistent with a role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> in the nucleus.
        There is extensive evidence from previous studies
        demonstrating that alpha-crystallin plays a role in the
        cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Both alphaA and alphaB can bind
        specifically to actin, both 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Actin filament
        formation has been shown to be necessary for the
        differentiation of lens epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , however,
        the significance of alpha-crystallin interaction with actin
        in differentiation is not known. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-crystallin</ENAMEX> also forms a complex with type III
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament proteins</ENAMEX> and the lens-specific beaded
        filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins CP49</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CP115</ENAMEX>, which may be critical for
        proper filament assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Beaded filament mRNA
        levels increase greatly in differentiating lens epithelial
        cells, and have been suggested as a pan-specific marker for
        lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . It is therefore possible that
        increased synthesis of alpha-crystallin in epithelial cells
        early in the differentiation process may have profound
        effects upon the cytoskeleton, which in turn may profoundly
        affect cell shape and migration. The lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and uniform cell shape at the equatorial
        region observed in alphaA/BKO lenses supports this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. Studies are currently underway to characterize
        cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the alphaA<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/BKO lens</ENAMEX>.
