        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color</ENAMEX> fundus photographs have been routinely employed
        for diagnostic purposes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, and fundus photo
        gradings are central to clinical studies of macular disease
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The natural history of age-related macular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the
        developed world [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , is in particular tied to that of
        subretinal deposits known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drusen</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . Drusen are key in the classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMD</ENAMEX>, hence the
        importance of drusen identification and measurement in
        clinical studies. The classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by stage
        of age-related maculopathy involves painstaking analysis of
        drusen size, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>, area and morphology in several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcategories</ENAMEX>. Significant effort has been placed in
        developing and validating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grading Systems</ENAMEX>. The systematic study of
        drusen resorption following laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">photocoagulation</ENAMEX> also
        underscores the importance of drusen measurement and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        There has been continued interest in the use of digital
        techniques for quantification of macular pathology,
        particularly drusen, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two decades</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . However, despite progress, none of
        these methods have gained widespread use. A major obstacle
        has been that the reflectance of the normal background, on
        which the pathology is superimposed, is inherently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-uniform</ENAMEX>. In particular, the normally less reflectant
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">macula</ENAMEX> is superimposed on whatever the underlying
        or "true" drusen reflectance might be. Hence, given <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anatomically</ENAMEX> identical drusen, one in the center of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macula</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> Î¼m, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> will see them
        differently in the fundus photograph. The outlying drusen
        will appear brighter and larger than its identical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. The human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> with training makes allowances
        for this variability, but a computer applying a threshold
        does not.
        Prior methods have so far been unable to deal with this
        non-uniform macular background reflectance as a whole. An
        early study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] used adaptive thresholding techniques on
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1024</TIMEX> separate windows of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 Ã— 8 pixels</NUMEX>. Perivascular windows
        sometimes incorrectly interpreted bimodal distributions as
        coming from perivascular drusen. Large areas of background
        were also sometimes included due to incorrect choices of
        threshold. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error required many operator
        interventions to correct. The result was a method that was
        capable of excellent reproducibility (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</NUMEX>), but was
        too tedious for general use. Hence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1986</TIMEX> the
        limiting factor was not the time complexity of computer
        algorithms, but the fact that the method itself was tied to
        local reflectance calculations. This problem persisted in a
        recent study that relied on applying local thresholds to
        regions ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 100</TIMEX> pixels square [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Drusen were identified first by checking the local
        histogram for sufficient skewness (equivalent in this
        method to determining that drusen were present in the
        region) and then setting a local threshold. However, the
        method was defeated if a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">drusen</ENAMEX> dominated a local
        region. In this case the local distribution would not be
        skew, and the large drusen would be completely missed. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> would be required to correct this error manually after
        the automated segmentation. In general, a post-processing
        step was necessary to correct drusen segmentation errors or
        enlarge incompletely segmented drusen to achieve acceptable
        accuracy. These studies demonstrate that segmentation by
        local histograms and threshold techniques has serious
        deficiencies.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapantzikos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> have used other morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> as well as varying local histogram criteria for
        threshold choice to try to correct these deficiencies.
        Their criteria involve kurtosis as well as skewness. The
        fundamental fact remains, as they readily admit, no matter
        how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histogram</ENAMEX>-based criteria are employed for local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">segmentation</ENAMEX>, that widely different combinations of image
        features (drusen and background) can yield the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histogram</ENAMEX>. An extreme example, as in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , would be
        regions that were either all background or all drusen, in
        either case yielding the same mesokurtic nonskewed
        distribution. Their solution, a morphological dilation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, is intended in the all drusen case to distort the
        local histogram by reintroducing background and thereby
        improve threshold recognition. It is unclear, however, that
        this artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> will always perform as intended.
        Another example of the arbitrary application of a general
        tool occurs when their segmentation leaves isolated bright
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of pixels. They conclude if these are in close
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proximity</ENAMEX>, then they possibly belong to the same large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drusen</ENAMEX> and therefore must be expanded by a closing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>. But these could also be isolated small hard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drusen</ENAMEX>. Lastly, despite the use of a wide range of general
        image analysis tools, their methods, as those in the other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, take no account of the intrinsic background
        variability, and accordingly can produce errors in a
        systematic and predictable fashion: inadequate segmentation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centrally</ENAMEX> and over inclusive segmentation in the peripheral
        macula, as their own illustrations demonstrate.
        An alternative to color photography is scanning laser
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ophthalmoscopy</ENAMEX> (SLO) imaging for recognition of bright
        features. This method has been used for detection of
        retinal exudates in diabetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] using a single
        optimized wavelength. The concept has been carried further
        in a multispectral approach using a tunable dye laser [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . The problem of variable illumination and/or intrinsic
        background variability is also addressed by multiple local
        adaptive thresholds, but with a novel addition. Regions of
        the image are designated as "featureless" if the
        coefficient of variation of the local histogram is
        sufficiently small. The mean gray scale values of these
        regions are then used to determine local thresholds, which
        are then interpolated to give a global threshold function.
        Since diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exudates</ENAMEX> tend to be smaller than soft
        drusen, it is unclear if sufficient featureless windows
        would be available in an image with multiple soft drusen to
        apply this method.
        Our approach to this problem has been as follows. We
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstrated that there was an inherent geometric
        pattern to the background reflectance in normal fundus
        images [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . We then developed a semi-automated
        interactive method based on these patterns to level the
        background reflectance of a drusen-containing image
        independent of the reflectivity of the overlying drusen
        (preliminary results presented in abstract form [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ).
        This allows the use of a global threshold to segment the
        drusen accurately. By adopting this unified approach to the
        macular reflectance problem, we avoid the multiple local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX> used in previous approaches [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 24 25</NUMEX>
        ] . It is important to note, however, that our method is
        not the standard technique of shadowing by subtracting or
        dividing by a blur image. These standard techniques [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        (also used herein) are useful for shading correction on
        large scales. As we have shown in our previous work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        , however, the macular reflectance can change significantly
        over ranges of distance (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-100 Î¼m</NUMEX>) comparable to the size
        of pathologic structures of interest. Hence, subtracting
        the variation on this scale would tend to remove such
        structures from the image. Indeed, one reason we are
        presenting our particular method is that we found after
        many trials and errors that none of the standard
        morphological transform routines (dilations, erosion,
        closings) or combinations thereof, were able to precisely
        define the boundary of pathological features in a fundus
        image. We determined that it would be nearly impossible to
        completely automate the process relying solely on
        mathematical morphology. On the other hand, a potential
        advantage of using simpler techniques in less specialized
        software, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> oversight of the final segmentations,
        is portability and use at other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> for macular
        research.
        We report a semi-automated digital method for drusen
        measurement in fundus photographs using commercially
        available software and test it for reliability against the
        current standard of fundus photo grading by stereo pair
        viewing in the central <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000-micron</TIMEX> diameter and middle
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000-micron</TIMEX> subfields.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          The drusen images consisted of stereo pairs of
          standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>-degree film-based color fundus photographs
          centered on the macular regions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinicians</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in AMD
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCWK</ENAMEX>) selected twelve good quality stereo pairs
          of cases with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Stage 2</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 age-related maculopathy</NUMEX> (as
          defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Grading System</ENAMEX>) at random
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Macular Genetics Study</ENAMEX> (CMGS). Hence,
          all cases had soft drusen present but lacked the advanced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> of geographic atrophy or choroidal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neovascularization</ENAMEX>. Pigmentary abnormalities (hyper- or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypopigmentation</ENAMEX>) were not excluded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMGS</ENAMEX> is an
          ongoing cross-sectional case-control study of the
          possible genetic bases of macular degeneration. This
          study has been approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> Presbyterian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>. One photograph from
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was chosen for digitization. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years of age</TIMEX>. Photographs of normal
          maculae from the files of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTS</ENAMEX>) were
          also analyzed.
        
        
          Image acquisition
          All photographs were scanned and digitized (CoolScan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LS-2000</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>) at resolutions
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2700</TIMEX> pixels/inch (actual optical resolution). The
          images were saved <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as 24-bit</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGB TIFF</ENAMEX> files, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX>
          levels of intensity value for each color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Image Processing
          For uniformity of processing, all images were resized
          with bicubic interpolation so that the distance from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the macula to the temporal disc edge was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">490</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pixels</ENAMEX>. These images were smaller than the originals, but
          still contained detail information that was more than
          adequate for our methods. This disc to macula distance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anatomically</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> microns) is a more reliable constant
          than the disc diameter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>) often used as a clinical
          reference scale. We also found this approach more
          reliable than resizing based on camera magnifications. We
          worked completely within commercially available software
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Photoshop 5.5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, CA) on a
          desktop PC. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> studied were the central
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000-micron</TIMEX> diameter circular subfield and the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX>-micron outer diameter annular subfield (with
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000-micron</TIMEX> inner diameter) centered on the fovea (the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> micron diameter anatomical center of the macula).
          These are the central and middle subfields defined by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> grading template [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The outer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX>-micron
          subfield of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> system was not used in this
          study.
          We next corrected the large-scale variation in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brightness</ENAMEX> found in most fundus photographs. The
          non-uniform illumination is a result of the acquisition
          step in the fundus photograph, and is not intrinsic to
          retinal reflectance. The correction process, known as
          shading correction, was carried out independently on each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, and the results combined as the red, green
          and blue channels of a new image. Specifically, each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> was copied, blurred (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> blur, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">450 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radius</ENAMEX>), and then subtracted from the original, with
          constant offset values: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">195</ENAMEX> for red, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> for green and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
          for blue. This is distinct from a difference-of-Gaussian
          operation that requires a much smaller kernel size for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> filter. This new average color was chosen to
          be a typical arbitrary extra-foveal background color, so
          that the result was a color-balanced shading-corrected
          fundus picture recognizable to the human eye. We called
          this the standardized image. While the offsets are
          mathematically arbitrary, and do not affect a study of
          image variation numerically, we found that human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of fundus features was essential. Further
          optimization of visual recognition of fundus features
          could be achieved by contrast enhancement in Photoshop
          (see below).
          The resulting standardized images had the property
          that relative variation in brightness on a small scale
          was preserved with respect to the originals. Large-scale
          photographic variation as a source of bias had been
          removed, and the mean background colors of these images
          were nearly identical. Each standardized image was also
          stored with contrast-enhanced versions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photoshop/Autolevels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autocontrast</ENAMEX>) for ease of
          visual recognition of drusen. We found, as have others [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , that drusen had greater contrast in the green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> than in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, or other combinations
          of channels. All further analysis and drusen segmentation
          were hence carried out on the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> of the
          standardized image, with the full color contrast-enhanced
          versions used for subjective comparison.
        
        
          Macular background leveling in images with
          drusen
          
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Semi-automated method: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX>
            correction
            A major factor in these centrally darker patterns is
            absorbance by luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>. We found in our
            mathematical modeling (data not presented) that fits to
            macular data were significantly improved when the
            region with evident luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> was fit separately.
            Hence, if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX> was evident (as judged by the
            presence of a disc of characteristic yellowish
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coloration</ENAMEX> in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">macula</ENAMEX>, or marked central
            background darkening consistent with that of luteal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigment</ENAMEX>), this region was corrected <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The
            corrections in this step were all multiplicative.
            As an absorber, luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> will reduce the
            brightness of each underlying structure by a
            percentage. We therefore constructed appropriate
            annular zones in the macula for percentage
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multiplicative</NUMEX>) increases in brightness to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empirically</ENAMEX> determined using published data on the
            spatial distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macular pigment</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
            These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> found that the macular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> density
            (hence optical density) is greatest centrally, drops to
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximum within a diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 to 600 Î¼m</NUMEX>,
            reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX>-maximum at a diameter of about 1000
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼m</ENAMEX>, and thence tapers slowly to a low constant level
            within a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> Î¼m diameter region. We thus chose to
            bracket the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 to 600 Î</NUMEX>¼m <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximum range with a
            central disc of diameter <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">375 Î¼m</NUMEX> and an annulus of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">diameter 700 Î¼m.</ENAMEX> We chose the next annulus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> Î¼m
            diameter to match the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX>-maximum density range,
            followed by a final annulus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1250</TIMEX> Î¼m, after which the
            effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX> appeared to be essentially
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>. The correction percentages to be used in
            these regions were determined empirically by testing on
            images from several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with clinically apparent
            luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>. We looked at the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> of these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">images</ENAMEX> (standardized as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) and applied
            tapering percentage brightenings to them in the regions
            chosen above. We found that percentage increases in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> scale value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 and 1.0 percent</NUMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> over the inner disc and three outer annuli of
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diameters 375, 700, 1000 and 1250</TIMEX> Î¼m, respectively,
            provided essentially complete pattern corrections for
            some images, partial corrections for some images, but
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overcorrections</ENAMEX> (pattern reversal) in none. We
            therefore chose to fix these percentages and regions as
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> (unlikely to overcorrect) luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
            correction if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX> was present. The option to
            scale these percentages up or down in a given image was
            still available, but we chose not to exercise this
            option in the present study.
            The resulting correction in any cross-section
            through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was thus a series of step functions,
            which <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly approximated</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution A
            smoother approximation could have been achieved outside
            Photoshop, but the visual results of the current scheme
            were smooth to human observation.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the semi-automated method was
            therefore to apply the above correction to the green
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> of the standardized image if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX> was
            present. We then proceeded directly to the next step,
            interactive background leveling.
          
          
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Semi-automated method: interactive
            background leveling
            Each iteration in this step is an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
            correction, as will be described. This step was applied
            to the entire macular area, including the central
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">luteal</ENAMEX> area. Hence, if the multiplicative Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> did
            not entirely level the background centrally, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leveling</ENAMEX> was completed additively in Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
            Since we were dealing with photography, not
            photometry, the choice of multiplicative or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
            correction attempted to preserve semi-quantitative
            relationships of reflectance rather than absolute
            levels or precise numerical relationships [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
            Further, since reflectance variability was at issue,
            rather than absolute levels, we considered only the
            most variable components: the macular luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>,
            dealt with above, the nerve fiber layer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ]
            , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The RPE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denser</ENAMEX> in the fovea, and as such will reduce the
            reflectance of underlying drusen in much the same
            manner as the luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>. However, the change in
            density from central to eccentric locations is not
            nearly so marked as that of the luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>, and we
            did not include any further correction for this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorber</ENAMEX>.
            In the case of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL),
            we relied on the quantitative measurements of its
            spectral reflectance by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knighton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The highest
            spectral reflectance is for blue light (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">460 nm</NUMEX>),
            dropping off to perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/3</NUMEX> of this for green (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">510 nm</NUMEX>).
            The reflectance spectrum has essentially the same shape
            at varying points along an arcuate nerve fiber bundle,
            but decreases almost linearly in magnitude with
            distance from the disc. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> noted that this
            parallels the decline in thickness seen histologically
            [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] , and hypothesized that the reflectance
            spectrum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNFL</ENAMEX> is proportional to its thickness.
            This hypothesis applied to the macular area implies
            that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNFL</ENAMEX> reflectance will be minimum centrally and
            will increase with its thickness to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, which
            agrees with clinical observation and with our
            measurements of normal macular reflectance patterns [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . Also, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNFL</ENAMEX> is transparent, with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> for visible light [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
            ] , its reflectance essentially adds to the apparent
            reflectance of underlying structures. This holds
            because if r 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and r 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> are the reflectances of the RNFL
            and the subjacent structures, respectively, and t 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the transmission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNFL</ENAMEX>,
            then the net reflectance of the retina (both layers
            combined) will be:
            r 
            R = t 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 2r 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> + r 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
            In this case t 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is nearly unity, hence RNFL
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reflectance</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> to underlying structures such
            as drusen. For this reason, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> correction was
            chosen to complete the background leveling.
            The interactive steps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> correction
            proceed as follows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is presented with a
            pseudo-color topographic map, which highlights those
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> in the image whose background lies between the
            foveal minimum and the higher levels toward the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arcades</ENAMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is presented in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> scale. The color green is the pseudo-color
            representing those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pixels</ENAMEX> whose value is within a given
            range of the foveal minimum, i.e., the lowest
            background <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> then draws on a graphic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tablet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intuos, Wacom Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>) an ellipse
            chosen to be just large enough to enclose the
            background of the given pseudo-color (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>, magenta
            ellipse surrounding the green areas of low background).
            Non-background dark <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>, retinal
            vessels) are ignored. The gray scale value of each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pixel</ENAMEX> in the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (background, drusen and
            all else) within the ellipse is then raised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
            and the process repeated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B,1C</ENAMEX>). Since each step
            is deliberately chosen to be only a partial correction,
            several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iterations</ENAMEX> are performed on the resulting image
            until there are no more background <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> below this
            threshold. This partial correction per step was chosen
            as a reasonable way to force a smoother result, since
            each iteration uses a new set of ovals with boundary
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discontinuities</ENAMEX> limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. In our
            experience, these are indiscernible in the final
            result. A higher range of background is then tested,
            and again the background areas beneath this minimum are
            step-wise increased. The process terminates when all
            background has been increased to the higher levels at
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, which are the highest macular background
            levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Semi-automated method: choice of
            threshold
            After background leveling, the optimum threshold
            level for drusen segmentation in the selected subfield
            is chosen by flicker comparison with the
            contrast-enhanced image, as follows. For a given
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX>, the drusen image is segmented such that
            pixels with brightness intensities above the threshold
            are colored green, to label as drusen, and the rest
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">darkened</ENAMEX>. Each such drusen image is superimposed on the
            contrast-enhanced image. The optimized threshold is
            selected by visually inspecting the correspondence of
            the boundaries of the segmented drusen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> to those
            of the contrast-enhanced objects. The threshold is then
            adjusted so that this visual fit is optimum in the
            aggregate as judged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. The total drusen area
            as a percentage of the selected subfield is then read
            directly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photoshop/Histogram</ENAMEX>).
          
        
        
          Method reproducibility and validation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drusen</ENAMEX> area in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> digital images was
          measured in both the central and middle subfields by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JKC</ENAMEX>) using the
          semi-automated method. Means and standard deviations were
          calculated. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grader</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTS</ENAMEX>) also regraded the
          images in random order <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks later</TIMEX>, and the means
          and standard deviations of his gradings were calculated.
          An experienced retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCWK</ENAMEX>) graded
          the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stereo slide pairs independently,
          estimating drusen areas as a percent of the central and
          middle subfields in categories of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 to 25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX>, as specified by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification System</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This method
          of stereo pair grading is known to and accepted by
          clinicians as the "gold standard" for quantification of
          macular pathology. Another experienced retinal specialist
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IB</ENAMEX>) also graded the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stereo
          slide pairs independently, but was asked to further
          refine her gold standard estimates of drusen areas as a
          percent of the central and middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfields</ENAMEX> to the
          closest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. For example, if she first estimated drusen
          area to fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 10 and 25%</NUMEX>, then she was asked to
          assign an estimate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 15, 20</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>. For areas less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, an attempt was made to grade to the nearest
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        As proof of principle, we first demonstrated that the
        interactive procedure was effective in eliminating the
        concentric shading pattern in both a normal image (Figure
        2A,2B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) and a drusen-containing image (Figure
        2E,2F<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). Line scans through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">images</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C,2</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) show the leveling of the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">valleys</ENAMEX> in reflectance present in the originals.
        Since the technique raised the brightness of associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drusen</ENAMEX> along with the background, it provided a closer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> to the underlying or true reflectance of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drusen</ENAMEX>. It was then possible to apply uniform thresholds in
        the central and middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfields</ENAMEX> to define drusen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundaries</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,2C</ENAMEX>), and to create a binary image
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>) for further morphometric analysis.
        Another application of this method to a drusen image is
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 4</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> frame is the standardized color
        image, which then was contrast-enhanced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Photoshop</ENAMEX> for
        ease of drusen visualization (middle frame). The last frame
        is the final drusen segmentation after leveling the macular
        background. As in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 3</ENAMEX>, minor errors are present, but no
        significant bias between quadrants or between central and
        middle subfields is observed. We found similar scattered
        errors in all images tested, but overall good qualitative
        agreement with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX>.
        Testing of the digital method showed good inter-observer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent measurements of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfields</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subfields each from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> images). The means of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measurements had standard deviations ranging from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2% to 21.4%</NUMEX>. Despite the large outlier, these standard
        deviations were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> cases, and the
        median was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9%</NUMEX>. This reproducibility compared favorably
        with that of standard methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large
        deviation in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subfield</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Patient 6</ENAMEX> (see Bar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graph</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>). In this case, the photograph was of
        borderline quality due to cataract, and a large pale area
        within the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subfield</ENAMEX> was digitally segmented as
        drusen by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> (JKC) and left out by the other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTS</ENAMEX>). The clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX> were also divided in
        their opinions as to whether this lesion was a druse or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> (RPE) hypopigmentation.
        Intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> reproducibility of the digital method was
        tested by means of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> temporally separated measurements by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>. The mean measurements had a median standard
        deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8%</NUMEX> (range, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0% to 4.4%</NUMEX>). These standard
        deviations were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> cases. Overall,
        agreement was slightly better than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inter-observer</ENAMEX>
        measurements, but not in every case. On review,
        intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer disagreements</ENAMEX> appeared to be more due to the
        subjective choice of threshold for final segmentation
        rather than to disparities in the final background-leveled
        image to which the threshold was applied.
        For method validation, we then compared the results of
        the semi-automated digital method (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        slides) with the clinically accepted gold standard of
        expert stereo gradings of the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        corresponding stereo pairs of slides. Comparison of the
        mean digital area measurements to the categories obtained
        by stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 1</ENAMEX>, who used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classification</ENAMEX>, showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92 %</NUMEX> agreement (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22/24</NUMEX> digital
        measurements fell into the range in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
        Classification chosen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grader 1</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disagreements
        were both in the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfield</ENAMEX> (digital measurement <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Grader 1</ENAMEX> category <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX>; digital <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grader I</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 to 25%</NUMEX>).
        The mean digital area measurements were then compared to
        the more precise estimates of stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 2</ENAMEX> (Bar graphs,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5and</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1.xls</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> limits of agreement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        ] between the mean digital area measurements and this
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of stereo gradings were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-6.4 % to +6.8 %</NUMEX> in the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subfield</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-6.0 % to +4.5 %</NUMEX> in the middle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfield</ENAMEX>. The mean absolute differences between the digital
        and stereo gradings were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 %</NUMEX> in the central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfield</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX> in the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfield</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison with stereo grader 2 thus showed excellent
        agreement overall, with better agreement in the middle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfield</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> micron diameter annulus) than in the central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfield</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> micron diameter circle), as evidenced by the
        smaller absolute differences. The reason was that inclusion
        or exclusion of any single lesion in the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> had
        a proportionally larger effect on the measurement. With the
        exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> measurement in the central subfield
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 11</ENAMEX>), the mean digital measurements were all within
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of those of stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 2</ENAMEX> (see Bar graph, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5C</ENAMEX>). The
        measurements were often closer for those images with scanty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drusen</ENAMEX> (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grader 2</ENAMEX> made estimates to within
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, but these findings were not statistically
        significant.
        The above examples with larger errors illustrate the
        important point that both our method and the current
        standard of manual stereo grading are subjective, and
        occasional large disagreements may occur with either
        method. In our method, the subjective steps include:
        whether or not to make a luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> correction; the
        exact placement of the ovals at each step of the
        interactive procedure; and the final choice of threshold
        for segmentation in each subfield. The manual stereo
        grading method is entirely subjective. Furthermore, while
        our procedure is logically based on a semi-quantitative
        geometric study of macular reflectance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , there are
        photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nonlinearities</ENAMEX> in each step that are
        incorporated only qualitatively. Hence, the procedure
        itself can be evaluated quantitatively only as to the
        validity of its outcome in comparison to the subjective
        current standard of stereo slide viewing at a light
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX>
        A limitation of the present method is that introduction
        of substantial other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologies</ENAMEX> besides drusen might
        confound our techniques, whereas a trained human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>
        makes such distinctions quickly. For example, areas of RPE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypopigmentation</ENAMEX> or frank geographic atrophy with higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reflectance</ENAMEX> in the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> could be included in the
        drusen threshold. These would have to be removed manually
        or by additional software relying on other features. Image
        quality can also make the differentiation of drusen and RPE
        abnormalities difficult by any method. Another source of
        variability not encountered in this study of Caucasians
        could include racial pigmentation. However, we had found
        that the macular reflectance patterns in standardized
        images from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from other races were the same
        as those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Hence no new difficulty
        would be anticipated in drusen segmentation in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of possible error in the automated method
        are as follows: the leveling of the macular background is
        an approximation that may make a given section too bright
        or too dim by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of gray scale. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drusen</ENAMEX> in such an
        area would be over or under-represented accordingly.
        Likewise, variation in the placement of the ovals in the
        interactive steps would lead to local irregular variability
        in the final leveled image. This latter error, however,
        tended not to be cumulative since the iterative process is
        to some extent self-correcting. That is, if a dark region
        of pixels were missed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> oval for brightening, they
        would still be "too dark" in the next iteration and should
        be picked up there. Hence, errors of this kind in the final
        result tend to be limited to that of a single iteration
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gray scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>). In practice, a) errors of opposing
        signs in different sections will tend to cancel out around
        the mean error, and b) the mean error will tend towards
        zero when the optimum threshold is chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to
        give the best subjective segmentation overall (i.e., if the
        image on average is too bright, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> will tend to use a
        higher threshold). This probably explains why our
        semi-automated results give close agreement in total area
        to the gold standard estimates. However, there may still be
        sections of an image in which the semi-automated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">segmentation</ENAMEX> is incorrect by wider margins. This means that
        if it is important to have the greatest precision in a
        particular subregion other than the standard subfields, a
        specific threshold for this region should be chosen
        separately. As noted above, however, we did not find any
        systematic errors of segmentation with respect to quadrants
        or subregions.
        The luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> correction, which was determined
        empirically, could similarly affect central macular drusen
        segmentation. Luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> density of course varies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> and distribution between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, especially in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMD</ENAMEX>, and in this study we allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> options: apply
        the fixed correction in a given image, or not. As noted in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>, we used data on several normal subjects to aim
        deliberately for under-correction in this step, hence
        maintaining reflectance pattern concentricity. Further
        corrections could then be applied in the next steps,
        iterative background leveling. As it happened in this
        study, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> thought that luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> was
        present and thus applied the fixed correction in every
        case. As noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>, however, this correction is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scalable</ENAMEX>. By the same reasoning as above, if it were
        desired to have the most precise segmentation of central
        macular drusen, the luteal correction scale could be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimized</ENAMEX>. Ideally, direct measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luteal pigment</ENAMEX>
        density by an independent method could have been
        incorporated. We did not pursue this here since central
        subfield segmentation appeared adequate.
        The utility of a method is also a function of the human
        effort, i.e., time, required to evaluate a given image. The
        semi-automated method required, after training, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> time (negligible computer time) per
        slide to complete drusen segmentation. Manual placement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ellipses</ENAMEX> followed by subjective decisions regarding final
        threshold choice was the most time consuming. We estimated
        that full automation of the background-leveling steps
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with ellipse placements, etc. would reduce
        operator time to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes</TIMEX> in total. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Grader 2</ENAMEX>
        required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately ten minutes</TIMEX> for the more precise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gradings</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Grader 1</ENAMEX>, highly experienced,
        needed about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> to grade by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classification System</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Quantification of drusen is essential to the study of
        age related macular degeneration. Current techniques are
        relatively imprecise, subjective, and labor intensive. By
        applying our findings with respect to macular reflectance
        patterns we have developed a reproducible, validated
        semi-automated method for leveling the macular background
        and segmenting drusen by a uniform threshold. At the
        present level of automation, this method can give drusen
        measurements at a higher level of precision (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) than
        the widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification System</ENAMEX>, with a
        tradeoff of longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> time until background leveling
        can be fully automated. The choice of a final threshold is
        still subjective, but its global application enforces some
        degree of objectivity as well.
        Treating the macular background as a whole is a
        significant conceptual advance over previous methods, which
        rely on multiple local thresholds. Differentiation of
        drusen from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> hypopigmentation, however, is still a
        limitation for both our method and previous methods in
        dealing with more complex images. The main practical
        advantage to our technique is that in leveling the macular
        background, the same correction is smoothly and
        simultaneously applied to the drusen embedded within the
        image, with the dimmer central ones being brightened or
        enhanced. There is still intrinsic variability in terms of
        the true reflectance of drusen, but the variability in
        background reflectance is largely eliminated. The result is
        increased precision and objectivity in drusen
        measurement.
