        In the lexicon of genomics, an annotation is any feature
        tied to the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>, for example, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene model, a transposon, or a
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding RNA gene</ENAMEX>. Adding such annotations to the
        sequence of a genome in a rigorous and consistent way is a
        prerequisite for the efficient use of that sequence in
        biological research. Learning how to identify, display,
        query, and interpret genome features in well-characterized
        model organisms like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly, 
        Drosophila melanogaster , is crucial
        to understanding the genomes of more complex organisms,
        including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> .
        A major long-term goal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>] annotation
        project is to overlay the 
        Drosophila melanogaster genomic
        sequence with all available biological information and to
        provide traceable evidence for every annotation in a
        publicly accessible database. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we provide a
        description of our most recent step toward these goals.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>, a collaborative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celera</ENAMEX>
        Genomics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Projects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDGP</ENAMEX>), and a number of additional 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> published the
        annotated, nearly finished genomic sequence of the fruit
        fly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. This annotated sequence was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>,
        in anticipation of future changes to the sequence and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. At that time, the annotation of genes relied
        heavily on computational gene-prediction algorithms with
        only limited human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> provided
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80,000</NUMEX> expressed sequence tags (ESTs), mostly
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of genes, which were used in the
        computational analyses of the genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Because these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were derived from non-normalized cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and
        were limited in number, they corresponded to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 40%</NUMEX>
        of all genes in the genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Complete or nearly
        complete sequences for an overlapping set of approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> known 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX>
        were also available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Owing to the nature of
        whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> (WGS) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,630</NUMEX> gaps present
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> tended to occur at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of repetitive
        sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]; gaps corresponding to transposable elements
        were filled with composite sequences (reflecting sequence
        reads from throughout the genome) rather than the actual
        sequence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> predicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>,
        encoding 14,080 transcripts; each gene was assigned a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unique CG</ENAMEX> identifier. The coordinates and predicted
        sequences of the annotations, although not the evidence for
        the predictions, were made available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FlyBase</ENAMEX>, the public databases
        charged with making these annotations accessible to the
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX>, the annotations were made
        available as part of the genome annotation database, Gadfly
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, a collaborative effort between Celera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX>, was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 330</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> sequence had been filled. Changes to
        the annotations were based largely on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6,000</NUMEX>
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> sequenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX>, which increased the
        number of genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> and allowed further refinement
        in gene structures. Sequences of transposable elements
        remained inaccurate, being based on composite sequences. In
        all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">748</NUMEX> transcripts were modified, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> transcripts were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deleted</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX> transcripts were added. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Release 2</ENAMEX>
        predicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,474</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>, encoding 14,335
        polypeptides, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,218</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>) were unchanged relative
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>. Thus, the change from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
        was minimal.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inaccuracies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> predicted gene
        structures resulted mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">computationally</ENAMEX> predicted
        annotations which lacked supporting cDNA data. In addition,
        the annotation was carried out rapidly by a large and
        diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX>. Mistakes in the annotation of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> in error
        reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000</NUMEX> discrepancies
        between the translated annotations and those in the curated
        protein database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] were reported by Karlin 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Finally, a report of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,042</NUMEX> new predicted annotations that did not match any of
        the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> predicted genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], and another
        based on analysis of testes cDNA sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], suggested
        that the initial annotation may have missed a substantial
        number of genes.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">116.8 megabase</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>)
        euchromatic genomic sequence has now been finished to high
        quality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Here we report the results of the
        re-evaluation of previous annotations in light of the
        finished euchromatic genome and considerable additional
        experimental data. We call this sequence and new annotation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">set Release 3</ENAMEX>.
        To support this re-annotation effort, a computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'pipeline</ENAMEX>' was created, and the results were stored in a
        new Gadfly database, so that evidence for the annotations
        can be tracked and queried by the public [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. To identify
        new features in the genome, we utilized prediction software
        and annotated alignments of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and pseudogenes. To improve the extent
        and consistency of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curation</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of expert
        FlyBase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> visually inspected each gene in the entire
        euchromatic sequence, using defined rules to integrate
        computational analyses, cDNA data and protein alignments
        into updated annotations. To assess the accuracy of the
        exon-intron structures, we compared the resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> to the subset of curated peptides in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX>-PROT
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> that are based on experimental evidence [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>].
        The annotations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> alter the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>) of
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, yet confirm that previous releases accurately
        reflected the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>. The gene
        models have been enhanced in a number of ways. The number
        of genes with annotated untranslated regions (UTRs) and
        alternative transcripts has increased as a direct result of
        the increase in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and complete cDNA sequences, and the
        fine details of the exon-intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are significantly
        improved. Numerous genes have been merged and/or split -
        that is, the partitioning of adjacent exons into individual
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> has changed - based on cDNA and protein
        sequence alignments. Overall, the improved annotations
        result in changes in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40%</NUMEX> of the predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>; however, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 85%</NUMEX> of the exons in the
        originally predicted genes contain sequences that are
        present in predicted exons in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. We describe these
        changes under the headings 'Genome statistics: how is
        Release <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different?', 'New and deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX>', and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Structural</ENAMEX> changes to gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>' in Results and
        discussion.
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> reveal a surprising number of genes
        that fall outside the typical definition of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene model with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, coding sequence
        (CDS), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> distinct from neighboring genes. We found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences that overlap the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' UTR
        of the gene immediately downstream, examples of dicistronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> distinct and non-overlapping
        coding regions contained on a single processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX>), and
        genes that, by means of alternative splicing, encode two
        completely distinct non-overlapping peptides. These
        atypical gene models illustrate the complexity of detailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> and pose new challenges for the computational
        annotation of genomic sequence. We describe these unusual
        genes, as well as assessment of and access to the data,
        under the headings 'Complex gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>', 'Assessment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> quality', 'Accessing data and reporting errors',
        and 'Future updates'.

            Increase in the number of exons and transcripts,
            but not genes
            Although the re-annotation process changed the
            majority of gene models, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
            genes changed minimally, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>
            to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,474</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,676</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, of
            which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,379</NUMEX> are in the euchromatin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX>
            in the heterochromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            gene structures have changed to contain more exons. The
            total number of unique exons in euchromatin, defined as
            having unique sequence coordinate termini, has
            increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54,793</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,897</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> has increased as well, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,667 to 54,934</NUMEX> (we
            define a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding exon here as any exon
            containing CDS, even if the majority of the exon is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>). The consequence is that the average number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> per gene has increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, which is very similar to 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]) and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]) but
            significantly lower than 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.9</NUMEX>, see, for example
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]).
            A major contributor to the increase in exons is the
            increase in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">identified 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. One limitation of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction
            programs is that they predict only open reading frames
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>): <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and full-length cDNA data are absolutely
            essential to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. The expanded set of
            available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data led to a significant increase
            in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotated genes</ENAMEX> and transcripts with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> of the genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> of the genes in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3; Table 1</ENAMEX>). These numbers
            reflect data availability: sequences from cDNA clones
            representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> transcript from approximately
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> of the genes in 
            Drosophila were supplemented by a
            large number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">additional 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. The
            length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> also increased with these new data
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>): the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' UTR length per transcript
            (for genes with annotated UTRs) increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, to
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">265</NUMEX> nucleotides, and the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' UTR length (for
            genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>) by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">442</NUMEX> nucleotides.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> times as many genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) as
            compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) show alternative transcripts
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The vast majority of these are due to
            alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> (an introduced bias; see Materials
            and methods), but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> are due to alternative promoters
            and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> to alternative polyadenylation sites.
            Alternative splicing results in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> increase in the
            number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding transcripts, and is largely
            responsible for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> increase in the number of unique
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">protein species</ENAMEX>: from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13,922</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,848</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Release 3</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-five percent</NUMEX> of predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> differ
            from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            The changes in gene models also result in larger
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> have a mean length of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">552</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">421</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This
            is an increase compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, where the mean
            was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">503</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and the median 385 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The
            longest transcript and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are encoded by 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dumpy</ENAMEX> (dp) , which encodes a
            massive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">69.7 kilobase</NUMEX> (kb) mRNA and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,054</NUMEX> amino-acid
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is a component of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, and appears to serve as an
            elastic adhesion molecule at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cuticle</NUMEX>-cell junctions,
            such as the epidermalcuticle interface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
            The vast majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations

            Transposable elements
            The sequences of the vast majority of transposons in
            Releases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">composites</ENAMEX> derived from a number
            of copies of that transposon type. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, these
            composite sequences are replaced with the actual

            transposons, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> foldback (FB) elements. These data
            include both full-length and partial elements. Details
            of these analyses are reported in an accompanying
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article [ 18</ENAMEX>].
          
          
            Non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding RNA genes</ENAMEX>
            Small, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding RNAs are also included in
            this re-annotation. We searched for new tRNA genes
            using the program tRNAscan<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-SE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sim4</ENAMEX> alignments
            to known tRNAs: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> are annotated in the euchromatin
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tRNA
            genes were deleted as a result of sequence finishing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resolving</ENAMEX> repeated regions of the genome.
            Other non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding RNAs are limited, in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, to those already curated in the FlyBase
            database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of the known microRNAs in 
            Drosophila are located precisely
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX>. We annotated the majority of
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> small nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (snRNAs) involved in
            splicing, with the exception of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> snRNAs, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K2a</TIMEX>,
            K2b, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K8</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], for which there were no sequence
            or cytological data available. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> snRNAs
            supported by such data, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundant</ENAMEX> entries, and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> could not be
            identified at the previously specified cytological
            locations, possibly due to strain variation and/or
            inaccuracy in previous localization experiments. Thus,
            we precisely located by sequence alignment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> snRNAs in
            the genome, including a new copy of the 
            snRNA:U4atac gene in the 83A
            region.
            All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleolar RNA</ENAMEX> (snoRNA) genes
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX> were identified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sim4</TIMEX> alignment of
            sequence obtained from the literature. In addition, we
            incorporated data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tycowski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steitz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] and
            located <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> more snoRNAs. Identification of other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snoRNAs</ENAMEX> should be possible in the future with the use
            of algorithms like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snoscan</ENAMEX>, which looks for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-ribose
            methylation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide snoRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]; however, the program
            will have to be customized for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
            The longer non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding RNA genes</ENAMEX> αγ-

            iab-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , are annotated in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> new 'miscellaneous non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>' genes
            were detected by alignment of spliced DGC cDNAs that
            did not appear to contain an ORF of significant length.
            In some cases these appear to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> antisense
            genes, which have also been reported in other organisms
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Further experiments will be necessary to verify
            the existence of these interesting genes and to
            determine their function.
          
          
            Pseudogenes
            The number of pseudogenes reported in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> is substantially
            smaller than that in 
            Caenorhabditis elegans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>].
            We annotated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pseudogenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX> that map to
            the euchromatic sequence and correspond to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding paralogs</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> in
            the additional data files). We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> new
            pseudogenes: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> histones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lectin ( 
            CR31541 ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> pseudogenes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> are recombinationally
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">derived</ENAMEX> (with introns, in tandem to their functional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ( 
            Mgstl-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Psi</ENAMEX> ) is retrotransposed
            (with a poly(A) tail, lacking introns which its
            functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralog</ENAMEX> possesses), and one is too
            degenerate to classify definitively. We did not make
            any attempt to comprehensively survey for new
            retrotransposed pseudogenes or annotate pseudogenes
            identified by Echols 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WormBase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>]
            currently reports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">392</NUMEX> pseudogenes in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . It is very likely
            that a subset of the genes identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
            genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> are actually pseudogenes. In
            particular, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> were noted as
            containing a 'probable mutation in the sequenced
            strain' and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400</NUMEX> were marked 'problematic'
            because of inconsistencies with the experimental
            evidence and the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> contains a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">802</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
            genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), that is, gene models that show no
            overlap with exons in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. Of these, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) are
            based solely on gene-prediction data, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of these
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> are based on GENSCAN predictions alone. Unlike
            Releases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>, which relied heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>],
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations did utilize GENSCAN predictions
            (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> exon with a score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 45</NUMEX>) in the
            absence of other data. The majority of the new genes
            show matches to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">573</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) or full-insert cDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>), indicating the importance of
            these alignments in identifying new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> missed by the
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction
            programs. An additional set of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was identified
            by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in error reports (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) or in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> submissions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). Finally, we
            created 338 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) new annotations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homology data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> analysis, arising
            from the comparison of translated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence
            with sequence of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> or other model
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, in the absence of other supporting data.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence 'finishing' had the largest
            impact on areas of repetitive sequence, because the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> WGS sequence assembly often collapsed these
            regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Duplicated sequences present assembly
            challenges to genome sequencing efforts; tandemly
            duplicated genes tend to collapse in sequence assembly
            and cannot be annotated until the duplications are
            resolved. Whole-genome analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> suggested that 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has fewer newly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicated genes</ENAMEX> than nematodes or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. We
            investigated whether sequence finishing might have
            uncovered previously undiscovered duplicated genes in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . From this analysis,
            we found that the number of newly duplicated genes is
            more similar to 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
            Saccharomyces cerevisiae than
            previously believed.
            We measured the frequency of newly annotated
            duplicated genes by comparing each of the transcripts
            encoded by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">802</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> to all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> transcripts using the BLASTN program. Of the
            new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) have duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>
            identity, probability = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> × e <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-25</NUMEX>) somewhere in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> (whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of a random sample of 
            Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have duplicates
            by this measure). Thirty-six new genes are in repeat
            regions that were collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and have now
            been resolved. For example, in the previously annotated
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene trypsin cluster on chromosome arm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>, three
            new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin genes</ENAMEX> ( 
            CG30025, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG30028</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG30031</TIMEX> ) have
            been added ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Deleted protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes
            We rejected a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">345 Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> during
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> re-annotation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), primarily on the
            basis of a lack of supporting computational or
            experimental evidence (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were deleted because they were
            contained within transposable elements. If based solely
            on computational gene-prediction evidence, genes that
            were less than an arbitrary length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
            were deleted. We required an arbitrary length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for all annotations not specifically
            supported by literature references (for example, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DIRG genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> of the deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            annotations were removed because they failed to meet
            this criterion (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, inset).
            The sizes of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> were compared (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>),
            along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotations
            deleted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, and sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> newly added
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). When examining the size range
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-50 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, there is a marked decrease in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, due to the
            more stringent data requirements for small annotations
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>, inset).
          
        
        
          Structural changes to gene models
          
            Gene merges
            Evidence supporting the merger of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> came
            mainly from the alignment of full-length cDNA sequences
            and, to a lesser extent, from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homology
            evidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merges</ENAMEX> based solely on BLASTX similarity were
            more difficult, as the exact exon-intron structure of
            the merged model was not experimentally indicated. A
            total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,351</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were merged to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">602</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of total) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genes. Sometimes the original
            predictions were spaced quite far apart in the genome,
            a probable reason that the gene prediction algorithm(s)
            separated the exons. For example, multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> support
            a merge of 
            CG14409 and the 
            Flotillin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> ( 
            Flo-2 or 
            CG11547 ), adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exons
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 80</NUMEX> kb away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotation of the 
            Flo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The new 
            Flo-2 transcript encodes a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 50</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at its amino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Gene splits
            Gene model splits were often necessitated by the
            facts that gene-prediction programs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> can string together genes that lie close to
            each other and do not resolve nested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Of the
            Release <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">322</NUMEX> were split to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">675</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of
            total) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genes. For example, the annotated gene
            
            CG6645 , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> exons in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), appears to have been based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX> (note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> had predicted two
            separate genes). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> homology to
            other fly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> indicated that this gene should be
            split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX>-exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
            CG32054 and 
            CG32053 . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One 5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exon and one
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding exon in 
            CG32053 were missed by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX>. Thus, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> correctly
            predicted the structure of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; each
            correctly predicted aspects of the gene models, but <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> data were necessary to accurately determine
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Gene splits/merges
            Gene splits/merges were defined as changes involving
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. While not
            common, splits/merges are interesting in that they
            involve simultaneous restructuring of multiple Release
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 annotations.</TIMEX> One notable example is the split of 
            CG8278 into the 
            CG30350 and 
            sns annotations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In
            this instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX>, and cDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of 
            CG8278 should be split off as a
            separate gene model ( 
            CG30350 ), while the
            GenBank:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AF254867</NUMEX> record indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon of 
            CG8278 plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> should be merged into the extensive 
            sns annotation. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>
            cases in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotations suffered a
            reassignment of exons more complex than a simple gene
            split or merge to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          Complex gene models
          
            Nested genes
            The phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within genes, in which a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is included within the intron of another gene, is
            common. In the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.9 Mb</ENAMEX> 
            Adh region of 
            Drosophila , the frequency of
            nested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 7%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
            In extending this analysis to the entire euchromatin,
            we find that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,038</NUMEX>) of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genes,
            including non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, are included within the
            introns of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">879</NUMEX> nested
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>, the majority (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">574</ENAMEX>) are
            transcribed from the opposite strand of the including
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. We observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> cases in which the exons and
            introns of a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> are interleaved. Transposons may
            also be located within the introns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; we
            observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">431</NUMEX> such cases.
          
          
            Overlapping genes
            We analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> predicted for neighboring
            genes to find those transcripts that share common
            non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding genomic sequence. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 15%</NUMEX> of
            annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,054</NUMEX>) involve the overlap of mRNAs on
            opposite strands. Some of these involve overlapping
            messages that have been previously described (for
            example, 
            Dopa decarboxylase and 
            CG10561 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]); however, the vast
            majority were not previously known to overlap.
            Complementary sequences between distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> from
            overlapping genes on opposite strands have previously
            been reported in eukaryotes and have been implicated in
            regulating gene expression (for reviews see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]).
            For example, the complementary sequence shared between 
            Dopa decarboxylase and 
            CG10561 is thought to be involved
            in regulating the levels of these transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
            The large number of such overlapping transcripts
            identified here raises the possibility that antisense
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> may not be an uncommon mechanism for
            regulating gene expression in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
            We were surprised to find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 60</NUMEX> cases of
            overlapping genes on the same strand, for which
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cDNA/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of the upstream
            gene overlaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of the downstream gene. In
            some instances, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of the upstream gene extends
            past the postulated translation start of the downstream
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of such an overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is 
            CG9455 and 
            Spn1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CG9456</NUMEX>) , tandem genes
            encoding serine protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are individually supported by a variety of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> data as well as full-insert cDNA sequences.
            Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA clone
            covering the 
            Spn1 gene (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT24862</NUMEX>) is entirely
            included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-most exon of the 
            CG9455 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA clone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GH04125</NUMEX>).
            The existence of overlapping genes raises many
            questions. Are such pairs of genes typically
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated? Where are the transcriptional regulatory
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>? What are the
            structural constraints on the overlapping
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>?
          
          
            Alternatively transcribed genes
            One mechanism for increasing potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
            regulatory diversity is through the production of
            alternative transcripts. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 20%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            genes have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> predicted transcript, and this
            is almost certainly an underestimate. Many instances of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> alternative splicing as well as alternative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyadenylation</ENAMEX> will have been missed, as our dataset
            of cDNA sequences contained many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> than 3'
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> or complete cDNAs. As cDNA collections are
            expanded, including those representing specific stages,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, and cell types, additional genes with multiple
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> and additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein species</ENAMEX> produced by
            alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> will undoubtedly be identified.
            Despite likely underestimation, the level of
            alternative splicing that was observed clearly
            illustrates that alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> is an important
            mechanism for generating transcript diversity in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (see Supplementary
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> in the additional data files).
            Alternative splicing creates opportunities for
            diversity both at the level of gene regulation and of
            protein diversity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,729</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            encoding multiple transcripts generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> protein
            product; the transcripts differ only in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>.
            Very commonly, these alternative transcripts vary in
            the location of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' non-coding exons, suggesting the use
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternative promoters</ENAMEX> and offering the possibility
            of differential regulation. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The other 65%</NUMEX> of genes with
            alternative transcripts encode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more protein
            products, indicating that alternative splicing
            generates considerable protein diversity in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
            A large number of related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be produced
            from a single gene by the simple substitution of a
            single domain. This mechanism has been taken to an
            extreme level in the case of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mod</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mdg4</NUMEX>) , which produces at
            least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> distinct transcripts that share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' exons, but
            are alternatively spliced to an array of different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of these transcripts
            appear to be generated by a 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -splicing mechanism, using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">variable 3</ENAMEX>' exons encoded on the opposite strand.
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -spliced variants were
            previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>]; our analysis suggests
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>.) Although we did not find any further examples
            of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans -splicing</ENAMEX>, we did find that
            a similar gene, 
            lola , generates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 21</NUMEX>
            alternative transcripts (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> previously
            described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]). The many 
            lola transcripts also share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
            exons, but contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of an array of different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX>. Both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lola</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mod</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mdg4</NUMEX>) encode <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of
            specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> transcription factors that
            include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTB/POZ</ENAMEX> dimerization domain near each amino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>]. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mod</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mdg4</NUMEX>) has been implicated in
            a range of cellular and developmental processes,
            including chromatin insulator functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>], and it has been suggested that its
            many different isoforms underlie the pleiotropic nature
            of this gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
            Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> can produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or more)
            distinct non-overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> from a single
            pre-mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>; we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> such cases (for
            example, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanaso</ENAMEX> and α- 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spec</ENAMEX> , see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The mRNAs
            produced most commonly share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences, but may
            also share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> defines complexes
            of this type as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate genes, since two
            non-overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> are produced. Although
            other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> sometimes describe such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dicistronic</ENAMEX> (since the unprocessed transcript is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dicistronic</ENAMEX>), we do not include this type in our
            categorization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dicistronic genes</ENAMEX> (see below). The
            component coding regions are resolved on separate
            mRNAs, and thus internal translation initiation is not
            required. We view these cases as one extreme along a
            continuum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> diversity created by alternative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Dicistronic genes
            Examples of dicistronic transcripts have been
            previously reported in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55, 56, 57, 58</TIMEX>,
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 60, 61</TIMEX>]. Our results confirm that, while not
            common, numerous examples of apparent dicistronic
            transcripts are encountered in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . We limit the term
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'dicistronic</ENAMEX>' to genes that meet the following
            criteria: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct and non-overlapping coding
            regions contained on a single processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX>, requiring
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> initiation of translation of the downstream
            CDS. In order to categorize a transcript as
            dicistronic, we required that each CDS exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> amino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length and show some similarity to known
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotation contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> gene
            pairs that can be described as dicistronic by these
            criteria (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, and see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> in
            additional data files). This includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> cases for
            which the dicistronic transcript is represented by a
            single cDNA. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> additional pairs, denoted as
            putative, for which there is insufficient BLASTX
            evidence to support both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in a dicistronic gene
            model (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Since the
            determination of genes as dicistronic requires multiple
            classes of data to confirm the transcript structure and
            validate the coding regions, there are undoubtedly
            additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dicistronic genes</ENAMEX> yet to be uncovered
            throughout the genome.
            For many of the predicted dicistronic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31/48</NUMEX>),
            there is evidence supporting alternative monocistronic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>(s) for either the upstream or downstream
            CDS, or for both. This includes 
            Mosc1A+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Mosc1B</NUMEX> , for which the
            monocistronic transcript encodes a fusion protein
            encompassing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. In some cases the
            dicistronic form may be less prevalent than the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocistronic</ENAMEX> forms: it has been estimated that the
            dicistronic 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adh</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adhr</ENAMEX> transcript is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> as
            abundant as that of the 
            Adh monocistronic transcripts [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>].
            Translation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CDS of a dicistronic
            transcript requires that initiation of translation
            occur at an internal site. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proposed
            mechanisms for the initiation of internal translation.
            One mechanism is that internal initiation occurs by
            partial disassembly of the ribosome at the termination
            of translation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CDS, followed by continued
            scanning by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">40S ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. The
            following conditions are thought to be criteria for the
            ribosomal scanning mechanism: an absence of any ATG
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> in the intercistronic region, an intercistronic
            region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 to 78</NUMEX> bp, and an optimized consensus
            translation start site for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CDS. We assessed
            the sizes of intercistronic regions and the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATGs</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, and found that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
            pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dicistronic genes</ENAMEX> that appear to conform to
            this pattern (indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The
            majority of dicistronic cases clearly do not conform to
            such a model of partial ribosome disassembly and
            continued scanning. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases, the intercistronic
            region is less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 bp</TIMEX>. However, most of the
            annotated dicistronic pairs are separated by several
            hundred base pairs, and the separation can be as much
            as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> kb. In these longer intercistronic regions,
            there may be multiple ATG codons before the second
            translation start site. A mechanism of translation
            initiation utilizing an internal ribosome entry site
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRES</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>]) appears a better explanation for these
            cases. Oh 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>] have hypothesized
            that certain 
            Drosophila genes with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long 5</TIMEX>'
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> might be translated via internal ribosome entry.
            If this is the case, translation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CDS
            within a dicistronic transcript may be effected by the
            same initiation mechanism.
          
        
        
          Assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> quality
          
            Did we miss <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>?
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] suggested that the
            number of genes in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> might be a severe
            underestimate, based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,297</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">testes EST</TIMEX> sequences they
            generated and aligned to the annotated genome. However,
            using their data, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,087</NUMEX> additional
            testes-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], we predict a similar number
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> as in previous releases. The more
            likely explanation for their results is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exons,
            and not genes, were under-predicted in 
            Drosophila , since there is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
            evidence for testes-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and transcripts
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. In most cases, the testes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> did not align to
            Release <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> because only the downstream CDS had
            previously been annotated for those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, whereas in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> that match the testes ESTs are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX>.
            Gopal 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,042</NUMEX>
            novel genes that were not included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. After completing our re-annotation, we
            compared this set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,042</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to our data. We found
            that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of their predicted genes mapped to
            euchromatin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> mapped to heterochromatin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> mapped
            within transposable elements, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> could not be found
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genomic sequence. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> that
            mapped to euchromatin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">520</ENAMEX>) do match <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The remaining 34%</NUMEX> did not match <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            annotations, leading to the possibility that some or
            all of these may represent novel genes. Incorporating
            their methods (threading GENSCAN predictions to look
            for structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homology</ENAMEX>) into our computational
            approach may uncover additional missed genes.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to address the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> is by comparative sequence analysis. In an
            accompanying paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Bergman</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>] surveyed sequence
            conservation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome containing
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> using comparative data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 
            Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">willistoni</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis) . Their comparison
            to our 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster annotations
            detected no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> conserved in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that were
            missed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>].
            Other genes likely to be missed are genes with small
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> (because of the arbitrary length cutoffs we used,
            see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> during development, at very low levels,
            and/or in cells and tissues not represented by the DGC
            cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA clones will be
            generated by directed screening of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> with
            probes matching predicted exons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], and cDNAs
            selected during the re-annotation process to represent
            alternative transcripts not currently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> on gene prediction data versus cDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
            Of the final set of annotations, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> contain
            sequences that are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie-</ENAMEX>predicted exons and
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> contain sequences that are present in
            GENSCAN-predicted exons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 249</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were created without an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio model, that is, solely
            on the basis of cDNA or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homology evidence. The
            fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> of our accepted annotations span a region
            containing a gene prediction supports both the strength
            of the prediction programs' algorithms as well as our
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> on them for our methods. However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were often wrong in detail,
            when compared to cDNA sequence alignments for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
            main reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, exon mis-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>: the
            programs placed exons from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene with the exons of a
            neighboring or nested gene; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, erroneous splice
            site calls: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were slightly
            misplaced; or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, missed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX> and micro-exons:
            small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ORFs</ENAMEX> were not identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 66</TIMEX>].
            The fraction of gene models that are based solely on
            gene prediction data has decreased considerably, from
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,348</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">815</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This shift was primarily due to the more
            recently available 
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Drosophila EST</TIMEX> and cDNA
            sequences, rather than newly evident similarity to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
            Alignment of full-length cDNA sequences from the
            same strain continues to be the best way to annotate
            gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66, 67, 68</TIMEX>]. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> generated
            by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> project increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 86,000</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">246,248</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] and the number
            of sequenced full-insert cDNAs from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1,000</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 9,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. For
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 6,000</NUMEX> of these, the completely assembled
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was available during the re-annotation effort
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,699</NUMEX> ESTs
            from the community deposited in dbEST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>], including
            a set of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7,297</NUMEX> from a testes cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], were
            available. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> show
            a match to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> to
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-insert cDNA sequences. We anticipate further
            improvement to gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as more cDNA data become
            available.
          
          
            Non-consensus splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and small
            introns
            All introns within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> were
            examined for conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> splice junctions with the
            Sequin program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>], and all instances of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> splice junctions were
            inspected and commented on. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48,039</NUMEX> total splice
            junctions, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> are annotated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/AG</ENAMEX> splice
            junctions, a frequency that might justify describing GC
            as an alternative splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> instances of
            AT/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> splice junctions are annotated. An especially
            well supported example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT/AC</ENAMEX> usage is 
            CG1354 , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 25</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confirming ESTs</ENAMEX>. Other cases of non-consensus splice
            sites appear rare; however, more are likely to be
            documented in the future. The particular alignment
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> used (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) and our
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> upon gene-prediction data imposed a bias
            against unconventional splice sites. In a number of
            cases for which an unconventional splice junction was
            supported by cDNA data, the precise location of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">junction</ENAMEX> could not be determined, owing to repeated
            sequence at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor sites. A good
            example of this type of pattern is 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sba</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CG13598</NUMEX>) . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> alternative
            transcripts for this gene are supported by cDNA data,
            and both appear to contain an unconventional, ambiguous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">splice</ENAMEX> junction. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcripts share the
            unconventional splice acceptor site; they differ in the
            location of the non-consensus splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>, but
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> sites are identical in sequence.
            We also examined every gene model with an intron
            less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 bp</TIMEX>. The frequency of such introns in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> is low; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. There are several well
            supported examples of introns <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 45 bp</TIMEX>, with at
            least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> derived from the sequenced
            strain. These include 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mod</ENAMEX>(r) and 
            csul , each with an intron of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>, and 
            CG11892 , with a diminutive
            intron of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 bp</NUMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL</ENAMEX> validation of the models
            We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> databases
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEP-QC</ENAMEX> software program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] to validate
            the integrity of the annotations and to track
            consistency with previously published data (see
            Materials and methods). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,687</NUMEX> annotated peptides
            with a cognate in the curated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>/TrEMBL
            dataset, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,764</NUMEX>) were of identical length and had
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 99%</NUMEX> sequence identity. Curators examined each
            case with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 100%</NUMEX> sequence identity, and in some
            cases, annotation errors were detected and corrected.
            For example, translation start sites were shifted to
            the experimentally reported position, which in some
            cases was downstream of the predicted start. However,
            in most cases discrepancies appeared to be due to
            strain-specific polymorphisms or errors in the reported
            DNA sequence on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX> entries were based
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Given the high quality of
            the underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genomic sequence, we believe
            that in many cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> is more
            accurate than the sequences deposited by the community
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrEMBL</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gene models
            The amount of evidence attributable to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> gene model varies considerably, and therefore our
            confidence in these gene models, even the confidence in
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative transcripts encoded by the same gene,
            may differ greatly. To estimate the reliability of a
            gene model, we developed a classification system that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> data into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories: computational gene
            predictions; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein similarities</ENAMEX>; alignments of ESTs
            and other partial cDNA sequences; and alignments of
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-insert cDNA sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> point was assigned to
            each data type that overlapped a given annotation, and
            a score of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 4</TIMEX> was determined for each transcript,
            with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> being the lowest and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> being the highest
            confidence (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). As shown in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80%</NUMEX> of transcripts and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75%</NUMEX>
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were assigned a confidence value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
            Thus, we have high confidence in a large proportion of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gene models.
          
          
            Limitations in our methods
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations should be much more
            consistent than in previous releases because fewer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> were involved, a defined set of rules was
            used, and additional validation steps were performed
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). We set a rigorous standard
            for the annotations by requiring attributable evidence
            for every gene model, for example, a gene prediction,
            an alignment to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> accession, or a
            curated personal communication to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX>. However,
            during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> analysis, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> annotated
            particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of genes about which they were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> and for which they may have had specific
            unpublished information. Much of the evidence for these
            annotations was not released to the public domain and
            is not currently available, so some of the details of
            these gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. The solution
            in these cases is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to
            continue to submit error reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> to be
            curated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FlyBase</ENAMEX> as personal communications. The
            resulting set of annotations will be stronger because
            every gene has traceable evidence that is available in
            the database and is annotated according to a standard
            set of rules.
            As is expected with such a complex analysis, rules
            cannot be expected to cover every eventuality. As a
            result, some of the annotations are based partially on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curator judgment</ENAMEX>, introducing a potential source of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX>. Visual inspection and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX> expertise
            were absolutely necessary in overcoming shortcomings of
            the automated processes such as identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> splice
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and sorting out complex gene models. It was also
            essential for annotating unusual cases, such as the
            dicistronic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and overlapping gene models. Further,
            it should be noted that manual annotation is an
            iterative process. Subsequent to an initial annotation
            call, a set of automatic verification steps was carried
            out. Potential errors were reviewed and, where
            appropriate, annotations were modified as a result of
            the verification analysis.
          
        
        
          Accessing data and reporting errors
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genomic sequence available at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] includes all gene models, that is,
          the extent of transcripts and each corresponding CDS.
          More complete information, including all classes of
          evidence, can be obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX>, presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadfly Gene Annotation</ENAMEX> reports, in interactive Genome
          Browser maps, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> annotation tool, and by batch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">download</ENAMEX>. In addition to transcript structures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotation</ENAMEX> report presents the evidence supporting a gene
          model, any comments included by the annotator, and a
          thumbnail view of the immediate genomic region. There are
          links to the reports for adjacent genes, to the FlyBase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genome Browser</ENAMEX> view of the surrounding region, and to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX> files of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, transcript, and genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Another link takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to the results of
          automated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>] analyses of the
          predicted peptides. The coordinates, comments, and
          sub-features of the annotations (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>, exons, and
          so on) can be downloaded in a number of formats,
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFF</ENAMEX>. The interactive genome browser
          shows all transcripts annotated within a region; a zoom
          feature allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to choose the level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>. Additional data classes can be added, at the
          discretion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, including the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones used for
          determination of the genomic sequence, and the position
          of P-element <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> isolated by the BDGP <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disruption Project</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> can also use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> genome annotation
          and curation tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] to view the supporting data in
          greater detail. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Java</ENAMEX> software tool is available for
          local installation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>] and bulk downloads of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> and computational evidence are available in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> or GFF format [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>]. Sequence data in multiple FASTA
          format for the entire set of annotations are also
          available at this site. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> includes
          software to request and retrieve the annotations and
          other data transparently from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase/BDGP</ENAMEX>. Many
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have already contributed
          substantially to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations by submitting
          corrections to gene structures using the error report
          forms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> can continue to submit
          reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> in this manner. In the future, we hope
          that by enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to send an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo XML</ENAMEX> output
          file to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> for review, error reporting of fine gene
          structures will be simplified.
        
        
          Future updates
          
            Changes to the sequence
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> will continue to finish the remaining
            problematic regions of the euchromatic genomic sequence
            to high quality (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]), and focus efforts on
            refining the sequence of the heterochromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
            Changes to the sequence will be submitted to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 6 to 12 months</TIMEX>.
            Because sequence updates at the time of new releases
            will result in changes to the coordinate system for
            each chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> accession
            units, it will be particularly important for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to make note of specific release and
            version dates when providing sequence coordinates.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX> encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to refer to coordinates
            as associated with specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> accession
            and version numbers.
          
          
            Changes to gene models
            Future re-annotation will be on a gene-by-gene
            basis, rather than a survey of the entire genome.
            Future analyses will include new large-scale datasets,
            including the 
            Anopheles gambiae genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
            Changes to the gene models will occur more often than
            changes in the sequence, and will be reported in
            date-stamped updates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> records. Such changes are
            reflected in the feature annotations only and thus do
            not constitute new releases, as the underlying genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> does not change.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> will also focus on the localization of many
            more annotation features to the genome view, such as
            regulatory elements, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mutational lesions</ENAMEX>, rearrangement
            breakpoints, and P-element insertion sites. Many of
            these sequence features are already in the FlyBase
            genetic data tables and gene annotation reports, based
            on data from literature curation, computational
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> (for example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>]), and large-scale projects
            such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP Gene Disruption Project</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Changes to functional annotation
            In the annotation of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> attributes
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> were predicted with respect to their
            molecular functions, the roles they might play in
            biological processes, and their cellular locations,
            using the controlled vocabularies developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX>]. These predictions were
            computational, using a program known as LOVEATFIRSTSITE
            written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Yandell</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Since then, FlyBase
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> have assessed each of these annotations,
            retaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX> only those that were reasonably
            secure, and have re-annotated many genes with GO terms
            of higher granularity. This work, together with the
            curation of GO terms from the literature and sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, has resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,299</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> sharing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,057</NUMEX> GO
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. This analysis has not yet been repeated
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gene products, but the curation of GO
            terms for all new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and all split/merged genes is
            now in progress. When this annotation is completed we
            will have a benchmark for further automatic predictions
            of GO terms, using programs similar to LOVEATFIRSTSITE
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PANTHER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX>].
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Annotation of eukaryotic genomes is not a
        straightforward process, owing to the limitations of the
        current gene-prediction algorithms. However, we have made
        the annotation process much more rigorous by utilizing a
        large set of experimental data, manual curation, and
        defined standards. By using a large amount of cDNA
        alignment data and a tool facilitating the rapid visual
        inspection of evidence for each gene model, we were able to
        significantly improve the quality of 
        Drosophila gene annotations. We found
        that a comprehensive set of curation rules was crucial to
        making manual annotation consistent and reliable. We also
        found that comparison of predicted peptides to
        experimentally verified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> sequences was
        an important quality-assessment step. In future, we plan to
        make the automated analysis of predicted polypeptides,
        including identification of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> and
        sequence similarities, a more integrated part of genomic
        sequence annotation. Finally, by making the annotations,
        comments, and all supporting evidence available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>,
        we have provided the scientific community with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to assess the quality of each gene model.
        Our analysis reveals a number of genes that fall outside
        the definition of conventional gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>: neighboring
        genes with overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>; genes with alternative
        transcripts encoding distinct coding regions; and
        dicistronic transcripts. An even larger number of genes
        show alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> or are nested within neighboring
        genes. Currently, gene-prediction algorithms are unable to
        accurately predict such gene models. Studies like this one
        are a prerequisite to extending current computational
        methods to more successfully and specifically predict
        eukaryotic gene structures, by defining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of
        features and the requirements for supporting evidence. Once
        sophisticated computational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pipelines</ENAMEX> can cope with the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> range of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> genomic features, we will benefit
        from better resources for biological investigation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> is one of several major model <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> databases
        with high-quality euchromatic sequence charged with
        curation of experimental data from the literature. Unlike
        many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has a genetic history
        reaching back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>, and an enormous amount of data to
        tie to the sequence. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have addressed one
        of the first challenges, accurately annotating the genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, by utilizing the extensive resource of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-insert 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster cDNA sequences and
        FlyBase gene records (containing existing community data),
        and by manually curating the gene models using defined
        methods and controlled vocabularies. However, there is more
        work necessary to tie the annotated genomic sequence and
        annotated peptide sequences to further experimental data
        from the literature, results of large-scale analyses (for
        example, microarray expression data), and new computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> (for example, comparative sequence analysis). We
        believe shared data-exchange formats and ontologies will be
        vitally important to curate, collate, and structure this
        huge amount of data in a way that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to
        exploit the information to its full potential.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Curation rules
          We have attempted to provide documentation for as many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> decisions as possible. In addition to
          providing access to evidence (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and full-insert cDNA
          sequence reads, prior sequence submissions, BLASTX
          homologies, and gene prediction data), we have developed
          and made available a set of annotation rules (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>]
          and additional data files) and have provided textual
          comments to explain atypical or subjective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>.
          The annotation rules promote consistency in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> effort, and deal with all aspects of
          annotation: from assessment of whether a marginal gene
          prediction should be the basis for a new gene model to
          the annotation of atypical splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>; from the
          determination of alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcriptional</ENAMEX> starts and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stops</ENAMEX>, and the designation of translation starts, to the
          use of comments to flag atypical or questionable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. Cases with insufficient, atypical, or
          conflicting data that the rules did not address were left
          to the discretion of the annotator; in such instances,
          comments to document the subjective nature of the gene
          model were added.
          Typically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> annotation was created
          containing each site of alternative splicing represented
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data. For atypical splice junctions, a
          higher level of supporting data was required (see below).
          Often, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of alternative splicing were supported by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> but not full-insert cDNAs. Since, as a matter of
          policy, we tried to avoid creating partial transcript
          models, this required that we postulate transcripts
          combining, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ESTs corresponding to
          different cDNAs. In some cases, these combinations may
          not exist 
          in vivo . In particularly complex
          cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> did not create every splice form
          suggested by the data, but commented that the potential
          exists for additional splice forms.
          The rules used were specific for this annotation
          effort, in particular, for the types of data currently
          available. For example, because of the limited amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data, little attempt was made to annotate
          alternative transcripts that differ as a result of
          multiple polyadenylation sites.
          Establishment of the annotation rules included the
          development of a set of controlled comments, that is,
          comments that are reproducibly phrased and are
          consistently used. Such controlled comments were used to
          confirm atypical gene structures, such as the use of
          atypical splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>, and to
          document the evidence used in subjective cases, such as
          an unusual gene structure based on a single <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> or a gene
          model based solely on gene-prediction data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNA
          clones that appeared to contradict other evidence were
          also flagged; most frequently, these were not full-length
          or appeared to contain intronic sequences.
        
        
          Annotation of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes
          To annotate small, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding RNA genes</ENAMEX>
          previously collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> database, we
          retrieved sequences for each gene from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]
          and generated a multiple-FASTA dataset. Occasionally,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was retrieved from the original literature. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX> dataset was then aligned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genome by
          Sim4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignment</ENAMEX>. MicroRNAs were aligned by BLASTN
          analysis; a single exact match was found for each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microRNAs</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Evidence for gene structures
          
            Gene prediction data
            The publicly available version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>, which does
            not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">utilize EST</TIMEX> or BLAST evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], predicted
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,794</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the finished sequence. GENSCAN
            predicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. As reported previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> appears to predict fewer false positives,
            perhaps because it has been trained on 
            Drosophila sequences, whereas
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> has only been trained on vertebrate datasets [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> also shows greater sensitivity
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Genie</ENAMEX>, identifying some real genes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>
            fails to find. To balance the false-positive and
            false-negative rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX>, we used an empirical
            prediction score as a threshold, as done previously [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. In the absence of other supporting evidence for a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, we used GENSCAN predictions only when at least
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> had a score > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>; this is a stringent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 21%</NUMEX> of the genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> with
            full-length cDNA evidence do not contain any exons
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring > 45</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX/TBLASTX</ENAMEX> sequence similarity data
            To detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with significant sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BLASTX</ENAMEX> to compare translated
            genomic sequence to peptides in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> included
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWALL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 83</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> to compare translated
            genomic sequence to virtual translations of the rodent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX>] and insect sequences in dbEST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>].
            We also looked for sequence similarities to 
            Drosophila peptides that had
            experimental verification, but not to those
            representing purely hypothetical or computational gene
            models (see below). Although the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
            a public database like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] has increased
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponentially</ENAMEX> in the time between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX>], the increased size of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein datasets</ENAMEX> resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> increase in the
            number of fly genes that produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
            similarity to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,612</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> genes showed a
            match to another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We now find that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,996</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>)
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> show a match by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> or TBLASTX (with expectation value less than or
            equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 × e -7</ENAMEX>). However, we note that the datasets
            we used were fixed before the release of the genomic
            sequence of 
            A. gambiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX>], the only other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dipteran</ENAMEX> (or arthropod) with a complete genome
            sequence. We expect that a higher percentage of 
            Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will show
            sequence similarity to 
            Anopheles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, because 
            A. gambiae is more closely
            related to 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster than are the
            other available model organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and cDNA alignment data
            Prediction of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> was made more rigorous by
            the increased availability of cDNA data. However,
            misleading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> can be created by the presence of
            genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA contaminants</ENAMEX>, cDNA clones containing two
            independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> co-ligated in the same plasmid vector
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">chimeras</NUMEX>), and internal priming of cDNAs during
            library synthesis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones derived from
            incompletely processed primary transcripts are not
            readily distinguishable from alternative splicing
            without experimental verification. Moreover, cDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> designated as full length may actually be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,000</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> full-insert
            sequences from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> are probably not full-length [
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sim4</NUMEX> alignment tool can make mistakes in
            determining splice site junctions or completely fail to
            align very small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 67</TIMEX>]; indeed, a small
            number of cases of failure to align microexons were
            identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stapleton</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] when they compared
            the predicted translation products of cDNAs with those
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gene models. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . found <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">est2genome</ENAMEX> and
            other alignment tools were, in general, not superior to
            Sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 67</TIMEX>]. Despite these limitations, alignment of
            complete <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cDNA sequences</ENAMEX> is invaluable in detecting
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>, alternative splicing events, detailed exon-intron
            structures, nested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and other key aspects of gene
            models.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX>-insert 
            Drosophila melanogaster cDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> came from a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The largest
            set of full-insert cDNA sequences came from the BDGP 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> (DGC)
            project [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 29, 30</ENAMEX>]. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,297</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>) show a match to full-insert sequences from
            the cDNA clones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>, and in some cases, more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> clone provided definitive gene models for
            alternatively spliced products. At the time of
            annotation, we had access to full-insert sequencing
            reads from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,074</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,910 cDNA</NUMEX> clones, but only
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 6,000</NUMEX> of these had been fully assembled. Gene
            models based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">incompletely</TIMEX> assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">marked 'incomplete'</ENAMEX>. These gene models will be among
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> annotations to be updated.
            Sequences deposited in public databanks like
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>] by 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> provided
            definitive evidence for a number of genes. For a subset
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">well-studied genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> synthesized all
            of the available sequence and literature data into high
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quality Annotated Reference Gene Sequences</ENAMEX> (ARGS) that
            have been deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
            These ARGS sequences correspond to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">795</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX>.
            Other sequences came directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FlyBase</ENAMEX> as error
            reports from the scientific community. FlyBase curated
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">636</NUMEX> reports with information about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,094</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as
            personal communications, and any sequences supplied in
            these reports were aligned to the genome. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">825</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) of the annotations overlapped these sequences
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Accurate annotation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
            in particular was greatly facilitated by sequence

            Determination of confidence values
            The extent of each transcript and corresponding CDS
            was extracted from the ' 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Genomic Sequence</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotations</ENAMEX>' file (in GFF format [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX>]), which is
            available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>]. The extent of overlap of each
            transcript against the supporting evidence used during
            the re-annotation was determined using an intersection
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to determine the annotations overlapped by
            particular types of evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
            The evidence datasets used included: gene prediction
            based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENSCAN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sim4</ENAMEX> alignments
            to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and full-insert cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads derived
            from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> cDNA project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>], the earlier
            analysis of the

            example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase ARGS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]; GenBank/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">EMBL</ENAMEX>/DDBJ
            entries identified as

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 9, 10, 11</TIMEX>] and error report submissions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> [
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]; and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BLASTX protein</ENAMEX> homology data. For a complete
            list of the evidence datasets and their description see
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were filtered using the Bioinformatics
            Output <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parser</ENAMEX> (BOP), which also assembled <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all EST</TIMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-insert cDNA sequence reads from a particular cDNA
            clone into a virtual assembly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>
            tool displayed these assemblies with sequence gaps
            indicated differently from introns.
            The algorithm used to assess relative annotation
            quality assigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point for overlap of a gene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX>, either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> or GENSCAN or both. One
            additional point was assigned for overlap with protein
            similarity data. The remaining datasets were considered
            in the following order and resulted in an additional
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points: the cDNA and annotation data were
            analyzed to determine if any entry in this class
            spanned the entire length of the CDS; if so, an
            additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points were assigned, and if not,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX> and error report entries were
            analyzed and if any spanned the length of CDS, two
            points were assigned; if none of these data classes
            corresponded to the full-length CDS, then the existence
            of partial cDNA data and/or overlapping <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data
            merited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point. Details of the rules for this
            classification system can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Integrity checks

            Sequin software tool from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>], which found
            mistakes in exon-intron structure, start of

            appropriate. We checked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> that overlapped
            transposable elements and tRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, or appeared
            multiple times in the genome with duplicate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX>. We verified that deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> had no independent evidence in
            literature-curated references. Finally, in order to
            allow the construction of a wild-type proteome from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> sequenced 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y 1</ENAMEX>; 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cn 1</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bw 1</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sp 1strain</ENAMEX>, we replaced annotated
            sequences from known mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>, cn, bw, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MstProx, LysE</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rh6</TIMEX> )
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq</ENAMEX> wild-type sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> with an
            appropriate note.
          
          
            Non-consensus splice sites
            All introns within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> were
            examined for conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> splice junctions with the
            Sequin program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>], and all instances of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> splice junctions were
            inspected and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commented</ENAMEX> upon. Splice junctions were
            based upon alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cDNA</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequence and, in the
            absence of such data, on gene prediction models. Even
            for transcript <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> based upon <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data, the
            number of atypical splice junctions is probably an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimate</ENAMEX>. The alignment algorithm used (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sim4</NUMEX>)
            forced intron junctions to occur at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> sites
            whenever possible, even at the expense of a
            several-base mismatch. This occasionally resulted in
            apparent early translation termination, in which case
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotator</ENAMEX> checked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> that would allow
            read-through. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> splice annotations were based on
            information in the literature or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. With the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> junctions, we
            imposed a higher standard of verification for
            unconventional splice annotations: sequence data from a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> isolated from the sequenced strain, or multiple
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consistent ESTs</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL</ENAMEX> validation of the models
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein databases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]
            were used to validate the integrity of the annotations
            and to track consistency with previously published
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SWISS-PROT Protein Knowledgebase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>] is a
            curated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence database that provides a high
            level of annotation, a minimal level of redundancy and
            high level of integration with other databases. The
            TrEMBL database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>] contains the translations of all
            CDS present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nucleotide Sequence Database</ENAMEX> [
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>], which are not yet integrated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>]. A non-redundant set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and TrEMBL 
            Drosophila sequences was created,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> representing purely hypothetical or
            computational gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (those corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG</ENAMEX>, or EG genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX>) were excluded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX>-QC
            program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] compared the resulting collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3687</TIMEX>
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster sequences
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX>) to the annotated peptides using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. Each gene was placed into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 'validation'
            categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Perfect</ENAMEX> match to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX> (annotated
            peptide of identical length with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sequence
            identity), Single AA substitutions (annotated peptide
            of identical length with ≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> sequence identity),
            Significant mismatch (annotated peptide and SPTRreal
            entry do not align over their entire length, but do
            contain aligned spans of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> peptide
            length, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 97%</NUMEX> sequence identity), or Poor
            match (poor or no BLAST hits). For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first two</TIMEX>
            categories, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX> peptide was allowed to match a
            portion of the annotated peptide if it was designated
            as a 'fragment' of the full peptide sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">125</ENAMEX> or
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4%</NUMEX> of SPTRreal genes are designated with this
            tag).
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX> of all genes with a cognate
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Perfect</ENAMEX> match and Single AA
            substitution categories (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,764</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,687</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Curators</ENAMEX>
            examined every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> marked Single AA substitutions,
            Significant mismatch, or Poor match. In some cases,
            annotation errors were detected and gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
            modified to produce a translation matching the SPTRreal
            sequence. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP-QC</ENAMEX> output
            to change translation start sites to the experimentally
            reported position where appropriate. In other cases,
            discrepancies may be due to strain polymorphisms,
            errors in the reported DNA sequence on which the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPTRreal</ENAMEX> entries were based, or undetected errors in
            either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> or sequence. Given the
            high quality of the underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, we believe that in many cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            annotations are more accurate than the SPTRreal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
            The improvement over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> is
            evident. The combined number of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Perfect</ENAMEX> match and
            Single AA substitution annotations has increased by
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,260</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,764</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>,
            while the combined number of Significant mismatch and
            Poor match annotations has decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,427</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">923</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>). Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> has incorporated sequences from
            Releases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> of the genomic annotations into the
            curated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Whitfield</ENAMEX>, personal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). Therefore, while the overall quality of
            the sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> has almost certainly
            increased during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, it is still worth asking
            the question - how well do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotations
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">match SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> sequences deposited before the initial
            genome annotations? This question was answered for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> using a dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,049</NUMEX>
            polypeptide sequences created in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> before
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, prior to the publication of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>, of
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> set had an annotated peptide of
            identical length with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 95%</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. J. Gentles</ENAMEX>, personal communication). Performing the
            same analysis using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX>, we find
            that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">694</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>, of the peptides in the same
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> dataset match with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> identity. This <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
            increase in the number of matching polypeptides most
            likely is a reflection of the improvement in the
            quality of the annotations. But what about the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> of
            cases that show significant mismatch between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>? We have examined these cases and
            believe that the large majority of these remaining
            discrepancies are not due to mistakes in our
            annotation, but due to strain polymorphisms, as well as
            errors in the sequence underlying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX>-PROT
            entries created before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. If this were indeed the
            case, then the analysis of Karlin 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] would have grossly
            overestimated the error rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>.
