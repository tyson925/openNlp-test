        Type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T1DM</NUMEX>) is a T cell-mediated
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> characterized by lymphocytic
        infiltration of the pancreatic islets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langerhans</ENAMEX> with
        subsequent destruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing beta cells
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Non-obese diabetic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX>) female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, a murine
        model for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>, spontaneously develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>-of-age, with infiltrating cells appearing around the
        pancreatic islets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as at 3-4 weeks</TIMEX>-of-age [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        T1DM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">susceptibility</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mouse</ENAMEX> is linked to I-A
        g7, the murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II gene that encodes a histidine
        at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> and a serine at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> in the Œ≤ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>,
        in place of the more frequent proline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56Œ≤</NUMEX> and aspartic acid
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57Œ≤</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is prevented in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX>.PD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-A g7</ENAMEX>) that carry a Œ≤
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chain transgene</ENAMEX> with site-specific mutations that restore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartic acid</ENAMEX> at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56Œ≤ and 57Œ≤</TIMEX>,
        respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, because of the two amino
        acid changes in the additional (transgenic) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele Œ≤</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NOD</ENAMEX>.PD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX>.PD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> recognize three
        additional peptide epitopes in the glutamic acid
        decarboxylase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GAD65</NUMEX>) autoantigen [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Among beta-cell autoantigens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAD65</ENAMEX> is an important
        initial target of the immune response that results in
        beta-cell destruction and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . While both humoral and cellular
        responses to GAD65 occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 4 weeks of age</TIMEX> in NOD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , there is considerable evidence that
        beta-cell-specific T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells are the effectors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>,
        whereas T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells appear to have a protective
        role [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Accordingly, a shift of the autoimmune
        response from T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> has represented a
        promising strategy for prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and other T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-mediated autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GAD65</NUMEX> to young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>
        has been shown to prevent insulitis and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] ,
        apparently via induction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ regulatory T cells with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Similarly,
        treatment with immunodominant peptides of myelin can
        prevent or reverse experimental autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalomyelitis</ENAMEX> (EAE), a T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-associated inducible "autoimmune"
        disorder that is widely used as a model for human multiple
        sclerosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Unfortunately, recent work indicates that the
        application of strategies to shift autoimmune responses
        from T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> predominance is not without risk.
        Thus, some of us recently showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        self peptides that can induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EAE</ENAMEX>, myelin proteolipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein peptide</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">139 to 151</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PLP139-151</ENAMEX>) or myelin
        oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-55</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MOG35-55</ENAMEX>), can
        result in severe anaphylactic reactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This
        result clearly indicated that severe allergic reactions to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> can occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that have been 
        induced to express pathology (i.e.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX>) related to "autoimmunity" to these peptides. However,
        it was initially unclear whether anaphylactic reactivity
        also could be elicited to self peptides that have been
        implicated in the development of a 
        spontaneous autoimmune disorder.
        In the present study, we show that anti-peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> and fatal anaphylactic reactions can be
        elicited by immunodominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAD65</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> that
        have been injected with these peptides intraperitoneally in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incomplete Freund</ENAMEX>'s adjuvant (IFA), as part of an attempt
        to induce "tolerance" and prevent the spontaneous
        development of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>. Moreover, while this manuscript was in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> reported that anti-peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> and fatal anaphylaxis can be induced in NOD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that have been immunized with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> peptides
        B:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-23</ENAMEX> or B:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-23</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> study, the peptides were
        administered subcutaneously in saline without adjuvant. As
        reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] several lines of
        evidence indicate that amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 9</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> B
        chain also represent a major target of anti-islet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoimmunity</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>. Taken together with the findings
        reported herein, this work indicates that anaphylactic
        reactions can be elicited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that have been immunized
        with pancreatic islet-associated self-peptides that also
        represent significant targets of autoimmunity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>.

          In an attempt to induce a T

          female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-A g7</ENAMEX>) were immunized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> i.p.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">206-226/217</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">236/286</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>) or of the additional GAD65
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NOD</ENAMEX>.PD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (I-A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD/PD</ENAMEX>) (GAD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">333-345/K458-470R</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . As noted in the
          background section, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides are not immunodominant in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>. Indeed, we originally included the PD-immunized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides are the immunodominant epitopes
          that are presented in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD</ENAMEX>.PD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that do 
          not get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
          Because of their unknown, and potentially even
          protective, role in the diabetes-resistant NOD.PD strain,
          we felt that it was important to assess whether, through
          a peptide therapy regimen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides might be able to
          protect against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> by shifting T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> responses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>. As our
          study unfolded, and we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> peptide therapy
          induced anaphylactic reactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>, we felt that
          it was important to evaluate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides might
          also induce allergic responses in the NOD strain.
          As demonstrated in our study, immunization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides can induce both a specific IgG1 response
          and also anaphylactic reactivity. On the other hand, as
          might be predicted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides induced a less robust
          IgG1 response (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and also a lower incidence and
          severity of anaphylaxis (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) when
          injected into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> than did G7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX>. In an
          attempt to induce anaphylactic reactivity to peptides
          known to induce T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> responses associated with allergic
          reactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> were immunized using the same
          protocol with hen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lysozyme</ENAMEX> and ovalbumin peptides
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81-96</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OVA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">323-339</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . As a negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> injections of saline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emulsified</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four weeks</TIMEX> after the last of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peptides</ENAMEX>/IFA or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">saline</ENAMEX>/IFA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peptides</ENAMEX>/IFA were challenged i.p. with the
          same peptides used for the immunizations dissolved in
          saline, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had been injected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline/IFA</ENAMEX> were challenged with saline alone. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
          of challenge, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
          with the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the saline group
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>).
          All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">G7 peptides</ENAMEX> developed
          severe anaphylactic shock (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/14</NUMEX>), with the
          majority of them dying within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injection</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12/14</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In addition to the
          classical signs of anaphylaxis, such as reddening of the
          skin, prostration and respiratory impairment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          underwent a dramatic drop in body temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          which confirmed the presence of anaphylactic shock.
          Moreover, the death rate from anaphylaxis was
          substantially higher than in any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in which
          anaphylaxis occurred (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          On the other hand, the clinical and physiological
          features of anaphylaxis elicited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G7</TIMEX> peptides were
          similar to those observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>- and gender-matched NOD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice undergoing IgE</ENAMEX>-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Although the death rate was significantly
          higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G7</TIMEX> challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12/14</NUMEX>)
          compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgE-sensitized</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNP-HSA</ENAMEX> challenged group

          those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that developed anaphylaxis
          exhibited quite similar drops in body temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1B). Similarly, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that was
          challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> peptides exhibited a higher incidence
          of anaphylactic responses than did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> challenged
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX> peptides (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the temperature changes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) and death rates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that did
          develop a reaction were quite similar.
          None of the na√Øve age/gender-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> (these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> received no injection prior to challenge) that were
          challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> peptides showed any signs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0/9</NUMEX>; P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test
          for comparison vs. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> immunized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G7</ENAMEX> challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This result indicates that priming of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> is required for the
          elicitation of the allergic response.
          Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides, that are
          not immunodominant in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/7</NUMEX>) developed
          anaphylactic shock at the time of challenge with PD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus, the incidence of anaphylactic
          shock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized and challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides
          was significantly lower than that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized and
          challenged with immunodominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0058</NUMEX> by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test). Moreover, of those PD-immunized,
          PD-challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that did exhibit an anaphylactic
          reaction, the drop in temperature was less sustained than
          that in those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that exhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> died (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In accord with these results, immunization of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> peptides produced a less robust
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG1 antibody</ENAMEX> response than did immunization
          with the immunodominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> (see below). As
          expected, none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">saline</ENAMEX>/IFA
          alone developed anaphylaxis upon i.p. challenge with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Notably, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HEL</ENAMEX>/OVA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emulsified</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX>, anaphylactic responses were also
          provoked by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">i.p. immunization</ENAMEX> with peptides
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10/12</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/4</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/10</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX>).
          However, these anaphylactic responses were less severe
          than those induced by subsequent peptide challenge of the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, with a less dramatic drop in body temperature
          (data not shown) and no deaths. Finally, although the
          numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of
          peptide challenge in each of the immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was
          small (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX>), there were no statistically significant
          differences in the incidence of anaphylactic reactions in
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice vs. mice</ENAMEX> that were normoglycemic at the time
          of peptide challenge.
        
        
          IgG1, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgG2a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> responses
          Antibody responses were analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> in serum
          obtained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 days</TIMEX> before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 week</TIMEX> challenge with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> or saline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice immunized</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> peptides
          had high IgG titers against the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> peptides, with levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgG1</ENAMEX> being significantly higher than those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IgG2a</TIMEX> (P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX> test, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-tailed; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
          Anti-G7 IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> generally were not detectable in
          the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (PD- or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HEL</ENAMEX>/OVA- immunized, or IFA
          alone) or in the non-injected (na√Øve) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          exceptions were a single non-immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> with anti-G7
          IgG1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (at a serum concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> Œ<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ºg/ml</ENAMEX>),
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> mouse immunized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX> with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G7</NUMEX> IgG2a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (at a serum concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">492 ng/ml</ENAMEX>).
          Anti-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgG1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG2a antibodies</ENAMEX> also were detected
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>- (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX>- (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>) immunized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, although the magnitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> responses to
          these peptides (especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IgG1</TIMEX> response) were
          substantially less than those to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> peptides.
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> concentrations were slightly, but
          significantly, higher in the peptide-immunized groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX>) compared to those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> injected
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX> and saline alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, the serum
          concentrations of total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> were very similar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          that had been immunized with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL/OVA</ENAMEX> peptides
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This study clearly demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> immunization
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> with preparations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD65</TIMEX> self peptides in IFA
        can cause a marked shift towards a T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> like response, as reflected by high
        levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IgG1</TIMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> recently demonstrated that
        strong IgG1 responses can be induced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> that have
        been immunized subcutaneously with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> peptides
        administered in physiological saline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However, both
        studies showed that anaphylaxis can be induced in such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        upon subsequent re-challenge with preparations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> used for immunization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, the
        anaphylactic reactions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had been immunized and
        challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> were severe, with reductions in
        body temperature that were very similar to those observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice exhibiting IgE</ENAMEX>-dependent passive systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> and with a very high fatality rate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12/14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> also developed in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> that
        had been immunized and challenged with preparations of PD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> (that are not immunodominant in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>),
        although both the drop in body temperature and the death
        rate in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were significantly less than those
        observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immunized and challenged with G7
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>.
        There were both similarities and differences between our
        findings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mouse</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T1DM</ENAMEX> and those in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX> requires specific
        immunization with self peptides (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">139-151</ENAMEX> or
        MOG35-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>), and these peptides generally are administered in
        complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s adjuvant (CFA). By contrast, T1DM
        develops spontaneously in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>. On the other hand,
        induction of anaphylactic reactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> appeared
        to require immunization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAD65</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> (in
        this model, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX>), as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">na√Øve NOD mice</ENAMEX> challenged with G7
        peptides exhibited no detectible reactions, and none of
        them died (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus, in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NOD T1DM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (this study, and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ) some form of
        artificial "immunization" with a self peptide preparation
        appears to be required for the development of anaphylactic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> to "self". This of course is not a surprising
        result. Indeed, it is challenging to conceive of any
        possible selective advantage that would be conferred by a
        propensity to develop, under "natural" conditions,
        potentially fatal allergic reactions to components of self.
        It remains to be determined whether self peptide
        immunization protocols that induce anaphylactic reactivity
        do so simply because of the manner in which they present
        large amounts of self peptides to the immune system, or
        because of other factors, such as the presence in the
        peptide preparations of aggregates or other components
        beside self peptide monomers.
        Whatever the underlying reason(s) for the development of
        anaphylactic reactivity to these self peptide preparations,
        in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NOD T1DM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, anaphylactic
        reactions occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had developed strong IgG1
        responses to the relevant self peptides, with only modest
        changes in total IgE levels. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific
        anaphylactic reactivity is thought to be mediated solely
        (or primarily) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, whereas it has long been
        known that either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgE</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG1 antibodies</ENAMEX> can mediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ).
        However, it has been reported that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IgG1</NUMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> in the mouse is associated with substantially
        less histological evidence of mast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> degranulation than
        is observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgE</ENAMEX>-dependent anaphylaxis in that species [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . In neither of the models of "autoimmunity" that we
        have studied (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX>) was anaphylaxis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with histological evidence of substantial mast
        cell degranulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] (data not shown). Taken together,
        these findings suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG1 antibodies</ENAMEX> contribute
        importantly to the development of anaphylaxis in both of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, we can not rule out some
        role for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgE antibodies</ENAMEX> in these reactions.
        Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] found that, in NOD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had been immunized with peptide B:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-23</ENAMEX>, treatment
        with both anti <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FcŒ≥RII/RIII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-IgE</ENAMEX> monoclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> was required to prevent anaphylaxis upon
        challenge with the peptide. Interestingly, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] did not detect IgE
        antibodies to B:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-23</ENAMEX> or B:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-23</NUMEX> in the serum of their NOD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had been immunized with B:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-23</NUMEX>
        peptide at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Œºg/</ENAMEX>dose exhibited a robust and
        dose-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG1 antibody</ENAMEX> response to the peptide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        . Thus, in both B:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-23</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX>-associated anaphylaxis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ) and GAD65
        peptide-associated anaphylaxis (our study), anti-peptide
        IgG1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> contribute to the response. However, IgE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> also appear to contribute to anaphylaxis to
        B:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and may also be involved in our
        model.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> point not yet clarified by the comparison of the
        present results, those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and those of Pedotti
        
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] is whether the
        influence of thymic expression of the self peptide on the
        propensity to develop anaphylactic reactivity differs in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NOD T1DM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. In the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedotti et</ENAMEX> al.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , it was noted that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> self peptides that
        induced anaphylactic reactivity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOG</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-55</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLP139-151</ENAMEX>,
        are not expressed in the thymus, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> peptides
        tested that did not induce anaphylactic reactivity, PLP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p 178-191</ENAMEX> and MBPA 
        C <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-11</TIMEX>, are expressed at that site.
        However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAD65</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAD67</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> can be detected in the
        thymic medullary epithelial cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
        despite thymic expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD65 and GAD67</TIMEX> at the level
        of mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> spontaneously develop autoreactivity to
        these islet (and brain) expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-challenge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that have been immunized with peptides
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from GAD65</TIMEX> results in severe anaphylactic reactions. On the
        other hand, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAD65</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAD67 protein</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymus</ENAMEX> has not yet been reported. Similarly, as reviewed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , although several
        lines of evidence indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is present in the
        thymus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, it is possible that the specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin peptides</ENAMEX> that induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anaphylaxis</ENAMEX> in their study
        are not ordinarily present in that site. As a result, it
        has not yet been demonstrated that anaphylactic reactions
        can develop to self peptides that are expressed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymus</ENAMEX>.
        It should be emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NOD mice</ENAMEX> have a partial
        defect in thymic negative selection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] , a defect in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FcŒ≥RIIB</ENAMEX> (that can negatively regulate anaphylactic
        reactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] ), and perhaps other genetic
        polymorphisms that may result in immunological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperresponsiveness</ENAMEX>. The same is likely to be true in at
        least some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and in patients
        in the pre-diabetic phase. Therefore, because of the risk
        of induction of anaphylactic sensitization, extreme caution
        needs to be used in developing any type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific
        immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention or treatment
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>. This caution probably should be extended to all
        attempts to shift immune responses to self or foreign
        antigens from a T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to a T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H 2</ENAMEX> response. Indeed, in a recent phase
        II clinical trial, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> given an altered
        peptide ligand (APL) of a myelin basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> epitope
        developed immediate hypersensitivity reactions after
        multiple injections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Thus, it would
        appear that great care must be taken when injecting
        preparations of putative "tolerogens" in attempts to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppress T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-mediated autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
