        Extensive bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow infiltration</ENAMEX> with cancer cells and
        anticancer therapy lead to immune incompetence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Since the prognosis and overall
        survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> have dramatically improved
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 30 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , problems remain related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, mainly during leukopenic periods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Causal pathogens of febrile neutropenia (FN), most
        frequently bacterial or fungal, are identified and
        confirmed by culture in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6</NUMEX> ] . In
        other <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-25%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX>, bacterial or fungal
        pathogens are suspected clinically. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The remaining 50%</NUMEX> of
        cases are classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO) and
        may be caused by other pathogens, namely viruses, that are
        more difficult to detect by conventional diagnostic methods
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Lymphotropic herpesviruses (LH) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein-Barr</ENAMEX> virus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX>), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus-6
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6</ENAMEX>) establish a lifelong persistent infection in a
        great majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. They usually produce inaparent
        infection or transient immune compromise in otherwise
        healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> but are able to cause life-threatening
        primary or reactivated infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        congenital or acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunodeficiencies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . The spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> caused by
        lymphotropic herpesviruses is well documented in patients
        undergoing bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow transplantation</ENAMEX> (BMT) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ]
        or organ transplantation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] and in individuals
        infected with human immunodeficiency virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ]
        . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing conventional anticancer therapy
        without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX>, the data focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> or HHV-6
        infection are scarcely documented and mostly reported as
        individual cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . With combined diagnostic
        approach of serology and viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection we performed a
        prospective study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> undergoing non-BMT therapy
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to demostrate the incidence of LH
        infections.

          Statistical analysis
          Unconditional logistic regression analysis was
          performed with pre-treatment (presence or absence of
          virus) as the dichotomous outcome measure. For this
          analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or controls), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (as a
          continuous variable), and the interaction of age and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were the independent measures. This analysis was
          repeated for each viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serology</ENAMEX>. To control for age,
          logistic regressions were performed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each age</TIMEX> group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-5; 6-11</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-17</NUMEX>) for each viral serology with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> as the only independent variable. These analyses
          provide estimates and confidence intervals of the odds
          ratios of seroprevalence for pre-treatment cases versus
          controls adjusting for age. The same set of analyses was
          performed with post-transplant cases versus controls.
          To study pre-treatment versus post-treatment patient
          samples, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">McNemar</ENAMEX> test was performed for each viral

          Serology of LH
          Before grouping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>, a logistic regression
          analysis was performed with each viral pre-treatment
          sample as the dichotomous outcome measure and group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or controls) as the independent measure with
          age as a covariate and including the age by group
          interaction term. There was no statistically significant
          difference in overall seropositivity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          controls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV VCA IgG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.8%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.0%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV IgG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.6%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.7%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.36</NUMEX>) pre-transplant
          samples. There was a statistically significant difference
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age</TIMEX> measure showing that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and CMV
          IgG seropositive cases in pre-treatment samples increases
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>; resp. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0131</NUMEX>). The
          interaction of age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> measure was not significant
          (p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.23</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>). Overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-treatment IgG</ENAMEX> seropositivity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> was
          significantly lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in controls (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80.6%</NUMEX>
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91.3%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0231</NUMEX>). The age measure was also
          significantly different (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) demonstrating
          increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6 IgG</ENAMEX> positivity with age. The interaction
          of age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> measure for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> was not significant (p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX>).
          For each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and each virus, a logistic
          regression analysis was performed with pre-treatment
          sample as the dichotomous outcome measure and group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or controls) as the independent outcome
          measure. There were no statistically significant
          differences between pre-treatment patient samples and
          controls in all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV VCA IgG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV IgG</ENAMEX> and
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6-11 and 12-17</TIMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6 IgG</ENAMEX>. The only
          differences were noticed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-5</ENAMEX> age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgG</ENAMEX> seropositivity then
          the controls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> data including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values, odds
          ratios and odds confidence intervals are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          The same analyses were performed with post-treatment
          patient samples and controls. There was increased overall
          post-treatment seropositivity that was significantly
          different from controls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV VCA IgG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86.6%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.0%</NUMEX>;

          No difference in the age measure was found demonstrating
          that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive cases in
          post-treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> does not increase with age (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>; resp. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.62</NUMEX>). In case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6 IgG</ENAMEX>, no
          difference was found between post-treatment samples and
          controls (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.3%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91.3%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>). The age measure was
          significantly different (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0355</NUMEX>) demostrating
          increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6 IgG</ENAMEX> seropositivity with age. There was
          no significant difference in the interaction of age and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> measure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =

          For each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and each virus, a logistic
          regression analysis was performed with post-treatment
          sample as the dichotomous variable and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>) as the independent variable. There were
          statistically significant differences between

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-5</ENAMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV VCA IgG</ENAMEX> and in all age groups
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV IgG</ENAMEX> demonstrating higher seropositivity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in controls. No differences were noticed in

          To compare pre-treatment and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">post-treatment samples</ENAMEX>, a
          McNemar test was performed for each viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serology</ENAMEX>. This
          test was performed both overall, ignoring age, and then
          repeated within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each age</TIMEX> group. Overall <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">McNemar</ENAMEX> test
          demonstrated statistically significant difference between

          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">McNemar</ENAMEX> test, we compared IgG seropositivity

          according to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, i.e.
          leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          histiocytosis was not analyzed this way since the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was too small for statistical analysis). EBV

          There was also a statistically significant difference for

          able to distinguish primary infection from reactivation
          in all cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">symptomatic EBV</ENAMEX> infection based on EBNA
          IgG status. In case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6</ENAMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 2</NUMEX>
          cases, respectively, where it was impossible to

          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LH DNA</ENAMEX> and comparison with LH
          serology
          We examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty</NUMEX>

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> during anticancer treatment detected by PCR
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">+++</NUMEX>) positive, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> (+)] with serological evidence

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3provide</ENAMEX> the information
          about the differences in diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and CMV
          infection. By combination of serology and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> analysis,
          we were able to detect symptomatic infection more
          frequently in comparison to serology only (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.013</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV; p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>). As expected, the rates of
          "laboratory infection", defined as the sum of the cases
          with symptomatic infection and positive seroconversion
          for each virus, were not significantly different in these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection was present

        Discussion
        Frequent infection with herpesviruses has long been
        recognized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing allogeneic
        transplantation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute leukemia</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute leukemia</ENAMEX> it has been
        reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as two thirds</NUMEX> of seropositive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can develop reactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">herpes simplex</ENAMEX> virus
        infection during remission induction therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection in acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
        recognized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 30 years ago</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] but is of particular
        concern in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing allogeneic transplantation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 28</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> infection is frequently associated with
        post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in T
        cell-depleted grafts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . As recently reported, HHV-6
        can also be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow supression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalitis</ENAMEX> and pneumonitis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] after allogeneic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>.
        Whether symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection occurs in chemotherapy-
        and/or radiotherapy-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has not been
        reported. This report demonstrates for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> infection affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        treated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection occurred in
        almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> younger then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anticancer</ENAMEX> treatment. At the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis the
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositivity was not different in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and healthy controls. On the other hand,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reached similar EBV and CMV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seropositivity</ENAMEX> levels after anticancer treatment comparing
        to healthy adult controls. It suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        immunosupressed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have
        high incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection. As expected, primary
        infection was the most frequent in younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        reactivation occurred in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In case of HHV-6
        infection, which affects most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> by the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, we were surprised with low frequency of IgG
        antibodies in pre-treatment samples as compared with
        age-matched healthy controls. There might be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        possible mechanisms involved. First, due to either lower
        sensitivity to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6 IgG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX> or due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> supression at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis but
        similar pattern was not seen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX> or CMV. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, due to
        the possibility that prior infection with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> might be
        directly or indirectly protective against tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. This finding would be in agreement with
        Greaves hypothesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] which predicted an increased
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> precursor ALL for those of higher
        socioeconomic level, firstborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and those with
        delayed or diminished exposure to common infections in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infancy</ENAMEX>. When we studied our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis, the only statistically significant
        difference between pre- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">post-treatment samples</ENAMEX> was
        noticed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0245</NUMEX>) but not in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with lymphoma or solid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To our
        knowledge, there are no other data in the literature
        describing a protective effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HHV-6</ENAMEX> infection in
        infancy against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>. Further studies would be needed
        to test this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        As previously demonstrated, the risk of
        transfusion-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired CMV</ENAMEX> infection can be significantly
        reduced by the use of CMV-seronegative or filtered (white
        blood cell reduced) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood products</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In an effort to
        illustrate the role of leukodepleted blood transfusions in
        transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection in pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oncology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        we studied both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of patients
        treated with leukodepleted irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood products</ENAMEX> and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that did not required any blood
        transfusion during anticancer treatment. No statistically
        significant difference for each <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> virus was found in these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Those data are in accordance with recently
        published prospective study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preiksaikis et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        where the risk of transfusion-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired CMV</ENAMEX> infection was
        estimated to be less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">698</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> exposures in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        In the literature describing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, the
        results vary widely since different protocols have been
        used in different biological materials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 14</NUMEX> ] .
        PCR method was used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> or organ
        transplants but not in chemotherapy-only and/or
        radiotherapy-only treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. To our knowledge, this
        report demonstrates for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a correlation of
        serological results with viral load detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. By using healthy
        controls and setting the threshold of PCR positive versus
        negative based on correlation with clinical symptoms and
        serology, acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection could be identified in most of
        the cases. The highest incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection occurred
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>. It probably corresponds with
        the length of neutropenia and severity of immunosupression
        that is greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> compared
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with lymphoma or solid tumor.
      
      
        Conclusion
        This paper demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> and HHV-6
        infection is frequent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> treated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, is
        not transfusion-dependant, and is often associated with
        clinical symptoms. Combination of serology and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> method
        in detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">symptomatic disease</ENAMEX> is superior to serology
        alone. Further studies are needed to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
        higher risk of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LH</ENAMEX> infection to prevent
        disease-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and to test the hypothesis
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HHV-6</ENAMEX> infection early in the infancy may be protective
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> in the frame of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greaves</ENAMEX> hypothesis.
