        Since the 'seed and soil' hypothesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paget</ENAMEX> in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , it has been understood that the
        microenvironment, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'soil</NUMEX>,' surrounding the tumor 'seed'
        plays a critical part in its development. However,
        investigations into the molecular biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> are
        often carried out on cells grown 
        in vitro in culture, where the
        environment is unlike that of the 
        in vivo tissue environment in which
        cancers naturally develop. The effects of these
        environmental differences on cancer cells may account, in
        part, for the fact that only a small percentage of
        anticancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that are found to effectively kill cells 
        in vitro are successful in subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and human studies. In this study, we explored the
        changes that occur at the transcriptome level as cells
        grown 
        in vitro are transplanted into an 
        in vivo environment, where they
        develop as a tumor. The 
        in vivo environment represented here
        is that of the subcutaneous intrascapular region of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nude mouse</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different cell lines were studied: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A549,</ENAMEX>
        derived from human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U118</ENAMEX>, derived
        from human brain glioblastoma. Our study examined the
        differences in global gene expression between A549 mouse
        xenograft tumors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> cell cultures and between U118
        xenograft tumors (grown in the same location as the A549
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumors</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U118</ENAMEX> cultures. We looked for 
        in vivo versus 
        in vitro differences that were common
        to the two cell lines, and for differences that were found
        in one cell line but not the other.
        In modeling mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> development, global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiling of human-derived cells grown as
        tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> has some distinct advantages over profiling
        of tumors obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Whereas a great deal of
        genetic variability exists among different tumors from
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, lesser genetic heterogeneity would be
        expected in xenografts of cancer cells originally derived
        from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-derived tumors
        are composed of both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and non-cancer cells, making it
        difficult to precisely ascertain gene-expression patterns
        specifically attributable to cancer cells. For example, in
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer microarray</ENAMEX> studies, the actual percentage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells in a profiled sample may be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 30-40%</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . Even when using techniques such as laser capture
        microdissection, which can improve tumor purity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , the
        relative contribution of cancer cells and non-cancer cells
        to the overall gene-expression profile remains uncertain.
        In contrast, profiling human genes expressed in a mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xenograft</ENAMEX> using a human microarray chip might uncover genes
        specifically expressed in human cancer cells in xenograft
        tumors comprised of a mixture of human- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-derived
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The data obtained in a microarray experiment can be
        overwhelming, and the challenge is to understand, on a
        global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> level, the biology behind the differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of genes. In this study, we
        have searched for 'significantly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enriched</ENAMEX>' classes of genes
        among all differentially expressed genes. These are classes
        or functional categories of genes that appear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overrepresented</ENAMEX> in the set of differentially expressed
        genes. As a result, valuable clues could emerge as to the
        dominant biological features or processes that might
        underlie the coordinate expression of these genes. Such
        clues could be especially convincing if it can be shown
        that the enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are unlikely to represent a
        chance occurrence. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> can be defined by common
        gene annotations or concepts from the biomedical
        literature.
      
      
        Results
        
          Global differences in gene expression between
          xenograft tumors and cell cultures
          A549 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U118</NUMEX> cells were each transplanted
          subcutaneously into the intrascapular region of
          immunodeficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, within which sizable tumors
          developed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX>. Global mRNA expression profiles
          from these tumors, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips, were
          compared with profiles obtained from the cell lines as
          grown in culture. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between the A549</TIMEX> xenograft tumors and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cultures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">375</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> significantly at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX> with a fold change
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> either way (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being higher in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being higher in culture), a number
          much greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> to be expected by chance, as
          determined by permutation testing. Between the U118
          xenograft tumors and cell cultures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">368</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">387</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>
          sets) differed significantly (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being higher in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being higher in culture), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          expected false positives due to chance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the
          genes with highest expression in tumors compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, for each of the cell lines.
          From histological analysis the amount of mouse tissue
          in a xenograft <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> was estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 10 and 20%</NUMEX>. To
          determine the extent of hybridization with the human
          HuGeneFL chip that might be attributable to mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, a
          sample of mouse lung tissue was also profiled. Whereas
          the total amount of hybridization measured in the
          xenograft tumor profiles was comparable to that of the
          culture profiles with equal amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hybridization</ENAMEX> measured in the mouse control profile was
          found to be about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> that of a xenograft profile,
          with the same amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. As the control profile was
          from a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> mouse tissue, the contribution of
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to differences observed in gene expression
          between cell cultures and tumors was considered to be
          minimal. From a comparison of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-set
          intensities of the mouse lung profile with those of the
          culture profiles, and assuming a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> contribution of
          mouse tissue to the human xenograft sample, we estimate
          that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 20</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,069</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> on the
          HuGeneFL chip (a number on the level of measurement noise
          in a microarray experiment) would the amount of
          hybridization from mouse tissue alone have been high
          enough to account for greater than twofold changes
          between cell cultures and tumors. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 800</NUMEX>
          probe sets showed a greater than twofold increase on
          average from A549 culture profiles to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> xenograft
          tumor profiles. It can therefore be concluded that, in
          all but a handful of genes, the numerous significant
          changes observed in gene expression in the xenograft
          tumors are due to the cancerous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>) cells and not the
          surrounding (mouse) host tissue.
          Principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> were extracted from the cell
          culture and xenograft expression data using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 7,069</NUMEX>
          probe sets considered in the analysis. The first
          principal component captures the greatest fraction of the
          overall variance in gene expression; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> captures
          the greatest fraction of variance subject to being
          independent of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and so on. From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          principal components, a pair of coordinates was
          determined for each xenograft and cell culture profile to
          construct a two-dimensional view that reflects the
          relative locations of the profiles in the
          higher-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. On the same two-dimensional
          view, we plotted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> profiles from lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> and another dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> profiles from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glioblastomas</ENAMEX> and astrocytomas, generated from previous
          global gene-expression studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Figure 1shows
          this principal components analysis (PCA) plot of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles from cell cultures, xenografts,
          and human lung and brain tumors. Although none of the
          human tumor profiles was used to define the principal
          components coordinate space, lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor profiles</ENAMEX> appear
          well separated on the plot from brain tumor profiles.
          A549 profiles (both xenograft and culture) are grouped
          with lung tumors rather than brain tumors, and U118
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX>, with brain tumors rather than lung tumors. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found expressed more highly in A549
          xenograft tumors over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> cultures ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> were also higher in stage I adenocarcinomas over A549
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U118</TIMEX> xenograft tumors over cultures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          were also higher in high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glioblastomas</ENAMEX> over U118
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Overrepresentation of genes involved in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> and metabolism among genes upregulated in cancer
          cells in culture relative to xenografts
          Searches were made for significantly enriched gene
          classes, as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) annotation or
          Medical Subject Heading Index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeSH</ENAMEX>) term association
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), for both the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes upregulated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> cell cultures over A549
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated in the U118
          cell cultures over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118</TIMEX> tumors ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>).
          In each case, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for the most enriched
          classes appeared highly significant compared to what
          would be expected, based on simulation results, in a
          randomly selected set of the same number of genes. For
          example, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> enriched
          LocusLink annotation terms were found that had a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.9E-03</TIMEX>, where
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> term with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.9E-03</TIMEX> would be
          expected in a given set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> randomly selected genes.
          Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> simulation tests, no single test had more than
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</TIMEX> terms with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.9E-03</TIMEX>. Table
          2shows the top gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> found in both the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> set
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U118</NUMEX> set with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. There are
          far more gene classes common to both gene sets with 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> in each than would be
          expected in two randomly selected gene sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> (for example, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">MeSH</ENAMEX> term classes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> were
          found to be significantly enriched in the actual data,
          whereas about two would be expected to occur by chance,
          see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Taken together, the significantly enriched classes
          found for both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> and the U118 genes in cell
          culture compared with tumors are highly indicative of
          processes of cell division and metabolism, with
          significant MeSH term classes for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene sets
          including 'Cell cycle' (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Mitochondria'</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38,52</NUMEX>), and 'Cyclin-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX>'
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21,30</NUMEX>); and significant GO terms including 'Cell
          proliferation' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36,39</NUMEX>), 'Metabolism' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">108,134</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Cytokinesis'</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8,6</NUMEX>), 'Tricarboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> cycle' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,5</NUMEX>),
          and 'G1/S transition' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,7</NUMEX>). A search for enriched gene
          classes was also made for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were expressed
          more highly ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.05</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>) in
          both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549 and U118</TIMEX> cell cultures over tumors, and the
          significant classes found were the same, or of the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. For the entire
          set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">enriched</NUMEX> classes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated in cell
          cultures over the xenograft tumors, including which genes
          belong to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, see Additional data files and [

          Overrepresentation of genes involved in cell
          adhesion, the extracellular matrix, and vascularization
          among genes upregulated in cancer cells in xenografts
          relative to cultures
          As with the genes expressed at higher levels in
          culture compared to xenografts, searches were made for
          significantly enriched GO and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">MeSH</ENAMEX> term classes for the
          set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with significantly higher expression ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>) in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> tumors over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> cell cultures and the set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118</TIMEX> tumors over the U118
          cell cultures. Again, in each case, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for the most enriched
          classes found were quite significant over what would be
          expected by chance. For example, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>
          genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> enriched MeSH terms were found that had a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7E-04</TIMEX>, where one
          term would be expected to have 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 7E</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">04</NUMEX> in a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>
          randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> simulation tests, no
          single test had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six</TIMEX> terms with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7E-04</TIMEX>. Table
          3shows the top gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> found in both the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> set
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U118</NUMEX> set with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
          Taken together, the significantly enriched gene
          classes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> and U118 genes that were upregulated in
          tumors compared to cell culture are highly indicative of
          processes involving cell adhesion and the extracellular

          in xenografts
          While several gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were found in common
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U118</TIMEX> tumors and the

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> upregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were shared between the two

          genes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over four</NUMEX> times the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> expected by chance) were
          common to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> cultures and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>).
          Whereas processes of cell division and metabolism may be
          more in common from one <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to the next, processes of
          cell adhesion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> interaction are likely to be very
          different between different cell types. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> gave rise to the hypothesis that, when
          placed in comparable tissue environments, cancer cells
          from different lineages may express different cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and ECM-related genes.
          To test our hypothesis that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U118</NUMEX> cells
          each express a restricted set of ECM-related genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, we built a classifier for distinguishing between
          A549 and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-culture profiles. We used as the
          training dataset <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549 and U118</TIMEX> tumor profiles with
          the expression values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that had both an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> in the literature with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">MeSH</ENAMEX> term
          'Extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix proteins</ENAMEX>' and were significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>)
          either in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> xenograft tumors over cultures or in U118
          tumors over cultures. We then tested the classifier on
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> profiles from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549 and U118</TIMEX> cell cultures. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classifier</ENAMEX> distinguished perfectly between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> and U118
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX>, which indicates that the expression pattern of
          ECM-related genes upregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> tumors is more
          similar to the expression pattern of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cultures than it is to the expression of
          these genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118</TIMEX> cell cultures, and vice versa. We
          built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other similar classifiers: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used the
          expression values of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are significantly
          higher in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> or U118 tumors and had an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">MeSH</ENAMEX> term 'Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adhesion</ENAMEX>'; the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> used the values for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> associated with 'Cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>'; and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> used the expression
          values of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">236</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> or U118 tumors
          with 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.01</NUMEX> and fold change
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> classifiers correctly
          distinguished between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549 and U118</TIMEX> cell cultures. Figure
          2shows a cluster diagram of the expression signatures of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion-related genes across all profiles,
          showing most of the genes as appearing more highly
          expressed in either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> tumors or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118</TIMEX> tumors,
          but not in both.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Cells grown in culture have unlimited access to
        nutrients under conditions most favorable for growth and
        proliferation and little exposure to extrinsic factors such
        as cytokines that modulate growth and differentiation. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in a tumor growing in a host tissue
        environment face conditions with more limited nutrients and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and are subjected to or benefit from a wide variety
        of host factors. The ability of cancer cells to proliferate
        within a tissue depends on their response to adhesive and
        growth factor cues within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and
        self-sufficiency in growth signals is one of the hallmarks
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . To stimulate their own growth and
        proliferation in tissue, tumor cells can overproduce and
        release their own growth factors or obtain them from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> as they are released by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix metalloproteinases</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . The endothelial vasculature grows into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and
        provides nutrients and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the experimental results presented here, as
        both A549 (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U118</TIMEX> (brain) cell lines are observed
        to upregulate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of genetic programs related to cell
        growth and proliferation when in culture and another set
        related to cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix, growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, and neovascularization when developing as an 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>.
        In terms of new biological insight into cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, our findings suggest that cancer cells of
        different origins interact in different ways with the same
        extracellular environment to survive and proliferate as
        tumors. These lineage-specific genetic programs for cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> interaction, although less active in cell
        culture, are not lost, but may be reactivated when cells
        are transplanted back into an 
        in vivo environment, even if the new
        environment is different from the tissue of origin of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. This conclusion is based on the significant
        representation of genes associated with cell adhesion and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both the A549 and the U118</TIMEX> xenograft tumors.
        However, the genes in each case represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very distinct
        sets, the set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118</TIMEX> tumors being more similar in
        their expression pattern to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of the U118</TIMEX> cell cultures
        than to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cultures, and vice versa.
        Although tumors are known to express high levels of
        genes involved in cell adhesion and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>, as we observed
        in the xenografts, assessment of the specific contribution
        of cancer cells to the increased expression may be
        difficult. In the case of human tumor xenografts in a mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, however, it can be determined conclusively that
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECM genes</ENAMEX> is upregulated in
        the cancerous cells in the tumor tissue. This conclusion is
        based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following two</TIMEX> observations. First, profiling
        mouse tissue alone using probe sets designed for human
        genes gives poor hybridization, to the extent that the
        contribution from mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would not have been enough to
        account for the differences in gene expression observed.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, different cell adhesion and ECM-related genes are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in tumors of different cell types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> versus
        U118); if the upregulation were due to a common mouse
        source, then the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> should have appeared
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in both cell types, given that the cells were
        grown in the same site.
        The findings presented here, suggesting that different
        ECM signaling pathways are active in different <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>,
        could have important clinical implications, as knowledge of
        the specific pathways dysregulated in a particular cancer
        may be valuable for devising effective therapy that targets
        those pathways. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for further investigation, we
        have identified genes that appear upregulated in certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cancers</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo compared to 
        in vitro and that belong to distinct
        functional classes related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor progression</ENAMEX>. Also of
        interest are genes that are upregulated in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, including 
        IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binding protein 3</ENAMEX>), which, interestingly, is thought to
        have proapoptotic activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSN</ENAMEX> (gelsolin), which has a role in
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motility</ENAMEX> and acts as both a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> and effector
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Further xenograft studies of the type
        presented here could examine the responses of the host
        tissue to the tumor (using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> microarray chip), as
        well as temporal changes in gene expression within the
        developing tumor.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cell lines and tumors
          Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line and the
          U118 brain glioblastoma cell line were cultured at 37°C
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -humidified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> in DMEM
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 U/ml</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penicillin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX> streptomycin. The cells were
          passaged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> upon reaching confluence. We produced
          tumors in immunodeficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCID C.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-17</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by inoculating
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6cells (either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U118</NUMEX>) subcutaneously per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> in the intrascapular region. Tumors greater than 5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mm</ENAMEX> in diameter (range = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> mm) were observed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice inoculated</ENAMEX>. The tumors were
          harvested under sterile conditions and trimmed of adipose
          and connective tissue. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from tumor
          tissue.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiling
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three A549</TIMEX> xenograft tumors obtained from different

          cell-culture samples, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> U118 culture samples were
          each profiled using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> microarray chips
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA), which consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,069</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>, each representing an mRNA transcript. To
          assess the amount of hybridization with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip
          (designed for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX>) that could be attributable to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse mRNA</ENAMEX> in a xenograft tumor sample, a sample of mouse
          lung tissue was also profiled. Preparation of mRNA,
          hybridization of the arrays, and computation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-set
          intensities were as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 16 17</ENAMEX> ] .
          The exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set controls on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that give constant hybridization from sample
          to sample) were used to determine scaling factors for
          comparing the mouse lung profile with the xenograft and
          culture profiles. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, we computed the
          fold changes for human cell-line cultures (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U118 and A549</TIMEX>)
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> mouse lung compared to the pure cell line, using
          the expression (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX> × [human] + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> × [<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>])/[human].
          This assessed the potential impact of mouse tissue on
          differences observed between xenograft <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and
          cell-culture profiles.
          As criteria for determining significant differences in
          mean gene mRNA expression levels between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          samples, we used both a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> using the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test and a fold change greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> either way. Probe-set intensities <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX>
          were set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>. Permutation testing was used to assess
          the number of genes that could be considered significant
          for any arbitrary separation of the profiles into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Hierarchical clustering, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eisen</ENAMEX> software
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] , was applied using the average linkage method
          as an aid to visualizing gene-expression patterns of
          interest. Global views of the variation in gene
          expression among cell specimens were obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Significantly enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> within gene

          For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> set of genes showing significant

          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . For the entire set of genes profiled
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip, each gene was grouped into one or
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> as defined by one of the following criteria:
          a common <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) annotation term, where on the
          order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> terms were considered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ; and a
          common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">MeSH</ENAMEX> literature term [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> as defined
          below. GO term gene assignments related to categories of
          'biological process' or 'molecular function' were
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LocusLink</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] and the GO term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hierarchy</ENAMEX> was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology Consortium</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . For each GO term assigned to a given gene in
          LocusLink, we also assigned all hierarchical parent terms
          of the term to the gene.
          For each gene profiled in the study, the summaries of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> most recent articles that mention the gene by any
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its common aliases in the article abstract were
          downloaded from the web, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entrez</ENAMEX> utilities
          (described at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ). An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was then made
          between the gene and any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeSH</ENAMEX> index terms included within
          those summaries. To reduce search time and spurious or
          uninteresting results, before searching for common MeSH
          term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> we first reviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeSH</ENAMEX> terms
          downloaded for the entire set of genes profiled. We
          removed from further consideration any MeSH term that
          appeared to have no relevance to our study (for example,
          MeSH terms describing experimental protocols or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> system). MeSH terms that were associated with
          fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were also discarded, leaving some
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> MeSH terms that were considered in the analysis.
          Similarly, GO gene classes that applied to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than four</NUMEX>
          of the genes under study were not considered.
          For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> significant genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate
          searches were made for enriched GO term classes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeSH</ENAMEX>
          term classes. For a given gene class common to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> set, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> applied to a
          total of 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> out of the entire set of 
          G unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> under study, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">probability,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> , for the term occurring 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> or more times within a set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> genes randomly selected from the
          chip was calculated using the one-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact
          test. As multiple gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were tested for our set of
          genes of interest, the true significance of a low 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value for an enriched class was
          estimated using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo simulation</ENAMEX>
          tests. For each test 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were first randomly
          selected from the set of 
          G genes, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for the classes occurring
          within the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were then
          calculated. For a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> found in
          the original 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> set of genes, we calculated the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> that could be expected to have a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value as low or lower in a set
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> randomly selected genes, based on
          the simulation results. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> found to be
          represented in two given sets, one with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the other with 
          l genes, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> in both
          cases, we calculated on the basis of simulation results
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> expected to be found in both a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>- gene set and a random 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX> -gene set with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> in both.
          In this case, we carried out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> simulation tests, in
          each of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and another set of 
          l genes were each randomly selected
          from the entire set of 
          G <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> under study. For each gene
          class that was found to be represented in both random
          gene sets, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for enrichment were
          calculated for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets.
        
        
          Classification of cell-line lineage based on gene
          expression
          In order to determine whether the lineage, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> or
          U118, of a given cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> could be predicted on
          the basis of its gene-expression profile, we built a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classifier</ENAMEX> using a training set of profiles with a set of
          genes of interest to be used as markers. To classify a
          test sample as either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U118</TIMEX>, we computed the
          correlation coefficient between the expression values of
          the markers in the test sample profile and the same genes
          on each of the profiles in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> (using
          log-transformed values). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> identity of the
          majority of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> training profiles having the
          greatest correlation with the test profile was then
          assigned to that profile. This strategy is known in the
          classification literature as "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> with
          majority voting" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
