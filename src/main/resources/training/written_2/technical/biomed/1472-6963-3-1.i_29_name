          Origins of PRWORA
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> moved to reform public spending
          by reducing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> on welfare rolls.
          Reforms focused partly on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, following testimony
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> estimating that
          slightly more than half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplemental Security</ENAMEX>
          Income (SSI) benefits provided to elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were
          collected by noncitizens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justifying PRWORA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> stated that it had been a basic tenet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
          immigration policy since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> that legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
          should not be eligible for public benefits. Though
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did not rescind emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> from illegal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immigrants</ENAMEX>, the legislation cited "a compelling
          government interest to remove the incentive for illegal
          immigration provided by the availability of public
          benefits" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> was among several pieces of
          legislation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> - including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Proposition 187</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illegal Immigration</ENAMEX>
          Reform and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 [ 16</ENAMEX> ] -
          that embodied substantive immigration policy changes, the
          specific provisions of which have been enforced in
          varying degrees according to government priorities.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> legislation and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' responses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> made several key reforms restricting public
          assistance for qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Prior to the
          implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>, "qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>" were
          eligible for the same federal means-tested benefits as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> makes an important distinction between
          "qualified" and "non-qualified" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. The term 
          qualified alien is used
          synonymously with 
          legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> and designates a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noncitizen</ENAMEX> who falls into one of the following
          categories: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> lawfully admitted for permanent
          residence; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> granted asylum; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons paroled</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> for whom deportation is being withheld;
          and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> granted conditional entry. The term 
          non-qualified alien includes
          nonimmigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">undocumented</ENAMEX>/illegal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>.
          After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>, legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> were declared
          ineligible for nonemergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> for their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with some exceptions, as described
          later. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>)
          estimates that there were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.5 million (Â± 350000</NUMEX>) legal
          permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> residing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . To qualify for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> coverage
          after the ban, noncitizens must not receive public
          benefits during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5-year period</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Legal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> receiving benefits at the time of enactment on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22, 1996</TIMEX>, were denied continuation of those
          benefits starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1997</TIMEX>. Benefits both before
          and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> for 
          non-qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> remained
          restricted to emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>.
          Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> did not consider immigration
          status in granting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> assistance. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>,
          however, most legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> arriving after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1996</TIMEX>
          were barred from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> and other state-funded
          assistance, at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' discretion. Exceptions were made
          for (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> granted asylum and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
          whose deportation was being withheld; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) armed forces
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> and their dependent family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>;
          and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) legal permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> qualifying
          quarters of work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          Under pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>'
          advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> restored some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> benefits
          to certain legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balanced</ENAMEX>
          Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> (BBA) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Under the BBA, a
          legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> could qualify for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> (not
          restricted to emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>) through SSI eligibility
          if he or she was lawfully in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and
          receiving SSI benefits on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22, 1996</TIMEX>, and
          subsequently certified under the SSI program as blind or
          disabled.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Immigrant populations</ENAMEX> and use of health care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noncitizens</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> numbered
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 percent</NUMEX> of the
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Previous research has shown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncitizens</ENAMEX> to be more economically disadvantaged and to
          possess lower levels of health insurance than naturalized
          and native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> data suggest that noncitizens
          are more likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to be poor (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>),
          despite the fact that noncitizen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are as likely
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen families</ENAMEX> to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> full-time worker
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In their report on insurance rates
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Fund Task Force</ENAMEX>
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Future of Health Insurance</ENAMEX> found that the longer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> had been permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, the more likely they were to be covered by
          employer-related insurance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Among low-income
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uninsured</ENAMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Commission</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> may
          underutilize health care regardless of insurance
          coverage, out of fear of jeopardizing their citizenship
          eligibility by incurring costs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> charges [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Objective
          Using data from several sources, we present snapshots
          of information currently available, and consider how the
          financial impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> might be
          estimated. Based on a review of relevant literature, we
          hypothesized that uncompensated hospital care would be
          more prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with lower rates of health
          insurance coverage, higher percentages of foreign-born
          residents (used to approximate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of interest
          affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>), higher rates of poverty, and greater
          percentages of teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . We
          outline the limitations of available data and discuss
          what information is needed to accurately estimate the
          outcome of interest.
        
      
      
        Methods
        Our goal was to examine the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> on
        hospital uncompensated care expenditures. The analysis
        consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts: a series of "data snapshots" to
        describe relevant information, and a multivariable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> to model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> of uncompensated care costs.
        The regression analysis was conducted at the state level
        because no single source of data includes both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        immigration status and the amount of uncompensated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        care provided, thus precluding hospital- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-level
        analyses.
        We collected the following state-level data for the
        period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 through 1999</TIMEX>: foreign-born, noncitizen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; health uninsurance rates; percentage of
        teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> as a proportion of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        reporting data per <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; and each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s decision
        regarding whether to implement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA Medicaid</ENAMEX> bar for
        legal permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> or to continue offering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonemergency Medicaid</ENAMEX> coverage using state-only funds.
        These factors are thought to influence expenditures per
        admission for uncompensated hospital care [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX>
        ] and were examined at the state level for the period from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 to 1999</TIMEX> for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> observations (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>).
        State-level data on the percentage of the population
        uninsured and the percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comprised of
        foreign-born noncitizens were obtained from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
        Current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population Survey</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Supplement</ENAMEX>, a detailed
        description of which is available elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program covers virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
        aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 and older</TIMEX>, data on insurance coverage rates among
        nonelderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were used. As the closest available
        proxy for the percentage of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, we
        used the "foreign born, not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>" category
        available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Basic Monthly Survey</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
        State-level poverty data were obtained from the
        historical poverty tables of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Poverty thresholds are stable across all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and are
        adjusted for inflation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> using the Consumer Price
        Index for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All Urban Consumers</ENAMEX> (CPI-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>).
        Aggregate data on uncompensated care were obtained from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Hospital Association</ENAMEX>'s (AHA) nationwide Annual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey of Hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHA</ENAMEX> defines bad debt as the
        provision for actual or expected uncollectibles resulting
        from the extension of credit. Charity care services,
        however, are provided free of charge to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who
        meet certain financial criteria and are never expected to
        result in cash inflows. Total uncompensated care for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> on the state level was estimated as the sum of
        bad debt and charity care. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, we obtained a
        sample of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for which both charity care and bad
        debt data were available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 to 1999</TIMEX>. We
        calculated uncompensated care per hospital admission as a
        per capita estimate of uncompensated care. These estimates
        were adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1999 US dollars</NUMEX> using the medical care
        component of the CPI.
        Teaching hospital status also was obtained from the AHA
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> Survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospitals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHA</ENAMEX> defines teaching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> as those that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teaching Hospitals of the Association of American Medical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Colleges</ENAMEX>. Teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> percentage refers to the
        percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> classified as teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        out of the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in a state reporting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of interest.
        Although every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX>, chose to preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> coverage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
        who were eligible before the enactment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
        entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22, 1996</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>'
        decisions varied on whether to implement the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> bar on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> eligibility for qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> after the
        enactment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>) maintained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>
        eligibility for qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22, 1996</TIMEX>, through state-only funds [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        ] . We included a dichotomous variable in the model
        describing each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s implementation decision.
        A multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the
        hypothesis that total uncompensated care (the sum of
        charity care and bad debt) per admission would be affected
        by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s percentage of foreign-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, poverty
        rate, uninsurance rate, percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s implementation decision. Because total
        uncompensated care was heavily skewed, we used a
        log-transformed variable as the dependent variable. The
        resulting log-linear model has the convenient property of
        measuring the relative change in the dependent variable
        (uncompensated care) for an absolute change in a given
        predictor variable, controlling for other predictors in the
        model. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 through 1999</TIMEX> was entered into

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regression</ENAMEX> model
          Exploratory analyses showed that uninsurance was
          highly correlated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s poverty rate ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.70</NUMEX>). In addition, percentage
          foreign-born and percentage teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were
          highly correlated ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>). To avoid collinearity
          and create a more robust model, poverty rate was dropped
          from the final multivariable regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>; percentage
          of teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> was dichotomized, assigning a value
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> or more teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Both
          the dependent variable - uncompensated care per admission
          - and percentage foreign-born were used in log form due
          to nonnormal distributions revealed in exploratory
          analyses.
          Results of the multivariable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> modeling
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) suggest that, controlling for time and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s foreign-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, percentage of teaching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and implementation decision, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> increase in
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s uninsured population yields a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1%</NUMEX> increase in
          the amount of uncompensated care provided ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). Controlling for all
          other variables, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> increase in the log of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
          foreign-born population yields a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX> increase in
          uncompensated care, though this result was only
          significant at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> level. Percentage of teaching
          hospitals <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 5%</NUMEX> was found to be a weak
          predictor of uncompensated care, but was not significant
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.601</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s decision to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implement PRWORA</ENAMEX> did not independently predict
          uncompensated care expenditures in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The trend
          variables corresponding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> were not
          significant.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> marked large-scale changes in health,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX>, and welfare policy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> have
        all had a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>'s enactment. An accurate monetary
        estimate of the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> on hospital uncompensated
        care due to changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> coverage would be useful to
        policymakers as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> periodically comes up for
        consideration of renewal, and as anecdotal evidence of an
        adverse financial impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> continues to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mount</ENAMEX>.
        We hypothesized that hospital uncompensated care
        expenditures would be greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with higher
        percentages of foreign-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, lower rates of
        insurance coverage, and higher percentages of teaching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Measured at the state level, hospital
        uncompensated care expenditures were not statistically
        significantly related to percentage foreign-born,
        percentage of teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' implementation
        decisions; in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, higher uninsurance rates emerged
        as the only significant predictor of uncompensated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        care expenditures. This finding suggests that efforts to
        reduce the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uninsured or underinsured would
        reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>' expenditures on uncompensated care. This
        implication reinforces claims that high rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uninsurance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> have negative effects, but
        does not directly address our original hypothesis about the
        immigrant eligibility provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>. As with other
        studies that have combined disparate data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to assess
        the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> on the health or welfare of would-be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , data limitations posed a significant
        challenge to these analyses.
        The proxy of percentage foreign-born may not have
        accurately captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of interest - legal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> arriving after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22, 1996</TIMEX>, who were no
        longer eligible for nonemergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> coverage. Using
        the foreign-born category from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> data relies on
        the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with higher foreign-born
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> would also have a greater number of legal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> whose eligibility for nonemergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>
        would be affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>. However, the foreign-born
        noncitizen category used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> data (defined as any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> not born a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naturalized</ENAMEX>) includes categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> exempted from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> cuts, such as asylum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>. Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> requires states that provide
        health services to report illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, it is unlikely that accurate data on
        immigration status and date of entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        can be collected in the health care setting. In addition,
        it is unlikely that any institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> would
        approve the collection of such data in present
        circumstances.
        Because the main effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> was to restrict
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> eligibility, thereby increasing demand for
        uncompensated care, the present analysis focused on
        state-level parameters linked to demand for medical care.
        Uncompensated care reimbursement pools, common in states
        with former all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> rate-setting systems, led to
        increased uncompensated care expenditures throughout the
        1990s. In a deregulated health care system, however, states
        tended to use these funds to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> managed care, thus shifting the focus of the pools
        to reimbursement for charity care only [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Because of
        the non-uniformity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' approaches to uncompensated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> pools, their limited use, and their changing roles
        over time, we did not include this factor in our final
        model.
        A monetary estimate on a national, state, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        level of the financial impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> remains difficult
        to ascertain due to data limitations. Ideally, such
        research would compare the costs before and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> of
        the nonemergency care that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> provided (both as
        charity care and as bad debt) to the category of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
        who lost nonemergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> eligibility due to the
        implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>. We would expect the extent and
        implications of this financial impact to vary according to
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> characteristics and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> served.
        Because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s immigration status is not recorded
        concomitantly with hospital resource use in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
        state, or federal database, it is not currently possible to
        isolate charity care and bad debt expenditures on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonreimbursed</ENAMEX> services for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose eligibility for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> has been changed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>.
        An additional complicating factor is the possibility
        that, as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may provide and bill
        for services as emergency services that previously were
        categorized as nonemergency services in order to secure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> payment. Similarities in income-related
        eligibility criteria for emergency and nonemergency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> would facilitate reclassification. Further
        research should examine the extent to which providers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reclassify</ENAMEX> services.
        Traditionally, safety net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have been supported
        though public funds, such as disproportionate-share
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> (DSH) payments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> DSH payment is based
        on the assumption that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, in addition to
        providing care to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> enrollees, also serve indigent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who are ineligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>. However, there are
        some indications that public support mechanisms to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may be in jeopardy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSH</ENAMEX> payments
        are large and repeatedly become targets for budget cuts by
        federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. As a result of provisions in
        the BBA, for example, it has been estimated that federal
        spending on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid DSH</ENAMEX> will decrease by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>, during the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 through 2002</TIMEX>. Since
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> are being cared for in private
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>, public safety net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may be affected by
        both competition for fee-for-service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and decreases
        in overall DSH allotments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Finally, safety net
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> typically use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> revenues to help fund
        uncompensated care; decreases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> reimbursements
        may, therefore, further impede <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>' ability to
        provide services to the uninsured [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        Existing studies of trends in uncompensated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        care expenditures have focused primarily on supply-side
        covariates, such as uncompensated care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid DSH</ENAMEX> payments, and the degree of competition in the
        local health care marketplace [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 28 36 39 40</NUMEX> ] . While a
        focus on such hospital characteristics has helped to
        elucidate the factors that affect uncompensated care at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> level, the present study sought to examine the
        impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> legislation by identifying state-level
        characteristics affecting total hospital uncompensated care
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 to 1999</TIMEX>. Because data used for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> model came from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, comprehensive
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>-by<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year</TIMEX> figures from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 through 1999</TIMEX> were available
        for all factors in the model only at the state level.
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX> gave states the option of changing Medicaid

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, detailed hospital-specific information, at least
        at the level of metropolitan statistical area (MSA), would
        be needed on the immigration status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> served.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> limitations currently hamper efforts to obtain a
        monetary estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>' financial losses due
        specifically to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRWORA</ENAMEX>. To better quantify the impact of
        health policy regulations on health care providers, better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, particularly at the MSA level, are
        needed.
