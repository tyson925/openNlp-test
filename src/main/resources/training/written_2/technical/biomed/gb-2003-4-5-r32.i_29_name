        Recent reports describe the use of gene-expression
        profiling for the identification of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> of
        toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . This technique alone does not account
        for morphological changes in tissues that have
        traditionally been used by pathologists to discriminate
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and severity of toxicological responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . For a comprehensive approach to toxicological
        evaluation, we developed a unique methodology that uses
        histomorphometric profiles, derived from machine vision, in
        conjunction with gene-expression profiles, termed
        extensible morphometric relational gene-expression analysis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMeRGE</ENAMEX>). This novel method was evaluated on an
        established, extreme model of liver toxicity using carbon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrachloride</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ) in rats that were dosed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>
        and allowed to recover. Liver is relevant in toxicology as
        the primary organ of metabolism and detoxification; it is a
        recurrent target of chronic drug toxicity.
        A fully automated analytical microscope equipped with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machine-vision</ENAMEX> hardware and software was used to generate
        quantitative information about the structure and
        heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The histomorphometric profiles
        could be used to evaluate tissue heterogeneity across the
        tissue including regions of hepatocellular necrosis.
        Representative images of tissue sections from control and
        treated tissues are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Examples of
        processed sample image tiles are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, where a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> liver (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) can be compared to a treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), illustrating the significant structural
        damage induced by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles were
        generated from the same livers using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">microarrays</ENAMEX> measured mRNA transcription levels of genes
        important in adsorption, distribution, metabolism and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excretion</ENAMEX> (ADME). Previous studies of these genes,
        including markers of toxic stress, apoptosis, growth
        regulation and repair, were consistent with documented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicologic</ENAMEX> responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , where expression of components of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytochrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P450</ENAMEX> and other metabolic enzymes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cyp2C,</ENAMEX>
        Cyp3A18, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cyp3A9</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fmo1</ENAMEX>) were found to decrease,
        whereas certain genes involved in the inflammatory response
        and signal transduction were increased (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD44 and Lgals3</TIMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] .
        Previous studies relating gene expression to pathologic
        or tissue data have evaluated qualitative tissue
        information only [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , or focused on visually
        identified tissue subareas or specific cells isolated by by
        laser microdissection (LMD) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMD</ENAMEX>, specific
        cells from a sample are collected by interactively defining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of interest in a microscope image, which are excised
        by a laser for subsequent gene-expression analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMD</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjective</ENAMEX> and destructive to the specimen and has limited
        ability to account for tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heterogeneity</ENAMEX>. Progress in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> microscopy has allowed quantitative image analysis
        to generate data that objectively and completely describe
        tissue phenotype, free of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> disagreement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ,
        and with the potential to detect subtle changes that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> to the human eye [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Tissue
        histomorphometric profiles in EMeRGE are correlated
        statistically with gene-expression profiles, characterizing
        each sample through both top-down phenotypic information
        and complementary bottom-up genomic data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank
        order correlation determined significant monotonic
        relationships that illuminate important connections between
        structural features in tissue elements and genes that have
        been reported as significantly up- or downregulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> treatment in previous studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Principal component analysis (PCA), as described in
        Materials and methods, was carried out to reduce the
        complexity of the data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and then to relate individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to specific phenotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. A quadratic
        regression classifier was used to develop a scheme that
        defined treated and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three datasets</TIMEX>: gene
        expression, tissue feature and the combination of both.
        This method required no pre-selection or filtering of
        invariantly expressing genes to classify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as
        previously published. Although the classification ability
        was not improved when tissue features were added to gene
        expression, analysis of the combined data revealed
        different outlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> for each dataset, presenting a
        more complete picture of the damage and regeneration.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Correlation between tissue features and gene
          expression
          Relationships between gene expression and tissue
          features can be a deep source of information about toxin
          mechanism. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank order correlation (see
          Materials and methods), we tested for monotonic
          functional relationships between gene-expression values
          and tissue features. The numbers of significant
          correlations were determined at the following levels:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01 and 0.001</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These levels represent
          the cutoff probability of making a type I error, for
          example, the probability of determining that there exists
          a true correlation when in reality there is none.
          Genes that correlated with tissue features with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> or lower were
          chosen for additional inspection (see Additional data
          files). This analysis highlighted known markers of
          toxicity as well as many genes identified in previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> studies, most notably that for LRF-1
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M63282</NUMEX>), a known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of proliferation during liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> following injury, as well as the genes for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitronectin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U44845</NUMEX>) and Î± glutathione- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S -transferase Mu</ENAMEX> isoform (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U86635</NUMEX>)
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 16 17</ENAMEX> ] .
          A number of genes correlating with tissue features
          were distinct from those found by a twofold ratio
          analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Assessment of these genes revealed an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with the known or suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
          the biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity. Correlations with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          structural metrics were chosen for examination, providing
          a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: '<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space', <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">'area %</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX>' and 'vacuoles<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/mm 2</ENAMEX>'. The tissue metrics <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear
          space and area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles were negatively correlated with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> isoform of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cytochrome P450 (3A9:U46118,</ENAMEX>
          2B12:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X63545 and 2B3</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M20406</ENAMEX>), this may be a hallmark of
          recovery. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gene common to clear-space-related metrics
          (non-stained tissue, including vacuoles and hydrophic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±-tubulin</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V01227</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tubulin</ENAMEX> levels do
          not change during the acute phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> poisoning, but have been shown to
          decrease in association with the development of fatty
          liver tissue as a result of chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exposure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . In the present
          study, tubulin was positively correlated with the three
          components of clear space, perhaps indicating cellular
          reorganization. Also strongly correlated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          clear-space metrics was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> -adenosylmethionine synthetase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X60822</NUMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AdoMet synthetase</NUMEX>). A suppression of AdoMet
          synthetase activity has been observed in a model of
          acetaminophen toxicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The negative correlation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdoMet</ENAMEX> synthetase mRNA observed in the present study
          suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity suppresses message as well,
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdoMet</ENAMEX> synthetase was most significantly correlated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space.
          Expression of distintegrin metalloprotease (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Z48444</NUMEX>)
          was positively correlated with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two vacuole</NUMEX>-related
          metrics. This is an ADAM10-homolog known to be a tumor
          necrosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î±</ENAMEX> (TNFÎ±) convertase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , TNFÎ±
          produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kupffer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> stimulates
          production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, a mitogen for hepatocytes helping to
          generate new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> needed to rebuild damaged areas of the
          liver [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Kupffer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have a significant role as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of acute inflammation after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> treatment; however, they also
          produce factors that can cause secondary injury in the
          liver through fibrogenic responses. An increase in a TNFÎ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convertase</ENAMEX> would ensure that any residual cytokine
          present would be in the active stimulatory form. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and
          its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, along with interleukin-6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>) and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, were both upregulated in the present study, but
          neither was correlated with a tissue metric below the
          0.01 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value threshold.
          Different spectra of cytokines are associated with
          toxicity or inflammation compared to tissue repair. In
          the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding many different
          cytokines were affected; however, not all were
          significantly correlated with the tissue metrics examined
          in this analysis. A striking exception was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). The role of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> in the recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">necrotic liver</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> treatment has been well established
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Here, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> isoforms were found to
          correlate with clear-space-related metrics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isoforms</ENAMEX> B
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF022952 and AF014827</TIMEX>) were positively correlated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space itself, whereas isoform <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF010302</NUMEX>)
          was negatively correlated with both area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vacuoles/mm 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF Ch</ENAMEX> was reported to be involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer metastasis</ENAMEX> and tumor-cell invasion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] ,
          whereas isoforms B and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> are believed to have roles in
          proliferation and tissue remodeling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] ,
          highlighting the diverse roles of these cytokines. VEGF
          mRNA peaks at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kupffer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, whereas
          it peaks at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> in hepatocytes, well after necrosis
          has resolved and when vascular and sinusoidal endothelial
          cells are reappearing in the tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 31</NUMEX> ] .
          Correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> isoforms with specific tissue metrics
          suggests they have different roles in the regeneration
          and revascularization of severely damaged areas of the
          treated livers.
          Both the heat-stable enterotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M55636</NUMEX>) and
          contrapsin-like protease inhibitor CPi-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D00753</NUMEX>)
          correlated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space and area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enterotoxin</ENAMEX> receptor, which is a marker for regeneration
          in both partial hepatectomy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , was positively
          correlated with these tissue metrics, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CP1-26</ENAMEX> was
          negatively correlated. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPI-3</ENAMEX> has been shown to be a
          downstream target of both the inflammatory acute-phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Positive correlation
          with an intermediate conductance calcium-activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMIK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF190458</NUMEX>) was common to the
          metrics related to vacuole density, area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vacuoles/mm 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> treatment perturbs the balance of
          many serum electrolytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , and an increase in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMIK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> might help re-establish normal potassium
          homeostasis as the liver recovers from the toxic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
          Correlations between genes and tissue metrics may
          reveal interesting differences similar to
          histomorphometric findings. For example, the vacuolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metrics</ENAMEX> (area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles and vacuoles<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/mm 2</ENAMEX>) have genes
          uniquely correlated with each, demonstrating a potential
          genetic basis for the difference between the number and
          size of vacuoles and their density, or packing. Vacuole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> was linked to the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wee1</ENAMEX> tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D31838</NUMEX>) and a nuclear co-repressor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF059311</NUMEX>) as
          well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-12</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AJ011299 and AF083329</TIMEX>), all
          involved in cell-cycle regulation and signaling. In
          contrast, area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles was linked to expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX> regulatory factor 1 (IRF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M34253</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IRF-1</ENAMEX> has
          been reported to be upregulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . The correlation between this cytokine and area %
          vacuoles but not with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vacuoles</ENAMEX>/mm <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2shows the</NUMEX> dynamic
          balance between the primary response to injury and tissue
          proliferation and repair. This illustrates how genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with each metric could help define molecular
          factors behind complex cellular mechanisms.
          In this study, the toxic injury visible on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 4</TIMEX> was
          subsequently reversed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 7 and 14</TIMEX>, with decreasing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impairment</ENAMEX> indicated by the levels of expression of
          metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 14</TIMEX>, there was a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">%</ENAMEX>
          clear space in livers from treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> whereas the
          other metrics - area <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> vacuoles and vacuoles<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/mm 2-</ENAMEX>
          remained consistent over time (data not shown). These
          findings hint at the important role of genes correlated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space in the balance between toxicity,
          repair and proliferation occurring in treated livers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> and classification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> was used to reduce the complexity in the gene,
          tissue and combined profiles of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat liver</ENAMEX>. From
          these analyses, we determined the principal component
          that identified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          principal component of the gene-expression data separated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from all others, including the
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> -treated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 7 and 14</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> component separates the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
          for the tissue-only data (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>), and both the first
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> components track the differences
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the combined datasets (Figure
          3c).
          Using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>, we
          classified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in treated day-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> versus control
          and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using a quadratic regression classifier
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> datasets. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cross-validation</ENAMEX> estimate of
          the probability of successful classification of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was used to determine the diagnostic strength of
          each type of dataset. Each step of the cross-validation
          calculated the appropriate principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> for all
          but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> animal to determine the parameters of the
          quadratic regression classifier, and then the remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was classified. This was repeated so that every
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">observed animal</ENAMEX> was left out and classified. The
          resulting schema can identify which <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          correctly classified or misclassified. With this method
          we were able to estimate the accuracy of developing a
          well-defined classification method. In practice, the
          discrimination rule would be created on a training set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and applied to an unknown set; therefore a high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-validation</ENAMEX> probability of successful classification
          for developing a well-defined discrimination rule is
          important.
          This analysis was carried out on gene expression and
          tissue features separately and on the combined dataset.
          Using gene-expression data only, the correct
          classification probability was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.43%</NUMEX>. Using the
          tissue-feature data, correct classification was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92.86%</NUMEX>.
          Finally, using the combined data, accuracy for correct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.43%</NUMEX>. The strong correlations
          between tissue features and genes allowed for the
          prediction of the tissue metrics from the gene dataset
          but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the tissue-feature data; note that
          this is due to the fact that it is easier to predict <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          tissue metrics from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than vice versa.
          Therefore, inclusion of tissue data in the combined set
          did not necessarily improve the classification using just
          the gene-expression data. Comparing the misclassified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from both sets, however, revealed differences for
          genes compared to tissue features. These differences can
          be used for diagnostic purposes by comparing the
          classification of outlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and to examine more
          closely the underlying components in both the molecular
          and phenotypic response to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>.
          The introduction of robust machine-vision techniques
          that can consistently discern the histomorphology of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> in a comprehensive fashion will support
          pathologic assessments allowing a more quantitative
          evaluation of phenotypic responses to compounds.
          Investigations can be carried out in an automated<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
          unsupervised fashion necessary for high-throughput
          analyses. The EMeRGE method demonstrated correlations
          between specific genes and tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that can
          augment interpretation of biological observations and
          diagnosis. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX> illustrate a new paradigm
          that phenotypically anchors changes in gene expression to
          structural features in tissue. Improved outlier detection
          may be attained with a combination of gene-expression and
          tissue phenotypic data. The improved objectivity and
          reproducibility of phenotypic assessments correlated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data is a step forward in tissue analysis
          that will impact on the definition of therapeutic margins
          and help refine dose levels, as well as improve
          identification of atypical responses. Other covariants
          such as clinical chemistry parameters can be added to
          this analysis for an even deeper view [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Combined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMeRGE</ENAMEX>, can be applied to any
          experimental or pathologic conditions where gene
          expression and tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">histology</ENAMEX> are integral to the
          interpretation of toxic or pharmacologic events as well
          as to the pathophysiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> -treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was dosed

          tissues were harvested for analysis. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobe</ENAMEX> of
          each liver was harvested at necropsy, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX>
          g was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIzol</ENAMEX> reagent according to the protocol from
          Gibco-BRL. The remaining liver fraction was fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>

          Sample preparation, hybridization and
          scanning
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was quantified and assessed for quality on a
          Bioanalyzer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> chip (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agilent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA). Each chip
          contains a set of interconnected gel-filled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that
          enables molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sieving</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>.
          Pin-electrodes in the chip create electrokinetic forces
          that drive molecules through these microchannels and
          carry out electrophoretic separations. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>
          peaks are measured by fluorescence signal and displayed
          in an electropherogram. A successful total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample
          featured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal peaks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">28S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-strand cDNA was prepared, labeled and processed as

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ADME</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> bioarray system and data
          preparation
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola CodeLinkâ¢ ADME Rat Bioarray</ENAMEX> consists of
          1,137 oligonucleotide probes corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX>
          unique clusters and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> control probes, selected from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank Rodent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RefSeq</ENAMEX> build number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>. Each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          base-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is was spotted in triplicate. All
          samples were hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> microarrays resulting in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> data points per probe.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola CodeLinkâ¢ Analysis Software</ENAMEX> gives an
          integrated optical density (IOD) value for every spot; a
          unique background value for that spot is subtracted,
          resulting in 'raw' data points.
        
        
          Histomorphometric profiling
          The remaining portion of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobe</ENAMEX> was fixed in
          formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼m</ENAMEX>) and
          stained with hematoxylin and eosin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&E</ENAMEX>). An
          automated analytical microscope system (ARTISâ¢,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TissueInformatics</ENAMEX>) was used to scan the entire slide at a
          low resolution to identify tissue locations. The smallest
          possible rectangular region fully encompassing each
          tissue section was captured at a high resolution at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.64</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Î¼m</ENAMEX>/pixel on a tile-by-tile basis, generating <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-400</ENAMEX>
          individual digital image tiles per slide. Each individual
          image tile was automatically focused, captured,
          digitized, corrected for shading and analyzed.
          The methodology was developed for image segmentation
          and trained for object classification using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of images from controls and treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat liver specimen</ENAMEX> from various studies, before the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was applied the specimen of this study. As a
          precursor to any segmentation operation the input <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-bit</NUMEX>
          RGB images of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E</ENAMEX>-prepared tissue were converted
          using a stain space conversion, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>. This
          technique effectively allowed each pixel in the image to
          be mapped to its respective stain-absorption value to
          give an invariant representation of the histologic
          properties of the image. Once the stain value at each
          pixel was determined, a generalized grouping was used to
          account for regional features, such as nuclei, which bind
          the stain. Similar high-level segmentation accounted for
          other object types within the tissue - namely clear
          space, vacuoles, sinusoids and cytoplasmic material -
          that generally tend to absorb (or not absorb) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of
          stain.
          Hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX> of the volume
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count. They vary in
          shape and texture (both in nuclei and cytoplasm) from one
          liver zone to another. Conditions such as hyperplasia and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> and other metabolic conditions may affect the
          appearance of nuclei and the surrounding cytoplasm as a
          result of tissue injury.
          Definition of the invariant characteristics of hepatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> made a robust segmentation possible and included
          the following features. Hepatic nuclei have a dark-blue
          appearance as a result of the absorption of hematoxylin.
          They may contain nucleoli, or chromatin figures internal
          to the nuclei. This will be exhibited as a conic boundary
          with a clear internal structure highlighted by dark
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. They are generally round or polyhedral in
          shape. They will have a general size boundary (correlated
          to the image capture magnification); variance will exist
          between each layer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. They are highlighted
          from the background tissue by the differential stain
          properties of hematoxylin, offsetting nuclear material
          from the surrounding cytoplasm.
          For classification, a probability model was used where
          each pixel expressing hematoxylin stain contains a vector
          of attributes that denotes the probability of the pixel
          belonging to a nucleus object. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidate objects</ENAMEX> can be
          readily found by locating local maxima in the
          hematoxylin-stained image (expressed as a ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin with a spatial filter applied to
          reduce noise). The vector is composed of elements such as
          stain-value deviation, size, shape, and texture
          measurements of internally visible chromatin and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoli</ENAMEX>. Proper values for these vectors were learned by
          a simple neural network model and used to classify
          objects into appropriate categories (for example, hepatic
          nucleus or non-hepatic nucleus). At times, representative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of this vector were misleading, because of
          artifacts in histology preparation and sectioning. These
          errors were resolved by applying pre-filtering to each
          vector element before comparison with the neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
          For example, nuclei with a 'half-moon' silhouette caused
          by the sectioning process will be misleading. In this
          case, fitting a polygon to the boundary and extracting
          hull-properties for the classification can make a solid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>.
          Once the non-hepatic nuclei <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> were separated
          from the surrounding tissue, they were differentiated
          further by applying spatial characteristics derived from
          the architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. Both size and eccentricity
          acted as a differentiator, as well as encapsulation by or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nearness</ENAMEX> to sinusoids (clear space). These rules were
          fairly invariant and had proved robust in validation
          protocols graded by pathologists on how well a feature
          was discriminated. The cellular architecture of the liver
          allowed for robust training data to be automatically
          characterized by the system. Objects were assigned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'rankings'</ENAMEX> of their probability of belonging to a given
          class plotted against spatial relationships, allowing for
          quick identification and correction of errors; for
          example, an object classified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kupffer</ENAMEX> nucleus (other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleus</ENAMEX>) should not exist outside of a certain proximity
          to a sinusoid.
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> could be derived with
          similar morphometric comparisons utilizing simple
          pattern-recognition classifiers for optimal performance.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro</ENAMEX>- and macrovesicular change were detected by
          thresholding the resultant clear-space image (derived by
          calculating tissue pixels that do not contain stain) in
          the saturation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> and locating 'round' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.
          Similarly, performance was improved by localizing red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood cells</ENAMEX>, identified by strong eosin stain band
          expression, to oblong white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>, as they are
          typically found in intrasinusoidal space.
          All nuclei were then masked out of the original tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mask</ENAMEX>, and clear-space areas were identified by performing
          an automatic threshold in the intensity band of the
          masked image. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binary</ENAMEX> clear space areas were classified as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> or as general white space objects based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circularity</ENAMEX> and size. A texture measure was developed,
          based on a gradient-filtered image, as an indicator of
          fine spatial changes in the cytoplasm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The
          cytoplasm of control livers had a smooth and uniform
          appearance, compared to that of treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, which
          exhibits more roughness, mainly caused by vacuoles.
          After training, the system was applied to the specimen
          of this study and all analytical steps were executed
          fully automatically and without further user interaction.
          The derived tissue metrics included hepatocyte and other
          nuclei, sinusoids, vacuoles including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX> of
          microvesicular change, counts of each feature per mm <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, %</ENAMEX>
          area of each feature respective to the total tissue area
          of each section, total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clear space (non-stained
          cellular and tissue elements), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> hematoxylin stained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objects</ENAMEX> (nuclei) and a texture feature. A reference set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> images was selected for validation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> images from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, control and treated, were
          randomly selected. The system used in this study was
          validated for the detection of basic tissue elements
          including hepatocyte nuclei, other nuclei, vacuoles and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sinusoids</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathologists</ENAMEX> independently inspected the
          classified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> indicated by colored overlays on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> images. Typically, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 250</NUMEX>-450
          hepatocyte nuclei, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-130</NUMEX> non-hepatocyte nuclei, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-300
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70-200</NUMEX> sinusoids in any one image.
          False-positive 'hits' and missed false-negative
          identifications of nuclei were counted. Results for
          hepatocytes nuclei were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 3%</NUMEX> false negative and
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> false positive; for other nuclei, less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> false negative and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15%</NUMEX> false positive. The
          percentage of correctly detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuoles</ENAMEX> including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conglomerates</ENAMEX> of microvesicular change and sinusoids were
          determined by an estimation of correct identification.
          The result for vacuoles and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX> of
          microvesicular change were in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 40%</NUMEX>
          false negative and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> false positive. Smaller
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> could not be correctly identified because of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> limits, but the heterogeneity in the cytoplasm
          could be detected by the texture analysis. Estimate for
          sinusoids was in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> false negative
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> false positive.
          The field-specific features clear space,
          hematoxylin-stained areas and texture have no direct
          quantifiable visual correlation; this also applies to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometric</ENAMEX> and density features that are derived from the
          basic tissue elements and therefore cannot be validated
          by human observation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> data analysis
          The 'raw' microarray data, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> readouts
          per gene, were prepared for analysis by removing outliers
          and undergoing normalization. Generally, outliers result
          in expression values that are much larger than expected.
          To minimize the effects of the outliers, an outlier
          detection filter was applied to the data. First, the
          median of each set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> data points was calculated,
          then the absolute value of the difference between each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> point and the median of the set to which it belonged
          was calculated. The median absolute deviation was then
          determined. A modified z-score for each original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression value was derived as the absolute
          difference between the original data point and the median
          of the set to which it belonged, multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6745</NUMEX> and
          divided by the median absolute difference for the set [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . Then, if the largest gene-expression value in a
          given set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> values had a modified z-score larger
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX>, it was labeled an outlier and removed from the
          raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dataset</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 0.3%</NUMEX> of all raw data points were
          determined to be outliers using this method. After
          outlier removal, the resulting datasets were normalized
          with respect to the median value of all raw data points
          on a given microarray to adjust for array-to-array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. The medians of the remaining gene-expression
          values for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> on the microarray were then
          calculated and used for further analysis. This data
          preparation resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene-expression value per
          gene per animal and is referred to as the 'normalized'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank order correlation is a rank-based
          adjustment to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s correlation, which checks for
          strength of a linear relationship between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank order correlation ranks the data
          in each variable and then calculates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s
          correlation with the paired ranked data, hence checking
          for the strength of a monotone relationship; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values are based on permutation
          methods.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> is a statistical technique to reduce the
          dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of
          the variability as possible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Each principal
          component captures as much variability as possible with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> combination of the data and is uncorrelated with
          all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> components. The resulting data points
          represent a projection of the dataset. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> was conducted
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> datasets and hence there were three
          different input variables. With the gene-expression-only
          dataset, we used the 'normalized' gene expression data,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, for all rats. With the tissue-only dataset,
          we used the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 11</NUMEX> tissue metrics for all rats.
          Finally for the combined dataset for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, we
          combined the tissue metrics, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> metrics, and 'normalized'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX> expression values) to give a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,051</NUMEX> measurements, and conducted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> on the
          resulting dataset.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ï 2</ENAMEX>. Also note that 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are the arithmetic means of all of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> components. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was
          estimated using the usual least-squares assumptions,
          where the dependent variable, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , was an indicator variable for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity.
          The cross-validation probability is estimated by first
          calculating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal components of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'normalized</ENAMEX>' data, except for one <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. Using the two
          principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> -toxicity classification, the
          quadratic regression classifier was fit to estimate the
          coefficients 
          Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> through 
          Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> . Then the same eigenvectors, or
          projection estimated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, were applied to the
          left-out observation to estimate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>; note that this side-steps any potential
          prediction bias. The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are then
          plugged into the estimated quadratic regression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classifier</ENAMEX>. If the resulting prediction, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , was above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, then the sample
          was classified as suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity; if the value was below
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, then it was classified as not suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> toxicity. To estimate the accuracy
          of the classification, this was repeated so that every
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was left out and then predicted.
