        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbon Catabolite Repressor</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> factor in 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yCCR4</NUMEX>)
        regulates the expression of a number of genes involved in
        nonfermentative growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , in cell wall integrity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        , in UV sensitivity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and in methionine biosynthesis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . yCCR4 is an essential component of several
        complexes involved in transcription. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one is the
        CCR4-NOT multi-subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which comprises
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDa</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> MDa
        complex contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yCCR4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX> (also referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCAF1</ENAMEX>)
        and at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yNOT1-5 proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . In this
        complex, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX> independently binds to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4 and yNOT1</TIMEX>, and
        is absolutely required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX> to associate with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
        MDa complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> MDa <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX> binds
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yDBF2</ENAMEX>, a cell-cycle regulated protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCAF4 and yCAF16</TIMEX>, and is essential for the
        interaction of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCAF4 and yCAF16</TIMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ySRB9</TIMEX>, a
        component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polII holoenzyme</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . yCCR4 was
        also reported to be associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Paf1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc73</TIMEX>, and Hpr1
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> distinct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRBP</ENAMEX>-containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holoenzyme</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Accordingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4</ENAMEX> contains, in its
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        which was demonstrated to be necessary for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX> binding to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yPOP2</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 11</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yDBF2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCAF4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCAF16</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        components of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex. Moreover, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> discloses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> activation domains which are
        required for transcriptional activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Hypotheses
        concerning yCCR4 function in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> have been documented
        recently. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dlakic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and Hofmann 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] showed that the yCCR4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C-terminus</ENAMEX> contains a fold related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
        endonuclease core, suggesting that it may function as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclease</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX> was shown to be a component, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX>, of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic mRNA
        deadenylase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and to be required for efficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A)-specific mRNA degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . yCCR4 might
        be a catalytic subunit of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, because of its
        nuclease-like domain. Hence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are
        likely to fulfill fundamental functions in gene regulation,
        and it is therefore of general interest to determine if
        similar complexes exist in mammals. Several components of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have already been identified
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homologs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX> (named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1</TIMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hPOP2/hCALIF</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] , and homologs of NOT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT4</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Moreover, interactions between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        demonstrated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Yet, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the present time</TIMEX> there has
        been no report of a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that would be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">structurally</ENAMEX> and functionally close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>. We [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and
        others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] previously characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for highly
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> laevis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> musculus and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> (named 
        nocturnin, "mCCR4" and "hCCR4" ),
        disclosing circadian expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> displaying significant similarity with the
        C-terminus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX> (close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>). Yet, these proteins
        lack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX> (i.e. aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 505</NUMEX>),
        which contains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> activation domains and the
        leucine-rich repeat region necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. To identify orthologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4</ENAMEX> in higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and unravel the phylogenetical relationships
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between yCCR4</TIMEX> and the previously identified genes, we made
        a systematic search for other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> related to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>.
        Here we report the identification of nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in eukaryotes and show, by phylogenetic and
        genomic analyses, that they are grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, one of which contains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> orthologs : these
        orthologs, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, have conserved the yCCR4
        leucine-rich repeat, and we show, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid assays
        and far-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> experiments, that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binds
        to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yPOP2 homologs</ENAMEX>, i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1 and hPOP2</TIMEX>, in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-dependent manner. Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> alignments show that the
        endonuclease-like catalytic motifs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4 C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        domain are strictly conserved among all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in this
        domain. The results therefore strongly suggest the
        existence of a conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>,
        and of a new family of potential deadenylases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          Sorting out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was performed by
          i) searches in databases using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4 C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aa 505-837</ENAMEX>) conserved in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> previously
          identified yCCR4-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          PCR-amplification of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> or
          reverse-transcribed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> using appropriate primers
          followed by sequencing, when required (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          majority of matching hits obtained through BLAST search
          in eukaryotic databases belongs to 
          Arabidopsis thaliana (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>), 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae (fungi),
          and 
          Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
          melanogaster, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus</ENAMEX> musculus and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">animals/metazoa</ENAMEX>), as
          expected from the abundance of these sequences in
          present-day databases. Sequences obtained from bacteria
          databases were not included in the phylogenetic analysis
          because of their poor lod-score, but were considered in
          subsequent analyses. After compilation of the positive
          hits and, for several of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of the
          corresponding cDNAs and sequencing, the open reading
          frame of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> matching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was determined
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A comparative analysis of the
          full-length sequence of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related proteins
          indicates that they all share, as expected from the
          search strategy, a highly conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (hatched box in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B), but, conversely,
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal regions are highly divergent (except for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, see below). A
          multiple sequence alignment performed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          regions (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) allowed the establishment of
          phylogenetic relationships among all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see
          Material and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). As illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree constructed</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining method
          (similar results were obtained using the parsimony
          method, not shown), indeed shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be
          classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, with significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values, which can therefore be considered as
          distinct protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          The formerly identified "mCCR4", "hCCR4" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are grouped within the same
          family (called hereafter the nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, with the
          "mCCR4" and "hCCR4" proteins re-named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.</ENAMEX>nocturnin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX>nocturnin, and the 
          xenopus nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX>). BLAST searches identified a putative 
          drosophila ortholog from genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AE003635</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of cDNA 
          drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, using primers
          (indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C) designed from the predicted open
          reading frame, allowed us to provide the entire coding
          sequence of this gene (named <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">d.nocturnin</ENAMEX>; assigned
          GenBank accession number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AY043266</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>,
          murine, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          xenopus nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> display
          significant levels of similarity in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          region (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-95%</NUMEX> among themselves and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24-27%</NUMEX> with the yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B), but not in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part.
          No ortholog of the nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be found in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome (although
          completely sequenced), thus strongly suggesting that
          there is no such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Besides proteins
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast predicted proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yml118</ENAMEX> and
          ymr285. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>) with significant similarity with the
          yCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 and 24%</NUMEX>, respectively), also falled
          within the nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Finally, two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX> predicted proteins
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Atlg31500 and Atlg31530</TIMEX>) were found to be close to the
          nocturnin family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (not shown), but lacked the most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region, and were therefore
          excluded.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> family, hereafter named the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3635</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
          contains as yet unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The 
          caenorhabditis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ce3635</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CAB07271</NUMEX> predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The 
          drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">d3635</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that we predicted from
          genomic scaffold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AE003635</TIMEX> (nt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">118477 to 120285</TIMEX>; see
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">h3635</NUMEX>) was
          predicted from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic sequence AC016923</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ESTs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI369813</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AW967801</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AW968624</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AW965496</TIMEX>,
          H06019, and by comparison with the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">murine EST</TIMEX> BE634658
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the putative initiation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">codon</TIMEX> (see
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). It should be noted that although some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse ESTs</ENAMEX> do match in BLAST searches, suggesting the
          existence of a murine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          could not be predicted in its entirety because of the
          lack of corresponding overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> or genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Again, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> display a conserved
          C-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32-41%</NUMEX> similarity among themselves and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25-29%</NUMEX> similarity with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>) but differ
          in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (called
          hereafter the angel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) contains the formerly
          identified angel 
          drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX>, with as
          yet no identified function ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , accession number
          X85743), as well as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. musculus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX>, C.

          A. thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.angel</ENAMEX>) was determined from the assembly
          of several murine overlapping matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AI151868,</ENAMEX>

          The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.angel</ENAMEX>) was predicted from a human

          derives from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the AAC17686</TIMEX> putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, predicted

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">At3g18500</NUMEX> predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Once
          more, the human, murine, 
          drosophila, caenorhabditis and 
          arabidopsis angel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have a
          highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33-88%</NUMEX> similarity
          among themselves and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25-33%</NUMEX> similarity with the yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>), but differ in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> family (hereafter named the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>)
          contains the formerly identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast CCR4 protein</ENAMEX> and
          as yet undefined human, murine, 
          drosophila, caenorhabditis and 
          arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX>) is putatively encoded by the
          KIAA1194 full-length cDNA ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , accession number
          AB033020). The cDNA encoding the murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (named
          mCCR4) was isolated by us using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and primers
          derived from matching <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones, and its open reading
          frame was entirely sequenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assigned GenBank</ENAMEX> accession
          number AY043269; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Aside their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regions
          which display the highest similarity with the yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-41%</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of the human and
          murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> display a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
          region very similar to that of the yeast CCR4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and
          see below). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          caenorhabditis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          characterized from matching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> clones (accession
          number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AE003746 and Z68753</TIMEX>, respectively) in which we
          identified a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LRR domain 20</ENAMEX> kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kb,
          respectively, upstream of the exons for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-like

          primers that mapped upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRRs</ENAMEX> and in the
          C-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (primers indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C)
          demonstrated that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> and 
          drosophila putative proteins
          (hereafter named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ceCCR4 and dCCR4</TIMEX>, with assigned GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AY043268 and AY043267</TIMEX>, respectively;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>) also possess, in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region, a LRR
          motif related to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4 protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Alignment of the leucine-rich repeats (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, murine, 
          drosophila, caenorhabditis and
          yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> disclosed high conservation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> previously shown to define the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-amino
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">acid-long LRRs</TIMEX>, including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4</ENAMEX> and of the
          adenylyl cyclase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PxxaxxaxxLxxLxLsxNxaxxa</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ), thus
          suggesting that the function of this motif has been
          conserved from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to mammals. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX> predicted proteins
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ara3g58580 and ara3g58560</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>) also branch, with
          significative bootstrap values, with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, although their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          regions display significant similarity with the yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>), none of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> possesses a
          LRR domain (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>). Finally, it
          should be noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are
          all significantly smaller than the yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, all of
          them lacking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> activation domains (aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 350</NUMEX>)
          located in the yCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (see
          Discussion).
          Finally, BLAST searches identified a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          yo1042 (accession number <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">014600</ENAMEX>), and an 
          A. thaliana predicted protein
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ara1g02270</TIMEX>; accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At1g02270</NUMEX>) which disclose
          similarity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal part of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> protein
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29% and 25%</NUMEX>, respectively), but which do not cluster in
          an unambiguous manner with any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). It should be noted that all the 
          A. thaliana, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          melanogaster, C. elegans and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> sapiens genes disclosing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">similarities with yCCR4</ENAMEX> have most probably been
          identified, since the genomes of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have
          now been entirely sequenced and since a BLAST search
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal -instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal- sequence
          of yCCR4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aa 1-350</ENAMEX>) did not reveal any significant
          similarity with any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the databases.
        
        
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          Phylogenetic relationships between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> was also analysed through the characterization
          of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the corresponding genes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX>/exon boundaries were determined
          upon alignment of the coding regions of cDNA sequences
          with the corresponding genomic sequences available in
          genomic databases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the family
          could be compared. In all cases, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">locus</ENAMEX> was
          significantly longer than the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drosophila</ENAMEX> and/or 
          caenorhabditis locus, as a result
          of an increase in intron number and/or size. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> do not behave similarly when considering the
          evolution of the number of exons, at least for the animal
          genes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CCR4</TIMEX>, angel and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the 
          drosophila genes contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 1</NUMEX>
          exons, respectively, whereas the human genes contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 3</NUMEX> exons, consistent with a gain of introns in
          evolution. Conversely, a loss of intron can be suspected
          for the nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, for which the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drosophila</ENAMEX> and mammalian genes
          disclose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 3</NUMEX> exons, respectively. In all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
          yeast genes are devoid of intron and 
          arabidopsis genes display the most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX>. Although the number of exons is clearly not
          constant within a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, intron positions are in
          several cases conserved -except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3635</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and
          for 
          arabidopsis genes which do not
          share any intron position with their family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>- (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/4</NUMEX> introns of the 
          drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/7</NUMEX> introns of
          the 
          caenorhabditis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> have positions
          homologous to those of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. In the nocturnin
          and angel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drosophila</ENAMEX> and human genes share
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intron position. Conversely, paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a
          given <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (i.e. genes belonging to different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>) do not have any intron position in common.
          These features suggest (at least for the nocturnin, CCR4
          and angel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which cluster in the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> indeed share a common ancestor, in agreement
          with the phylogenetic data. They also strongly suggest
          that introns were independently acquired, in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. This could be easily accounted for assuming
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were derived by gene duplication,
          from an "ancestral" gene (or genes) devoid of intron at
          the time of duplication.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX>, among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, of
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent endonuclease-like domain, with
          CCR4-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dlakic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and Hofmann 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] recently reported that
          the xe.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4 proteins</ENAMEX> contain a domain with
          similarities with the enzymatic core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonucleases</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we investigated whether such
          sequence similarities also exist for the other
          yCCR4-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with, possibly, conserved features
          specific for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The multiple sequence
          alignment of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) allowed the identification of several blocks of local
          homology, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60%</NUMEX> similarity among
          yCCR4-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> strictly
          conserved among these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see below). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> could be extended to the enzymatic core of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent endonucleases: the

          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HAP1 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . These nucleases share the
          same catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and form a similar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-layered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β-sandwich motif.</ENAMEX> Interestingly, the blocks of homology
          defined for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> all correspond to
          secondary-structure elements (β-strand or α-helix) which
          form the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> endonucleases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition,
          the putative active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> shared by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonucleases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAseI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] , are strictly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in all the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: these are
          residues involved in catalysis (indicated by triangles in

          feature : several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Leu 151, Arg 174 and Glu 300</ENAMEX>,
          indicated with an asterisk in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) can be identified,
          which are strictly invariant among all the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but have no equivalent in the presently aligned

          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are most probably relevant to functions
          common to and specific for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related proteins
          (see Discussion).

          The search for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> identifies
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>, according to the sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyses</ENAMEX> reported above. To confirm these data and gain
          some hints for the existence of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex in
          mammals, we investigated whether the interaction between
          yCCR4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yPOP2</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex is conserved for
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ortholog</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yPOP2</ENAMEX> have

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 33</NUMEX> ] and, more recently, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homolog</ENAMEX> named hPOP2
          or hCALIF [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . Both mCAF1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hPOP2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interact with yCCR4</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> is essential for
          these interactions. To determine whether yCCR4-yPOP2
          interactions are evolutionarily conserved, we examined
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hCCR4</ENAMEX> can bind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1 and hPOP2</TIMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells. The complete hCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> was
          obtained (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA1194</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazusa DNA Research Institute</ENAMEX>),
          and vectors were constructed to express hCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fused</ENAMEX> to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GAL4</ENAMEX> transcription
          factor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGal4-hCCR4</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). A vector expressing hCAF1
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pVP16</NUMEX>-hCAFl) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hPOP2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVP16-hPOP2</ENAMEX>) fused to the VP16
          activation domain was also produced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction assays were performed in Hela
          cells, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pG4-TK-Luc</ENAMEX>) containing
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six GAL4</TIMEX> binding elements upstream of the thymidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (TK) promoter region fused to the luciferase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hela</ENAMEX> cells transfected with
          the fusion constructs and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid, an
          interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAL4 and VP16</TIMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> should
          result in an increase in luciferase expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          As observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, co-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGal4-hCCR4</ENAMEX> with
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVP16-hCAF1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVP16-hPOP2</ENAMEX> elicited a significant
          increase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 35</NUMEX> fold) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pG4</NUMEX>-TK-Luc expression, thus
          demonstrating association between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX> and either hCAF1
          or hPOP2. This increase is dependent on the presence of
          the leucine-rich repeats within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX>, since deletion of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> leucine-rich repeats -within
          pGal4-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hCCR4</NUMEX>(ΔLRR), see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>- completely
          abolished the effect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Finally, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX> fusion
          vector expressing a murine paralog of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i. e.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.</ENAMEX>nocturnin, had no effect when co-expressed with either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVP16-hCAF1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVP16-hPOP2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), thus indicating that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.</ENAMEX>nocturnin does not interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hCAF1</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hPOP2</TIMEX>, as
          expected from the absence of an LRR domain in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. As a control, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pGal4-hCCR4</TIMEX> alone, or in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pVP16</NUMEX>-none plasmid, had no
          effect.
          To verify that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hCCR4</ENAMEX> can bind directly to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1</TIMEX>, we
          performed a far-Western blot analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacterially</ENAMEX> produced, purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-CAF1</ENAMEX> and control GST
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, transferred onto a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and probed with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">methionine</NUMEX>-labeled hCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesized</ENAMEX> in vitro. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
          specific hybridization was observed only with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-CAF1</ENAMEX>,
          and not with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX>. As a control, incubation with a
          35S-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">methionine</NUMEX>-labeled luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> failed to show
          any interaction.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing orthologs of
          yCCR4
          In the course of our search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> displaying significant similarity with the yeast
          yCCR4 factor, the best hits were found for cDNAs encoding
          a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          musculus, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX>, that we further
          characterized by both in silico and in vivo approaches.
          By several criteria, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> appear to be yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX>. First, they cluster together with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yCCR4</NUMEX> in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> tree constructed for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Likewise, analysis of their genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> revealed that the 
          caenorhabditis, drosophila and
          human CCR4 genes had several introns in common, located
          at homologous positions, suggesting that they arose from
          a common ancestor. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, their N-terminus contain a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five leucine</NUMEX>-rich repeat domain, disclosing a high level
          of similarity with that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>, and with strictly
          conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at consensus positions. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the
          ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> to bind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCAF1 and hPOP2</TIMEX> is conserved for
          the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, since we could demonstrate, using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> and far-Western blot analyses, an in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> and in vitro interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4 and hCAF1</TIMEX> or
          hPOP2/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CALIF. Moreover</ENAMEX> we could show, using a deletion
          within the leucine-rich repeat domain, that this motif is
          essential for the interaction, a key feature of the
          previously characterized <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> factor.
          Interestingly, the putative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCCR4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dCCR4</ENAMEX> and
          ceCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are much smaller than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>. In fact,
          they contain the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">LRR</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region of
          yCCR4, but they lack its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 1-350</ENAMEX>). It
          is noteworthy that, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-350</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">350-837</ENAMEX>) have well-defined and
          distinct functions, which can be uncoupled. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transactivation domains,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-repressed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 1-160</ENAMEX>). This
          region can, by itself, activate transcription when
          targeted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> via a heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LRR plus C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          of yCCR4 cannot mediate transcription activation, but is
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The
          yCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> is necessary for the binding of several
          components of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yPOP2</NUMEX> -and
          mCAF1- [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yDBF2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCAF4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCAF16</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ,
          and deletion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> does not impair
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. Consistently, the region encompassing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> and part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 302-668</ENAMEX>) has
          been defined as the smallest region necessary and
          sufficient for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4 with yPOP2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Conservation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>,
          together with the absence of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> in the CCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, could be interpreted along two
          lines. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain might mediate
          yeast-specific functions (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. glucose</ENAMEX>-regulated growth),
          not conserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> because they were unnecessary or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundant</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domains</ENAMEX> observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the yCCR4</TIMEX> multifunctional protein
          might have been split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> -or more- independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. If neither interpretation can as yet
          be favoured, it is noteworthy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX> evolution
          parallels that of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">namely yPOP2.</ENAMEX> Indeed, both human homologs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX>, hCAF1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hPOP2</ENAMEX>, lack the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> which are,
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX>, required for transcriptional activation,
          whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yPOP2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, which is involved in the
          interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCCR4</TIMEX>, is conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and
          hPOP2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT2</TIMEX>, the human homolog of the
          yNOT2 component of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex, harbors a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain divergent from that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yNOT2</NUMEX> -required
          for transcriptional activation and interaction with the
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ADA2</NUMEX> factor-, but has conserved the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          domain which is absolutely required for the
          yCCR4-associated function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yNOT2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Therefore,
          it looks as if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex have
          undergone a "concerted" phylogenetic evolution, with the
          yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding multifunctional proteins</ENAMEX> and the
          animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> only encoding "specialized" proteins
          specific for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex. It is tempting to
          speculate that partition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CCR4</TIMEX> or POP2 functions in
          the course of evolution has been positively selected as
          resulting in a gain of efficacy. Along this line, Draper 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] observed that the two
          transactivation domains present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the yCCR4</TIMEX> N-terminus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 1</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>) are, alone, more potent activators
          than within the full-length yCCR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Likewise,
          mCAF1, which has lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal transactivation
          domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX>, binds to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX> with a higher affinity
          than yPOP2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX> is one of the components of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX>-NOT complex, which also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yPOP2</ENAMEX> and at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yNOT proteins</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, yPOP2
          independently binds to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yCCR4</NUMEX> and to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yNOT1</TIMEX>. A previous
          report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] identified the human orthologs of yPOP2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hPOP2/CALIF</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yNOT1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hNOT1</NUMEX>), and showed that they
          have conserved their ability to bind to each other.
          Hence, the present identification of the human ortholog
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yCCR4</ENAMEX> and the demonstration that it binds to hPOP2 now
          provide an additionnal piece of the puzzle, strongly
          suggesting the existence of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX>-NOT complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
          Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX>, via its LRR domain, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yDBF2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yCAF4 and yCAF16</TIMEX>) of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX>-NOT complex. Conservation of the LRR
          domain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCCR4</TIMEX> suggests that the interaction with these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> might be conserved as well in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hCCR4</ENAMEX> also binds to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yPOP2 paralog</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCAF1</TIMEX>. However, at variance
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hPOP2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hCAF1</ENAMEX> is not able to interact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hNOT1</TIMEX> (nor
          with hNOT3) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . This suggests that human cells may
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CCR4/</ENAMEX>POP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4-NOT-POP2</ENAMEX> complex analogous to the
          CCR4-NOT yeast complex, and a still unknown CCR4-CAF1
          containing complex. Interestingly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> only one
          CCR4-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">POP2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has been described until now, whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CCR4/POP2</ENAMEX> interactions have been found associated with
          both transcription regulation and mRNA deadenylase
          activity. This may suggest a "physical" partition of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4-POP2</ENAMEX>-associated functions in the course of
          evolution.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: function and
          origin?
          Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dlakic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and Hofmann 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] showed that the yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C-terminus</ENAMEX> contains a fold related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          endonuclease core. yCCR4 was also shown to be a component
          of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
          and to be required for efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poly</ENAMEX>(A)-specific mRNA
          degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, this
          yCCR4-dependent activity copurifies with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yPOP2</TIMEX>. Since the
          presently characterized mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ortholog</ENAMEX> has
          conserved the ability to bind yPOP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> and displays
          high sequence similarities with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yCCR4</NUMEX> in the nuclease
          core domain, it suggests that the mammalian yCCR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> might also be associated with a deadenylase
          function. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of
          yCCR4-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have also conserved catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and structural elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          nuclease core. In addition, their nuclease regions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">possess residues</ENAMEX> which are strictly invariant among all
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and
          which are not conserved in any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          endonuclease-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, thus strenghtening the
          notion of a common and specific function for the
          yCCR4-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Hence, according to the present
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the angel, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> or nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          may deserve the same putative function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4</ENAMEX>, i.e.
          deadenylation, or at least share common substrate binding
          and/or catalytic specificities (for instance preference
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and/or poly (A) tail). Along this line,
          CCR4-specific conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> may be important for the
          setting of such a specificity, whereas the presence -or
          not- of a LRR domain may determine different associations
          for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, possibly responsible for differences
          in cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> or in enzymatic activity. Until
          now, the only known deadenylase in vertebrates is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A)-specific exoribonuclease, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARN</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNaseD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exonucleases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The present
          results therefore propose a series of new putative
          mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deadenylases</ENAMEX>, and predict a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          that should be functionally important for all
          yCCR4-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the high level of similarity among the
          C-terminal regions of all paralogous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, along with the divergence of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          domains, is intriguing in terms of phylogenetic
          evolution. The C-terminus strong conservation leads to
          the assumption that all the related genes derive by
          duplication events from a common ancestor, but the
          identity of this ancestral gene and the date of expansion
          can only be hypothesized. Occurrence within the CCR4
          family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing genes both in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
          suggests that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing gene existed before the
          divergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Whether such a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing gene could be the common ancestor for all
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (with deletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> and
          several duplication events for the angel, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> and
          nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>) is not known. However, the fact that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
          arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which cluster
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CCR4</TIMEX> branch (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A) do not possess a LRR domain, is not in favour of the
          existence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX>-containing ancestor: in that case, at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> deletion events (versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> LRR
          acquisition event, see below) would be required to
          generate the angel, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3635</TIMEX> and nocturnin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, and the CCR4 
          arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on the other
          hand. Along this line, BLAST searches in bacteria
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> disclosed, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> incompletely sequenced
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">genome</ENAMEX> ( 
          Paenibacillus azotofixans ), an
          open reading frame (nt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3822 to 4583</TIMEX> in the AJ299453
          genomic clone) which contains almost all and displays
          significant similarity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">yCCR4 C-</ENAMEX>terminal region,
          but does not contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain. It is
          therefore plausible that a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal core domain"
          existed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, which was subsequently duplicated several
          times giving rise to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> identified protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and which has been well conserved because it
          deserved a common enzymatic function, at the opposite of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal divergent regions. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRR</ENAMEX> domain would have
          been acquired in one of the duplicates, prior to the
          divergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and fungi.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present characterization, in higher eukaryotes, of
        proteins related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast yCCR4 factor</ENAMEX> leads to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        main conclusions. Firstly, we identified yCCR4 mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> and demonstrated that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> can
        interact with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yPOP2 homologs</ENAMEX>. This result, along
        with the identification by others of human homologs of NOT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, now provides strong evidence for the existence of
        a human CCR4-NOT complex, with conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, we showed that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> yCCR4-related protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that we have
        characterized contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">canonical catalytic residues</ENAMEX> and
        motifs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent endonuclease core, as well as
        strictly conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yCCR4</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. These proteins
        might constitute a new family of deadenylases in mammals,
        for which critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> can be predicted.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Sequence analyses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> were examined for
          homology with the non-redundant nucleotide, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and
          dbEST databases at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>, using the BLAST <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> program.
          Multiple alignments of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> were carried
          out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The
          aligned sequences were further analysed, either by the
          distances method (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neighbor-Joining</ENAMEX> program) or by the
          parsimony method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protpars</ENAMEX> program, not shown). In the
          former case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were constructed using different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, i.e. correction -or not- for multiple
          substitutions, and exclusion -or not- of the positions
          with gaps. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> obtained under these various
          conditions were closely related, disclosing only limited
          variations in the branching pattern of the identified
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.

          included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pG4</NUMEX>-TK-Luc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid together
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL4</ENAMEX> and/or VP16 fusion vectors, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng
          of pCMV-RL vector (cytomegalovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter fused</ENAMEX> to the
          renilla luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Promega</ENAMEX>]) as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control for transfection efficiency. The amount
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SV40 promoter DNA</ENAMEX> was kept constant upon addition,
          when necessary, of pSG5 vector to the transfection
          mixture. The cells were washed and collected <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX>. Luciferase activity was measured in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> using the Dual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luciferase Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>) following
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. In all experiments,
          luciferase activities were normalized with the renilla
          luciferase activity expressed from the pCMV-RL vector.
          Each set of experiments was performed in quadruplicate
          and was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times.
