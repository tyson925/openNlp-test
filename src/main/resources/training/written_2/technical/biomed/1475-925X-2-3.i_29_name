        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> produced by a muscle under voluntary
        contraction is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mechanisms: the firing
        frequency and the recruitment of the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The motor
        unit (MU) is a functional entity consisting of a motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuron</ENAMEX> and the whole set of muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> it innervates.
        Increasing either the firing frequency or the number of
        recruited MUs contributes to increasing the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>.
        The smoothness of the force output of a muscle is enhanced
        by the firing rate / recruitment interaction within the MU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and the mechanical filtering effect of the
        tissue, compensating for the discrete nature of the
        process, which builds up the actual muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> from
        individual muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber twitches</ENAMEX>. The variation of the
        firing rates of the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> occurs simultaneously for
        all the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> within a muscle, and even in different
        muscles acting on the same joint, according to the
        phenomenon of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">'common</NUMEX> drive' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Accordingly, small
        variations of the output force acquired via a force
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transducer</ENAMEX> can be noticed. Also, the control loops
        involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ia, Ib</ENAMEX> afferents are responsible for the
        occurrence of certain peaks within the output force in the
        isometric exercise, and others are due to the activation
        from higher levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Sustained muscular contractions externally associated
        with not being able to maintain a certain force lead to
        physiological fatigue, tremor or pain, localized in the
        specific muscle (localized muscular fatigue). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatigue</ENAMEX> is
        defined as 'any reduction in the force generating capacity
        (measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVC</ENAMEX>) regardless of the task performed' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The fatigued muscle develops tetanic tension more slowly
        than normal and prolongs the relaxation phase
        simultaneously with inner chemical changes. The failure in
        maintaining the motor task defines the endurance limit, and
        endurance time is the total duration of the task up to the
        endurance limit.
        The myoelectric activity detected with surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electrodes</ENAMEX> (SEMG) may be considered as the summation of the
        electrical signals generated by a number of motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
        active within the same motor territory in the proximity of
        the electrodes. The SEMG signal is a convenient mean to
        study the muscle behavior under fatiguing exercise, as it
        proves time-dependent changes, provided care is taken to
        prevent cross talk from adjacent muscles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatigue</ENAMEX> is associated with a compression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> toward lower frequencies, from the very beginning
        of the voluntary contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . This is due to the
        reduction in the conduction velocity in direct relation
        with the muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber membrane excitability</ENAMEX> and with
        neural adaptations, resulting in an increase of the lower
        frequency content of the signal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatigue</ENAMEX> is also associated
        with higher amplitudes of the SEMG signal toward the end of
        the exercise [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6</NUMEX> ] . It has been shown that, in
        sustained motor tasks, changes at different levels,
        including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">motoneural</NUMEX> discharge behaviour, develop before an
        endurance limit is reached, phenomenon called 'central
        fatigue' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and peripheral fatigue develop
        together, and have to be seen not as a result, but as
        complementary elements of a complex strategy striving to
        insure the optimality of the motor behavior within the
        framework of available resources.
        Under muscular contraction, mechanical vibrations occur,
        due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main processes: (i) the inner muscular
        vibrations, which are the intrinsic components of the
        muscle contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) oscillations of the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> system, e.g. tremor and clonus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artefacts</ENAMEX>. They are located in specific frequency ranges,
        with a certain overlapping: the artefacts - due to large
        movements - show the lowest frequencies, possible tremor
        contributions are below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>, in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> usually
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.85</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and the mechanical inner
        vibrations affect the range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 10 and 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hz</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> may be considered to reflect the mechanical
        muscle vibrations generated by the spatio-temporal
        summation of the individual muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber twitches</ENAMEX> which are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evoked</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MU</ENAMEX> activation by the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>
        recording is useful in experimental situations, when SEMG
        usage is not feasible, such as in complex working
        environments, and in areas with heavy electromagnetic
        pollution. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> was recorded with acceleration or sound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transducers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . The technique of recording
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> was refined using piezoresistive silicon accelerometers
        in a surface mount package [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] to provide a
        reliable acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Preliminary results
        showed the potential of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> signal to monitor the
        muscle fatigue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> recorded
        simultaneously from the same muscle seem to have similar
        behavior [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 15 16</ENAMEX> ] , i.e. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> decrease
        from the very beginning of the contraction, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX>
        values increase.
        The actual study addresses another extensive comparison
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> in monitoring the muscle fatigue,
        aiming to appreciate whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> alone may be used to
        monitor the muscle behavior under fatiguing contraction. We
        are hypothesizing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> can indicate the degree of
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> and therefore can be used to monitor the
        development of the muscle fatigue, in the same way the SEMG
        has been proved to do.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Parameters
          PSD: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> of a stationary random process 
          x 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           is estimated via the discrete-time Fourier
          transform:
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD (ω</ENAMEX>) = | 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFT</ENAMEX> ( 
          x 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           )| 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFT</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourier</ENAMEX> transform of the specific
          sequence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computed</ENAMEX> in this form, this estimation is
          called the periodogram. Because using windows other than
          the rectangular ones does not necessarily improve the
          estimate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , a rectangular window has been used.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> of the SEMG signal is considered the most
          reliable parameter in the time domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . An
          increase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG RMS</ENAMEX> with advancing fatigue has been
          reported in many cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> is claimed to be
          not affected by the cancellation due to the motor unit
          action potential train superposition, which affects other
          processing techniques involving rectification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . It
          is also related to the power of the signal via the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parseval</ENAMEX>'s relation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , thus providing a direct
          connection with the frequency domain:
          
          where 
          PSD 
          
            i 
           -

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th PSD</ENAMEX> component
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> - the number of spectral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>.
          From (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) it follows that the overall average activity
          observed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> of a certain SEMG <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, is
          expressed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> value computed on the same specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> segment of data.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> values were computed for all the
          signals (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>, both muscles) in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The
          evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> with time is shown in contour plots,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX> to display at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> levels the isolines of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> containing the succession of the spectra, from the
          beginning to the end of the contraction.
          MF: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> is the frequency value, separating the power
          spectrum into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> equal surface regions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG MF</ENAMEX> has been
          proved to be a reliable descriptor of the muscle fatigue
          evolution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6 15 16</NUMEX> ] in the isometric exercise.
          For all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, the linear regression was
          performed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> evolutions to compute the

          total.
          The data (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2</ENAMEX>) are graphically illustrated in
          figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>. Statistical comparisons
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>test (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample assuming unequal variances) were
          performed (significance level: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). The null hypothesis
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">H0</NUMEX>) assumed the equality of the compared parameters
          (mean values).
          In all cases (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>, both muscles)
          the average slope (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a1</NUMEX>) of the MF evolution is negative.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG MF</ENAMEX> regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> are closer to each other
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (Biceps <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.55%</NUMEX>; Brachioradialis
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.2%</NUMEX>) than are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG MF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> (Biceps <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.32%</NUMEX>;
          Brachioradialis <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.72%</NUMEX>); this shows a smaller inter-sex

          In all cases (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>- SEMG, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>, both

          between the two muscles, while for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>),
          they are comparable in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biceps</ENAMEX> and
          Brachioradialis, but different in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The local variations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> are due to
        small local variations in the activation of the muscle.
        That is why areas of higher activation strips can be
        noticed in the contour plots (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The mechanical
        resultant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> in the activation (better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> peaks) leads to oscillations of the
        output <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> around its average. Meanwhile there is a
        progressive spreading up of the higher frequency activity
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX>. This may be generated by progressive
        recruitment of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor units</ENAMEX> in the both muscles. A
        larger frequency range toward the end of the task may also
        witness an increased activity of the controlling neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loops</ENAMEX> and modulating subsystems, as fatigue develops.
        The amplitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG RMS</ENAMEX> progressively increases
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) with developing fatigue. This reflects increased
        twitch potentiation. An increase in the activation,
        possibly due to progressively higher number of active motor
        units together with a more synchronous firing may also play
        a role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> increase. The same increase is shown by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>); this demonstrates that not only
        peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG RMS</ENAMEX>
        increase.
        MF decreases in all cases (both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>, both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscles</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>) from the very beginning of the
        muscle contraction. This proves the central intervention in
        modulating the activation with increasing fatigue (central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatigue</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> decrease may be the effect of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrally</ENAMEX> generated progressive alteration of the
        activation of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNs</ENAMEX> as the relaxation time
        increases; this may be explained by the withdrawal of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tonic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fusimotor</ENAMEX> driven spindle-support via the fusimotor
        loop [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . As the muscle afferents provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 30%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excitation</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>, it seems that this mechanism stays as
        an important provision of intervention. The presynaptic
        inhibition, may also contribute to reducing the fusimotor
        support with advancing fatigue and affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ia</ENAMEX> and Ib
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX>. More, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ib</ENAMEX> inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNs</ENAMEX> also decline in sustained muscular contractions, and
        the gain of force feedback loop is reduced. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-spindle</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> have increased discharge rates
        with increasing fatigue, also contributing to the
        inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, the alpha MNs are centrally
        inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX>, activated
        by the accumulation of metabolites in the fatiguing muscle,
        but this is expected to come into action later than from
        the beginning, to further accelerate the process. This may
        be witnessed by the nonlinear spreading up of the frequency
        range and increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX>.
        The above discussion shows the intimate link between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> as functionally related signals; they both
        witness the neural activation of the muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and
        its mechanical effect, respectively. This functional link
        helps explaining the difference between the MF intercept
        points in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> itself results
        as a spatio-temporal fused effect of the muscle fiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twitches</ENAMEX>. Hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> frequency spectrum is located
        lower than the SEMG spectrum on the frequency scale. This
        effect is further enhanced by the filtering effect of the
        tissue between the contraction site and the transducer.
        This mechanical filtering effect may also explain smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-sex variability shown by the MF slope for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX>
        compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG MF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) are statistically different
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biceps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brachioradialis</ENAMEX> muscles in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and total. In the isometric contraction, addressed by
        this work, this muscle shows a decrease of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX>, less accentuated than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Biceps</ENAMEX> muscle shows.
        Even if the both muscles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biceps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brachioradialis</ENAMEX>) are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensively</ENAMEX> worked out, they are differently loaded,
        relative to their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVCs</ENAMEX>. This may influence the
        balance between the centrally modulated activation and the
        peripheral phenomena in each of them and may explain the
        difference. The above explanation may also address the
        significant difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG RMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>)
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biceps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brachioradialis</ENAMEX> muscles.
        A study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] brought results in agreement with our
        results regarding the evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX>. The
        study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] mentions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> give
        information on the localized fatigue. Our results show that
        both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> demonstrate the central component of
        the fatigue (the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> from the very beginning of
        the contraction). That is why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> is as valuable as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX> in exploring not only peripheral fatigue, but also
        sensorimotor interaction and central intervention in the
        development of the muscular fatigue.
      
      
        Conclusion
        This study addresses a quantitative comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX>)
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">accelerometer</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMG</ENAMEX>. It brings additional
        evidence on the central fatigue and provides means of
        quantifying the fatigue development in the isometric
        exercise.
        According to this study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> signal can be used for
        indication of the degree of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> and for
        monitoring the muscle fatigue development in the isometric
        contraction.
        The study also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> the use of the integrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">accelerometer</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> acquisition. An accelerometer-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> transducer is selective, not dependent of the
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acoustical</ENAMEX> and electrical noise and it also
        provides positional information on motor-unit territory.
        The transducer can be incorporated into a miniature,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stand-alone</ENAMEX>, radio-frequency-powered device, which can be
        chronically implanted in the muscle. As such, it has
        multi-faceted potential for future research in movement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroscience</ENAMEX> in adverse environments, when it is not
        feasible to use the SEMG: complex working environments, and
        situations wherein the SEMG signal is contaminated by
        electrical noise.
        The work also encourages further research on the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG</ENAMEX> in dynamic contraction.
