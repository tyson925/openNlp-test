        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipid</ENAMEX> and lipoprotein abnormalities play a major role in
        the development and progression of coronary artery disease.
        Low levels of high density lipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and high
        levels of low density lipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> have been
        identified as independent coronary risk factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Throughout the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thcentury, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have
        focused their interest on prevention and therapy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX> through the evaluation and
        modification of several lifestyle risk factors. Among the
        factors that may influence the occurrence of cardiovascular
        disease the beneficial effect of physical activity on human
        health has been underlined in several studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        protective role of physical activity on cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">morbidity</ENAMEX> has, mainly, attributed to its favourable effects
        on several "traditional" coronary risk factors, like body
        mass composition, and arterial blood pressures as well as
        to inflammation process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . On the other hand, the
        influence of physical activity on lipids levels showed
        conflicting results in the few large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies
        that have evaluated this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Therefore we sought to investigate the effect of
        physical activity status on several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lipids</ENAMEX>, such as
        High <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Density Lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (HDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, Low Density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apolipoproteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apo</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> and
        B, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
        triglycerides, in a population-based sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
        without any clinical evidence of cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methdos
        
          Study's sample
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATTICA</ENAMEX> study is a health and nutrition survey,
          which is being carried out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of Attica
          (during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001-2002</TIMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is a major metropolis. A
          stratified sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1376</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years old</TIMEX>, range:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 - 86</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1396</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years old</TIMEX>, range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> -
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>) was drawn from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, with exclusion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. The stratification was
          based on the age - gender - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX> distribution provided by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Statistical Service</ENAMEX> according to the census
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. There were only minor differences in
          distribution by gender and age between the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The study's design
          anticipates enrolling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> per household.
          The sampling was random. The number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          was determined by power analysis, and chosen to evaluate
          differences between the investigated parameters and
          physical activity levels <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 10%</NUMEX>, achieving
          statistical power > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> probability
          level (P-value). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> entered in this study
          were without any clinical evidence of coronary heart
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or any atherosclerotic disease. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> interviewed by trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> who used a
          standard questionnaire. Any subject with co-morbidities
          that may affect physical activity status was excluded
          from this analysis.
        
        
          Evaluation of physical activity
          We estimated an index of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> energy expenditure as
          follows: all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were asked the average daily
          number of stairs climbed, and the number of city blocks
          walked during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. We next
          examined the type, frequency (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> per year), duration
          (time per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>) and intensity of sports related physical
          activity during the same period. Intensity was gradated
          in qualitative terms such as: light (expended calories
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">< 4 Kcal/ min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking slowly, cycling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stationary</ENAMEX>, light stretching etc.), moderate (expended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calories 4-7 Kcal/ min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking briskly, cycling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outdoor</ENAMEX>, swimming moderate effort etc.) and high
          (expended calories ><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7 Kcal/ min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking briskly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uphill</ENAMEX>, long distance running, cycling fast or racing,
          swimming fast crawl etc.). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> who did not
          report any physical activities were defined as sedentary.
          For the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> we calculated a combined
          score by multiplying the weekly frequency, duration, and
          intensity of physical activity. Then we calculated the
          tertiles of this score and the physically active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: low
          physical activity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 sttertile</NUMEX>), medium physical activity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ndtertile</NUMEX>) and high physical activity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 rdtertile</NUMEX>).
          This assessment of physical activity is reliable, valid
          and has been performed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in the past
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
          The presence of occupational exercise was recorded but
          it was not taken into account for the analysis due to
          difficulties in evaluation and standardization. This
          exclusion may confound our findings, but the large sample
          size and the applied randomised procedure can spread the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who reported occupational exercise equally in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> and clinical parameters
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were collected from the antecubital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vein</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8 to 10 a.m.</TIMEX>, in a sitting position after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of fasting and avoiding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. The biochemical
          evaluation was carried out in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> that
          followed the criteria of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipid Reference Laboratories</ENAMEX>. All biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examinations</ENAMEX> (serum total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>) were
          measured using chromatographic enzymic method in a
          Technicon automatic analyzer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> was
          determined after precipitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apolipoprotein</ENAMEX> B
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> with dextran-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">magnesium</NUMEX>-chloride.
          The intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels did not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9% and</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. Non-HDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was calculated by the formula:
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>.
          Fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dl</ENAMEX>) was measured at serum.
          Resting blood pressure was measured with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> sitting
          comfortably for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-10 minutes</TIMEX> and the cuff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> supported
          at the heart level. An average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive
          measurements was recorded for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Demographic and lifestyle characteristics
          The study's questionnaire also included demographic
          characteristics like age, gender, financial status
          (average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX>), and
          education level (as an index of social status) that was
          measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of school. We also asked for the
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, and this information was
          converted to daily <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> by multiplying each
          glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> or spirits with its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> content
          (adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> ethanol concentration).
          Information about smoking habits was collected using a
          standardized questionnaire developed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study</ENAMEX>.
          Current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were defined as those who smoked at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cigarette per day. Never smokers those who have never
          tried a cigarette in their life and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were
          defined as those who had stopped smoking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> previously. For the multivariate statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyses</ENAMEX> cigarette smoking was quantified in pack-years
          (cigarette packs per day <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of smoking), adjusted
          for a nicotine content of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.8 mg</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/</ENAMEX> cigarette. Height was
          measured, to the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> cm, without shoes, back
          square against the wall tape, eyes looking straight ahead
          (visual axis is horizontal when the top of external
          auditory meat us is level with the inferior margin of
          bony orbit), with a right-angles triangle resting of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scalp</ENAMEX> and against the wall. Weight was measured with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lever</ENAMEX> balance, to the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>, without shoes, in
          light undergarments. Body mass index was measured as
          weight (in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilograms</NUMEX>) divided by standing height (in
          meters squared). Details regarding the aims and the
          design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATTICA</ENAMEX> study have already presented
          elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Continuous variables are presented as mean values ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation, while qualitative variables are
          presented as absolute and relative frequencies.
          Associations between categorical variables were tested by
          the use of contingency tables and the calculation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi</ENAMEX>-squared test. Comparisons between normally
          distributed continuous variables and categorical were
          performed by the calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-test and
          one-way or multi way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX> of co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Variance</ENAMEX> (MANCOVA),
          after controlling for equality of variances
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">homoscedacity</NUMEX>). In order to evaluate differences between
          physical activity groups we applied post hoc analysis
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferonni</ENAMEX> correction. In the case of
          asymmetric continuous variables the tested hypotheses
          were based on the calculations of the non-parametric test
          suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kruskal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallis</ENAMEX>. Correlations between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX> levels and age, smoking habits (in pack-years) and
          body mass index were evaluated by the calculation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s correlation coefficient. Associations between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX> levels and physical activity status were tested
          through multiple linear regression analysis after the
          adjustment for several potential confounders and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. All reported 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided
          tests and compared to a significance level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. SPSS
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1</NUMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS Inc.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used for all the
          statistical calculations.
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eighty-two</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were
        classified into high physical activity levels, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into medium, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into low physical activity
        levels. The rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, i.e. 755 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) of men
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">785</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were classified as sedentary. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>
        were less physically active as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.062</NUMEX>).
        A gender interaction was observed between physical
        activity status and lipid levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
        Particularly, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported sedentary
        life, those who defined as physically active had
        significantly lower levels of total serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, LDL
        and oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, apolipoprotein
        B, and higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein
        A1. However, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> physical activity seems to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the aforementioned lipids, but the benefits
        did not reach statistical significance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Moreover,
        physically active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were younger as compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sedentary</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44 ± 12</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years old</TIMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>),
        and were less frequent to be active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>, p
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). An inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was observed between body
        mass index and physical activity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sedentary: 27 ± 5</ENAMEX>
        vs. low: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26 ± 5</NUMEX> vs. medium: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26 ± 4</NUMEX> vs. high: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25 ± 4 Kg / m</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Also, compared to sedentary physically
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had lower levels of systolic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">122 ± 19</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">79 ±</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 ± 12</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), as well as blood
        glucose concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">94 ± 31</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90 ± 28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> / dl, p =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.113</NUMEX>). No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were found between indexes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> status (education level and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income), alcohol
        drinking and the adoption of a physically active
        lifestyle.
        We further examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between physical
        activity status and lipids levels through multivariate
        analysis. Firstly we observed that all lipids measurements
        were significantly correlated with age (r 
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>, r

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>, r 
        apoA1 = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.08</NUMEX>, r 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoB</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.23</NUMEX>, r 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oxLDL</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>, all p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Thus,
        after taking into account the confounding effect of age,
        body mass index, dietary intake, and smoking, we observed
        that physical activity was positively associated with HDL -
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> levels, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> but not
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Post hoc analysis revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at
        medium and high physical activity levels had significantly
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) higher
        HDL-cholesterol levels, respectively, as compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sedentary</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at medium and high physical
        activity status had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>)
        higher apolipoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> levels, as compared to sedentary.
        Furthermore, when we stratified the analysis according to
        smoking status we found that compared to sedentary medium
        physical activity was associated with lower total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels both in nonsmoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>)
        and nonsmoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.064</NUMEX>), as well as lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglycerides</ENAMEX> levels in nonsmoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>) and
        nonsmoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-9%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.036</NUMEX>). No differences regarding
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> or triglycerides levels were observed
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between</NUMEX> low or high physical activity status and sedentary
        life. No other statistically significant differences
        between physical activity status and lipids levels were
        found when we stratified the analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (normal, overweight and obese), both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2illustrates</ENAMEX> the effect of physical activity
        on the investigated lipids measurements after taking into
        account the aforementioned confounders.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this work, based on a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based sample
        of cardiovascular disease free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, we revealed a
        statistically significant dose-response relationship
        between physical activity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
        apolipoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, after
        adjusting for age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index and smoking habits of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Inverse linear associations
        were also observed between physical activity and
        triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apolipoprotein</ENAMEX> B levels. However, the benefits from
        physical activity on these lipids were, mainly, explained
        by the observed differences in body mass and smoking habits
        among the physical activity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Numerous studies documented the relation of increased
        physical activity with an improved cardiovascular risk
        factor profile in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. In particular these studies have
        shown the overall benefit of physical activity in reducing
        the risk of developing coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, especially
        due to the reduction of arterial blood pressure levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11</NUMEX> ] , inflammation and coagulation markers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main findings of the present work is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose-response</ENAMEX> relationship between physical activity and
        HDL cholesterol levels, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Particularly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at
        medium and high physical activity levels had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6% and 9%</NUMEX>
        higher HDL-cholesterol levels, respectively, as compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sedentary</ENAMEX>. Similar results were observed in apolipoprotein
        A1 levels. It is notable that the previous associations
        were independent from the effect of body mass index,
        smoking habits and age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pawtucket</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Study</ENAMEX> reported that physical activity was
        significantly associated with lower blood pressure as well
        as body mass index and higher HDL-cholesterol levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . Moreover, among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> adult <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> frequency of
        physical activity was independently and positively related
        to HDL-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, a pooled analysis
        among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> consisting of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly men</ENAMEX> demonstrated a significant relation of physical
        activity with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The same findings
        were observed in several studies that included only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Our insignificant findings regarding physical
        activity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> or apolipoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
        could be attribute to the differences on body mass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, and smoking habits between physical activity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The present study cannot provide causal inference
        about the effect of the gender interaction with physical
        activity on HDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX> levels.
        Potential differences on eating habits between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, that they were not evaluated in the present
        analysis, could the answer in the stated hypothesis.
        We also evaluated the effect of physical activity on
        several other lipids levels. Particularly, we observed that
        compared to sedentary physically active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had a reduction
        that varied from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3% to 11%</NUMEX>, in all lipids measurements. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, we also observed a reduction starting from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>, in all lipids, with the most significant reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglycerides</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>). However, we revealed that the benefits
        from physical activity on total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein B levels were mainly
        explained by the reduction in body mass index and the
        decreased smoking habits among physically active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Our findings are in accordance with several other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies that reported a non significant
        effect of physical activity on lipids levels, by the
        exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglycerides [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Regarding the intensity of physical activity that is
        needed for a considerable lowering on lipids levels several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> report that positive changes in HDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels observed in those who were highly
        exercised, i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least 12 - 15 miles</NUMEX> per week [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Although, it is difficult to compare results among studies,
        because different methods were used to classify physical
        activity levels, our study revealed that even medium
        physical activity levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 - 7 kcal/min, > 3</ENAMEX> times per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>) was associated with a significant reduction in HDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> or more times per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, along with relatively moderate intensity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, are within the ability and tolerance of most
        middle aged and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        It is widely accepted that exercise affects blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and other lipids in a positive way, by
        regulating the metabolism of all lipids in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
        Several studies, including the present, demonstrate that
        exercise raises <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Another major
        impact of exercise on lipids is that it lowers triglyceride
        levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However, exercises exert a minor impact on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX> and to a lesser extend, total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>. In fact dietary interventions have much better
        luck in lowering blood cholesterol levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The
        latter could be viewed as disappointing concerning the
        effect of physical activity. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        suggest that the way to avoid a decline in HDL-cholesterol
        that occurs with dieting is to combine diet with exercise.
        It has been shown that those who decrease their fat intake
        through dieting, but maintain an active exercise program,
        note an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 19</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        if we use the above example, one can easily realize the
        benefits of reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> through dieting while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL-cholesterol</ENAMEX> are maintained. As a result, those who
        exercise regularly have a more favourable lipid profile
        than those who do not exercise. This may translated to a
        reduction in the risk for developing atherosclerosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . How much exercise is required to increase HDL-cholesterol
        levels and improve the overall lipid profile? Our study
        revealed that even medium exercise is adequate to increase
        HDL-cholesterol levels, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Our study is a cross section survey. Thus, we cannot
        provide evidences for causality between physical activity
        and lipids levels. The self-reported history of weekly
        physical activity is also a limitation. This work is also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> is assessing the effects of an intensity - duration
        interaction on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. In
        addition, the influence of diet and genetic factors cannot
        be addressed by our data. All these issues need to be
        addressed by future interventional exercise studies.
        Nevertheless, physical activity was associated with reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX> levels, both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but these benefits
        did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for
        the effect of exercise on body mass index of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> and the confounding effect of smoking and
        dietary habits. On the other hand, substantial increases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A1</ENAMEX> concentrations were
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who exercised even at medium levels.
