        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sec</ENAMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> export pathway of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> is responsible for
        translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory proteins</ENAMEX> across the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> to final destinations in the periplasm or outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Secretory proteins</ENAMEX>, also called preproteins, are
        synthesized with a cleavable amino terminal signal sequence
        that functions both to slow folding of the preprotein and
        to aid in recognition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory protein</ENAMEX> by export
        factors. Export of many, but not all, secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
        dependent on interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX>, a cytoplasmic chaperone
        that maintains the preprotein in a loosely folded
        conformation competent for translocation. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> and the
        preprotein provide binding sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecA</ENAMEX>, a peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane ATPase</ENAMEX>. SecA targets the preprotein to the
        membranous translocase complex composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecY, SecE</ENAMEX>,
        SecG, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecD, SecF</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YajC</ENAMEX>. Formation of the complete
        translocase complex promotes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding and hydrolysis
        cycle by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecA</ENAMEX> that results in segmental translocation of
        the secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> across the membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The signal sequence is crucial for efficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX>; mutations in the signal sequence
        significantly reduce export of the preprotein and complete
        deletions of the signal sequence eliminate essentially all
        export [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Selection for extragenic suppressors
        of such export defective preproteins led to the
        identification of the 
        prl alleles of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secY</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlA</ENAMEX> ), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secE</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlG</ENAMEX> ), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secA</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlD</ENAMEX> ), and more recently 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secG</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlH</ENAMEX> ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prl</ENAMEX> suppressors function by
        expanded or altered interactions with signal sequences,
        facilitating recognition of mutant as well as wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        More recent observations support an alternative
        mechanism of action for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA/SecY</ENAMEX> and PrlG/SecE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppressors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] . First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA/G-mediated</ENAMEX> suppression
        does not exhibit allele specificity; all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlA</ENAMEX> and all 
        prlG alleles that have been examined
        suppress all signal sequence mutations, implying that
        suppression is not due to a specific altered interaction
        that allows recognition of a mutant signal sequence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 12</NUMEX>
        ] . Furthermore, all of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlA</ENAMEX> and 
        prlG alleles suppress complete
        deletions of the signal sequence, suggesting that an
        interaction between the signal sequence and the Prl
        suppressor is not necessary for suppression or even for
        export [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8 13</NUMEX> ] . Based on these observations, it was
        proposed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlG</ENAMEX> suppressors do not function
        through altered interactions with signal sequences, but
        rather by loss of recognition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] . The wild type SecE
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SecY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are thought to function in concert to
        proofread the signal sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory proteins</ENAMEX>,
        rejecting defective precursors from the export pathway. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecY</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PrlG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecE</ENAMEX>) suppressors are compromised in
        their ability to proofread, allowing export of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        with mutations, or even complete deletions, of the signal
        sequence.
        This proofreading model predicts that the critical step
        for translocation of a signal sequence-defective secretory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is recognition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> and subsequent presentation
        to SecE/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y. SecB</ENAMEX> binds portions of the mature secretory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecA</ENAMEX> would bind to the
        SecB-precursor complex by virtue of its ability to bind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] as well as the preprotein [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SecA</ENAMEX>-mediated targeting of the preprotein to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocase</ENAMEX> would occur. In a wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, the mutant
        precursor would be rejected at this point by SecY/E, but in
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PrlG</ENAMEX> suppressor strain, rejection would not occur
        and the mutant secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would be exported.
        In fact, all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrlG</ENAMEX> suppressors are
        completely dependent on functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> for manifestation
        of suppressor activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8</NUMEX> ] . Even certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        are not normally SecB-dependent for translocation become
        SecB-dependent when they contain a signal sequence mutation
        and are exported via the suppressor pathway. For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhoA</ENAMEX> is normally exported independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX>. Deletion of
        the signal sequence from 
        phoA severely compromises export;
        export is restored in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prlA</ENAMEX> suppressor strain. However, this
        suppression is dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, there
        are characteristics of the mature portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhoA</ENAMEX> that
        promote recognition by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX>, and this recognition is
        essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PrlA</ENAMEX>-mediated suppression.
        Although 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prlA</ENAMEX> and 
        prlG strains export secretory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that completely lack a signal sequence, there is
        no evidence of export of any cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prl</ENAMEX> suppressor strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . That
        is, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are supposed to remain in the cytoplasm
        are not mislocalized to the periplasm. It has been
        suggested that perhaps cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are not
        exported in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prl</ENAMEX> suppressor strains because they
        fold rapidly and escape recognition by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX>, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory proteins</ENAMEX>, even those lacking a signal sequence,
        fold more slowly, allowing time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> recognition and
        binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 13</ENAMEX> ] . SecB binds to a variety of unfolded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , although binding appears to
        be more selective in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . This selectivity may be
        based on the slower folding characteristics of secretory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, we proposed previously that if a cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contains a mutation that slows its rate of folding,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> will recognize and bind to that mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> would result in targeting of the unfolded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the translocation apparatus. According to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">proofreading</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, in a wild type strain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecE</ENAMEX> and SecY
        would reject the unfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> due to lack of a signal
        sequence. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Prl</ENAMEX> suppressor strain, however, the
        proofreading function would be compromised and the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would be exported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In the experiments
        described here, we tested this hypothesis by examining the
        export of such a cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a folding
        mutation. The results indicate that slow folding is not
        sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> binding and subsequent targeting to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocase</ENAMEX> and further, that secretory proteins contain
        targeting information in addition to the signal sequence
        and the folding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinetics</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">102LTand LA57-N</ENAMEX> 102LT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pKL106</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pKL107</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LT-FLAG</ENAMEX>
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">102LT-FLAG</ENAMEX>, respectively, were transformed into
          strains IM104 (wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secY</ENAMEX> ) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IM105</NUMEX> ( 
          prlA4 ). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> contained
          deletion mutations in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lon</ENAMEX> and 
          degP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to limit proteolysis in
          both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces. Following
          induction of the λ repressor fragment, whole cell
          lysates, spheroplasts, and periplasmic fractions were
          prepared from each strain. Samples were analyzed by
          Western blotting using antibodies directed against the
          FLAG epitope present at the carboxyl terminus of the λ
          repressor fragments.
          According to our hypothesis, the largely unfolded
          nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTshould</ENAMEX> allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> to bind,
          resulting in targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translocase</ENAMEX>. In
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secY</ENAMEX> wild type strain, proofreading
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecE/Y</ENAMEX> would block export of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LT</ENAMEX>, while in
          the 
          prlA4 strain, the PrlA4 suppressor
          would allow export of a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTto</ENAMEX> the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periplasm</ENAMEX>. This was not the result we observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          No <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTwas</ENAMEX> detected in the periplasm, even in the
          
          prlA4 strain, indicating that
          export did not occur to any significant extent. To ensure
          that all periplasmic contents were released during the
          spheroplast preparation, the blots were stripped of FLAG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and reprobed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> directed against
          MalE, a periplasmic binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. All detectable MalE
          was present in the periplasmic fractions (data not
          shown), demonstrating that complete release of the
          periplasmic contents had been attained. Therefore, there
          was no detectable export of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTin</ENAMEX> the 
          prlA4 strain.
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasonable explanations for this
          unexpected finding; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an unfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is not
          sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> binding, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) SecB binding is not
          sufficient to promote export in a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prl</ENAMEX> suppressor strain. To
          distinguish between these possibilities, we examined
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX> was able to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTusing</ENAMEX> two
          different methods to identify interactions. The first
          approach was co-immunoprecipitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LT</ENAMEX>-SecB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was an in vitro protease protection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> complexes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitations were performed using whole
          cell lysates of strains induced for expression of λ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressor</ENAMEX>. Immunoprecipitations were performed as
          described using antibodies directed either against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX>
          or against the His tag on the λ repressor. Following the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> reaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were analyzed by
          Western blotting using the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, that is,
          samples that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-SecB
          were examined with anti-His while those that had been
          precipitated with anti-His were probed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-SecB</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, as a positive control, the interaction of SecB
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory protein LamB</ENAMEX> was examined using
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LamB antibodies</ENAMEX>. While an interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LamB</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX> was clearly seen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c), no interaction was
          observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> and either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">102LTor</ENAMEX> LA57-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          102LT(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2b</ENAMEX>). This was true regardless of whether
          the precipitating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was directed against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> or
          the His tag. The wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">102LTwas</ENAMEX> not expected to
          interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> as it would fold very rapidly and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stably</ENAMEX>; it was more surprising that no interaction was
          detected between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> and the destabilized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LT</ENAMEX>.
          This result implied that the unfolded nature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LA57</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          102LTwas not sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> binding.
        
        
          Protease protection assays
          To substantiate the results observed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX>, an in vitro protease protection
          assay was employed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> has a proteolytic-sensitive
          domain that is cleaved by proteinase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> in a limited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX> reaction. When substrate is bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX>,
          the conformation is altered such that the site is no
          longer protease accessible, rendering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SecB</ENAMEX> protease
          resistant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Thus, this assay can be used to detect
          binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> to a substrate. Poly-L-lysine and small
          peptides are routinely used as substrates for this
          analysis as demonstrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>). To
          determine whether a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was also able to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protect SecB</ENAMEX>, we used purified, urea-denatured proOmpA as
          a substrate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proOmpA</ENAMEX> also was able to bind to and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protect SecB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 and 10</TIMEX>) although a much
          higher concentration of substrate was required to achieve
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> protection. To ensure that the observed protection
          was not due simply to the high protein concentration in
          the reaction, a non-secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was used as a
          negative control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> was added to the same concentration
          or higher as proOmpA with no resultant protection of SecB
          (data not shown). Therefore, this assay reliably serves
          as an additional method to observe SecB-substrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">λ repressor proteins</ENAMEX> were purified on a nickel
          affinity chromatography column by virtue of the His tag
          at the carboxyl terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Each was
          assayed for protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> at concentrations up to
          and exceeding that used for proOmpA. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 102LTnor
          LA57-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N 102LTprotected SecB</ENAMEX> from proteolysis, indicating
          that no binding occurred (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, lanes 5-8</ENAMEX>). Although
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant LA57-N 102LTis</ENAMEX> predicted to be in an unfolded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> in the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, the protease
          protection assay was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. To verify that
          refolding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTat</ENAMEX> this temperature was not
          interfering with interpretation of the results, we
          further tested the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> binding activity by incubating
          LA57-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">102LTin 8 M urea</ENAMEX>, then diluting it into the
          protection reaction, similar to the conditions used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proOmpA</ENAMEX>. Again, no protection was detected (data not
          shown). These results demonstrated that even when fully
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfolded</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTwas</ENAMEX> not a substrate for SecB
          binding.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The hypothesis driving the present studies was premised
        on the observation that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prl</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are able to
        correctly identify secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, even in the absence
        of a signal sequence. It has been widely thought that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> was due to slow folding of secretory proteins
        in the cytoplasm, resulting in binding by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> and
        subsequent targeting to translocase. While slow folding may
        be a necessary criterion for export, the data presented
        here indicate that an unfolded nature is not sufficient for
        SecB binding and targeting. This conclusion is based on
        failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LA57-N 102LTprotein</ENAMEX> to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SecB</ENAMEX> either in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> or in vitro. The in vivo results are founded both on
        the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and on the fact that
        no export of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was detected in a 
        prlA4 strain, while the in vitro
        results are based on the protease protection assays.
        Therefore, we conclude that secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> must contain
        information, in addition to the signal sequence and slow
        folding characteristics, that targets them to the secretory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> or that cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain information
        that prevents export even if the folding parameters are
        altered. Further studies are underway to identify such
        targeting sequences.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Bacterial strains</ENAMEX> and plasmids
          All bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used were derivatives of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> strain MC4100 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          IM104 is MC4100 
          lamB14D <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lon</ENAMEX> ::Tn 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 degP ::</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IM105</ENAMEX> is IM104 
          prlA4 . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pKL106</ENAMEX> and pKL107
          are pET11c (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>) derivatives carrying tandem copies
          of the λ repressor fragment (derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">plasmids</ENAMEX> pAD103
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pAD105</ENAMEX>, generous gifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Davidson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Sauer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pKL106</TIMEX>, the wild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type λ repressor</ENAMEX> is tagged with the myc epitope and the
          LA57 λ repressor has the FLAG epitope. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pKL107</TIMEX>, the
          wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">λ repressor</ENAMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG eiptope</ENAMEX> and the
          LA57 mutant has the myc epitope. In all experiments, only
          antibodies to the FLAG epitope were used, therefore
          pKL106 resulted in detection of the mutant λ repressor
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pKL107</ENAMEX> was used to observe the wild type. Plasmids
          pIM101 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pIM102</ENAMEX> were used in the co-immunoprecipitation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> and for purification of the λ repressor fragments.
          These plasmids are derivatives of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pET11c</TIMEX> that contain a
          single copy of the λ repressor, either wild type (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pIM102</NUMEX>)
          or LA57 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pIM101</NUMEX>). The λ repressor inserts contain a FLAG
          tag at the carboxyl terminus followed by a hexahistidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Bacterial growth, induction and
          fractionations
          Plasmid-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          with ampicillin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg ml -1</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>. Cells were
          induced for expression of the λ repressors at an OD 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> by addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM IPTG
          either for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> (spheroplast procedures) or for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> experiments).
          Spheroplasts were prepared similarly to published
          protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of bacterial cells was
          pelleted for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 min at 16,000 rpm</NUMEX> in an Eppendorf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifuge</ENAMEX>. All subsequent steps were performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell pellet</ENAMEX> was resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml spheroplast
          buffer [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M</ENAMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrisHCl</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>,
          and lysozyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 μg ml -1</ENAMEX>)]. After incubation on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 min</TIMEX>, MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was added to a final concentration
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM and incubation continued for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 5</NUMEX> min.
          The spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at
          16,000 rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The resultant supernatant
          contained the periplasmic contents. The pellet, which
          consisted of the membranes and cytoplasmic contents, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml of spheroplast buffer. A parallel
          sample was prepared without the final centrifugation
          step, resulting in a whole cell lysate. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          precipitated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> and resuspended in gel loading
          buffer preparatory to electrophoresis.
        
        
          Immunoblotting
          Fractions were electrophoresed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> polyacrylamide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gels</ENAMEX> and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting
          was performed as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] using monoclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody M2</ENAMEX> directed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG epitope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>) at a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:600 dilution</TIMEX>, or monoclonal antibody
          against MalE (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500</ENAMEX> dilution. When necessary,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were stripped from the nitrocellulose by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> in stripping buffer [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M</ENAMEX> glycine (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mM MgAc</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>] followed by immunoblot blocking
          solution.
        
        
          Immunoprecipitations
          Bacterial cells were induced for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> for λ
          repressor expression as described above and harvested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lysis</ENAMEX>. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with
          minor alterations to previous protocols [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          Specifically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> buffer contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX> and
          incubation with the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was performed
          overnight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibodies</ENAMEX> used were directed against
          the His epitope (monoclonal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>), SecB
          (polyclonal, gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wickner</ENAMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LamB</ENAMEX>
          (polyclonal, gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Silhavy</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune</ENAMEX> complexes
          were collected with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> A agarose (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>), samples
          were electrophoresed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> polyacrylamide gels, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immunoblotting</ENAMEX> performed as described above. Following
          immunodetection, all blots were stripped of primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and reprobed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precipitating antibody</ENAMEX> to
          verify that precipitation had occurred.
        
        
          Protease protection assays
          SecB protease protection assays were performed as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , followed by electrophoresis on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>
          polyacrylamide gels and detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coomassie Blue</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">λ repressor fragments</ENAMEX> were purified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel NTA affinity chromatography</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>).
