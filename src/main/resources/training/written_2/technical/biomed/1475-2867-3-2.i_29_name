        Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated through a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-dependent</ENAMEX> mechanism of initiation. In this process,
        eIF4E, which functions by binding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-methylguanosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap</ENAMEX>, is the rate-limiting factor due to its low abundance [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In normal cells, elevated eIF4E activity is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with proliferation and is regulated by multiple
        mechanisms. eIF4E gene transcription is enhanced in
        response to mitogenic stimulation and may be mediated by
        c-myc [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Phosphorylation of eIF4E by the protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mnk1</ENAMEX> increases its affinity for the cap, and thus
        increases cap-dependent initiation of translation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ]
        . An inhibitor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4E binding protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4EBP</NUMEX>), is also
        regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of 4EBP
        disrupts its ability to bind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX>, freeing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> to bind
        eIF4G, which functions to recruit additional components of
        the initiation complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The net result is that
        phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4EBP</TIMEX> enhances cap-dependent translation
        initiation. 4EBP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is thought to be mediated
        by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mitogen
        stimulated cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        Numerous studies have implicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> in formation and
        progression of tumors. Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF4E</ENAMEX> leads to
        deregulated growth and malignant transformation of a
        variety of cultured cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Moreover,
        elevated levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF4E</ENAMEX> are commonly found in solid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, especially in breast, colon, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck
        tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Clinical studies indicate that eIF4E gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpression</ENAMEX> is associated with
        malignant progression in these tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . High eIF4E
        levels are also associated with a higher rate of cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recurrence</ENAMEX> and cancer-related death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In contrast to
        eIF4E, overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP</ENAMEX> inhibits cell proliferation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> expression levels are inversely correlated
        with the progression of certain types of tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The findings summarized above indicate that elevated
        eIF4E activity plays a fundamental role in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> formation
        and progression and suggest the possibility that eIF4E
        could be exploited as a therapeutic target. This is
        supported by several recent investigations. Inhibiting the
        expression of eIF4E by expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> reverses
        ras-mediated transformation of cultured cells as indicated
        by decreased efficiency of growth in soft agar and tumor
        formation in nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Similarly,
        antisense-mediated reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF4E</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        cells inhibits both their tumorigenic and angiogenic
        properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, overexpression of
        4EBP reverses transformation mediated by v-src [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapamycin</ENAMEX> and its analogs are potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of mTOR
        and lead to cell cycle arrest. Thus there is interest in
        using this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> for chemotherapeutic
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and several phase I trials have been
        carried out [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Treatment of mammalian cells with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rapamycin</ENAMEX> leads to dephosphorylation and activation of
        4EBP, which in turn binds to and inhibits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX>. However,
        several other targets downstream of mTOR are also affected
        by rapamycin. These include effects on other translational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p70S6K</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4G</TIMEX>,
        eIF4B, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eEF2</TIMEX> (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ). At present neither
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> that are essential for inhibition of cell
        proliferation by rapamycin nor the mechanism by which these
        targets mediate cell cycle arrest are completely
        understood.
        In the present study an MCF7 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell line was
        developed which can be induced to express a mutant form of
        4EBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that are targets for
        phosphorylation have been changed to alanines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation
        it constitutively binds to and inhibits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX>. Thus
        expression of the mutant mimics the effects of rapamycin on
        4EBP but does not affect the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of mTOR.
        Induction of the constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> leads to cell
        cycle arrest which correlates with loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin</ENAMEX> D1
        expression and increased levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cyclin</ENAMEX> dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1.</ENAMEX> The increase in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> Kip1is
        mediated, at least in part, by enhanced synthesis of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and corresponds to activation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> Kip1mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region (UTR) and its ability to mediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-independent</ENAMEX> initiation of translation.
      
      
        Results
        
          Expression of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> inhibits
          the proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells
          To test the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> on the proliferation of
          human breast cancer cells, an expression vector encoding
          the constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1 mutant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>) was
          stably transfected into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> cDNA
          was placed under the control of a promoter that is
          responsive to the insect hormone ponasterone A (pon A),
          an ecdysone analog. In the absence of pon A an ecdysone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receptor/VP16</ENAMEX> fusion protein actively represses the
          promoter leading to very low basal levels of expression.
          In the presence of pon A the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecdysone</ENAMEX> receptor recruits
          coactivators that lead to elevated expression. The stably
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7</ENAMEX> line (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>) was treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX> and at various times cells were harvested for
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> expression by Western blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A). Several forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> are present in the stably
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7</ENAMEX> cells. The slower migrating bands
          represent endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> that is phosphorylated at
          various sites. The fastest migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> corresponds to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX>. Treatment with pon A leads to
          a rapid increase in the intensity of the fastest
          migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-</ENAMEX>5A
          mutated form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> which cannot be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX>, the fastest
          migrating form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> is the predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points. Expression of this form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> continues
          to increase for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least five days</TIMEX> after treatment with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pon A.</ENAMEX> In the control cells, which were not treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX>, phosphorylated, inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> is the predominant
          form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Treatment of untransfected
          MCF7 cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX> had no effect on expression or
          phosphorylation status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">expressed 4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is active as determined by a
          large increase in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> bound to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eIF4E</NUMEX> in
          pon A treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          Expression of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX>, through
          inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> activity, would be expected to slow
          the rate of proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells. To test this,
          the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> breast cancer cells was
          determined by counting cell number in cultures treated
          with or without pon A (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX>,
          the cells continued to proliferate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least five</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. However, induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> by the addition of
          pon A almost completely blocked cell proliferation. There
          was no indication of cell death in the pon A treated
          cultures and pon A had no effect on the untransfected
          parental MCF7 cell line (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). These results indicate
          that expression of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> leads to
          cell cycle arrest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells.
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> results in enhanced p27
          Kip1expression and downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin</ENAMEX> D1
          Elevated levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF4E</ENAMEX> are associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumorigenic</ENAMEX> transformation and enhanced expression of
          specific cell cycle regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as cyclin
          D1. Expression of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> should
          lead to a global decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cap</ENAMEX>-dependent translation
          which could lead to cell cycle arrest. However, it is
          also possible that constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> inhibits
          proliferation through specific effects on cell cycle
          regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a number of G1 cell cycle
          regulatory molecules were examined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-</ENAMEX>5A
          cells that had been treated with or without pon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
          Addition of pon A altered the levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical G1
          regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. There was a significant increase in
          the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1observed</ENAMEX> at every time point up to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> after addition of pon A (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>). At
          the same time there was a substantial decrease in the
          level of cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>. No difference was observed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK4</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> between pon A treated and
          untreated cells. Treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-pERV3</ENAMEX> cells, which
          express the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecdysone</ENAMEX> receptor/VP16 fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but not
          the inducible constitutively active 4EBP-1 (see Methods),
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pon A</ENAMEX> had no effect on the expression of any of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B).
        
        
          Constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> does not alter p27
          Kip1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX> turnover rates
          The results above suggest that cell cycle arrest of
          MCF7 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> expression involves
          specific effects on expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1</ENAMEX>.
          The most plausible explanation is that the observed
          changes are mediated by altered rates of translation.
          However, others have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4E</ENAMEX> overexpression
          enhances cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> mRNA transport from the nucleus to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> affects
          this process. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1expression</ENAMEX> is actually
          enhanced while 4EBP-1 would be expected to inhibit
          translation rates. Therefore it was of interest to
          examine the mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1and</ENAMEX> cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX> levels.
          First, to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> led to a change in
          degradation of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1or</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX>, turnover
          rates were estimated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> cells that had
          been treated with or without pon A for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>.
          Cycloheximide was added for various times and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1and
          cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX> levels were estimated by western blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Neither the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1turnover</ENAMEX> nor that of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> was significantly altered by pon A-induced
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>. Thus, modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1and
          cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX> levels in response to expression of
          constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> does not appear to be
          mediated by changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> degradation.
        
        
          Expression of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> does not
          alter p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1mRNA</TIMEX> levels but decreases cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> mRNA
          levels
          To examine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> could regulate p27 Kip1or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> at the transcriptional level or through changes
          in message stability, the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1and</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cyclin</ENAMEX> D1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels were examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4B</ENAMEX>) There was no difference in mRNA levels encoding
          p27 Kip1after treatment with pon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> However, pon A
          treatment led to an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> decrease in the
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1 mRNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). This may contribute
          to the downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1 protein</ENAMEX> and is
          consistent with a previous report showing an increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in cells overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4E</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> enhances de novop27
          Kip1protein synthesis
          The observation that expression of constitutively
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> leads to increased p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1</TIMEX>, but does not
          significantly affect protein turnover or mRNA levels
          suggests that synthesis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 Kip1is</TIMEX> affected.
          Therefore, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1was
          tested by metabolic labeling with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35S</TIMEX>]-labeled amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. After treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7-4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> cells with or
          without pon A for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> the cells were pulse labeled
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 hours</TIMEX>. Half of the cellular extract was used to
          immunoprecipitate cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5B</ENAMEX>). The results
          demonstrate an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 Kip1protein</TIMEX> synthesis of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold in cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>.
          Since no changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 Kip1mRNA</TIMEX> levels or protein
          turnover were observed, the increased synthesis of p27
          Kipmost likely reflects increased rates of translation.
          In the same experiment a substantial decrease in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> was
          observed, which could be due, in part, to lower cyclin D1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly, total protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, as determined by trichloroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (TCA)
          precipitation of total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> following pulse
          labeling, was decreased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 15%</NUMEX> by expression of
          constitutively active 4EBP-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). This is
          consistent with reports that changes in the levels of
          active eIF4E have a much greater effect on the
          translation of specific classes of mRNA than on general
          translation rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 27</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> leads to inhibition of CDK2
          activity
          A critical factor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1</NUMEX>-mediated cell cycle
          arrest is inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> expression did
          not significantly change CDK2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A). However, there was a substantial loss of CDK2
          activity as determined by an immunoprecipitation kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> activity correlated
          with an increase in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). At the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1with CDK4</ENAMEX> was
          dramatically decreased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These results suggest
          that 4EBP-dependent cell cycle arrest involves p27
          Kip1-mediated inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> kinase activity.
        
        
          Expression of constitutively active 4EBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-5A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhances cap-independent</ENAMEX> translation through the p27
          Kip15'-UTR
          A novel finding of the experiments above is that
          synthesis of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1is</ENAMEX> enhanced under
          conditions that are expected to reduce cap-dependent
          translation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1mRNA</ENAMEX> is
          translated through a cap-independent mechanism that does
          not require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eIF4E</NUMEX>. It was recently demonstrated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> within a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> nucleotide sequence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR
          of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 Kip1mRNA</ENAMEX> is able to mediate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-independent</ENAMEX> translation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene in NIH3T3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D6P2T cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . There is a high level of
          sequence homology between the mouse and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human 5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> and
          the major transcriptional start site is also conserved [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . Therefore it is likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5</TIMEX>'-UTR of the human p27
          Kip1message is also able to mediate cap-independent
          translation initiation. To test this, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX> nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX>, representing the full-length human p27
          Kip15'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UTR</ENAMEX> derived from transcription initiation at the
          major start site, was inserted into the bicistronic
          expression vector pGL2CAT<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Luc</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In this vector,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cistron, encoding chloramphenicol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetyltransferase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX>), is proximal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>'s cap
          structure and therefore expected to be translated by the
          conventional cap-dependent translation mode. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          cistron, encoding luciferase, is downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX>
          stop codon and therefore must be translated by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-independent</ENAMEX> mechanism mediated by sequence elements
          inserted between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cistrons. Bicistronic constructs
          without an insert or with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 Kip15</ENAMEX>'-UTR
          inserted in either the correct or reverse orientation
          were transiently expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells. The cells were
          harvested after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> and luciferase
          activities were analyzed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7B</ENAMEX>). Expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> was nearly identical with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> constructs and
          was therefore independent of an insert between the two
          coding regions. In contrast, only the construct carrying
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27 Kip15</NUMEX>'-UTR insert in the correct orientation
          expressed a significant level of luciferase. The ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">luciferase/CAT</ENAMEX> was enhanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12-fold</NUMEX> by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human 5</ENAMEX>'-UTR (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B). Thus the full-length human p27
          Kip15'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is able to mediate cap-independent translation
          in a manner similar to that previously shown for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX>
          nucleotide sequence of the mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          The effect of constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> on the
          activity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27 Kip15</NUMEX>'-UTR was determined by
          cotransfecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bicistronic</ENAMEX> construct together with an
          expression vector encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells.
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> led to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold increase in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">luciferase/CAT</ENAMEX> ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). Interestingly, this is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same level of increase that is observed
          in synthesis of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1protein (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5B).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In normal mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells eIF4E</ENAMEX> activity is
        enhanced due to elevated transcription of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eIF4E</NUMEX> gene, a
        phosphorylation-dependent increase in affinity for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-methylguanosine cap, and phosphorylation-dependent
        inactivation of the inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 4EBP</ENAMEX>. In many tumor
        cells <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> levels are elevated and overexpression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in normal cultured cells causes transformation.
        Elevated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> levels enhance translation of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. Many of these mRNAs are involved in cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. They have long GC-rich <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-UTRs that can form
        extensive secondary structure and have been classified as
        "weak" mRNAs because they are translated inefficiently when
        eIF4E levels are limiting (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ). It has
        been proposed that when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> levels are elevated these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX> can more effectively recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4E</ENAMEX> and its associated
        factors including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4G</ENAMEX>, a scaffold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> essential in
        recruiting the small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4A</ENAMEX>, a
        helicase essential for scanning through secondary
        structures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 27</NUMEX> ] .
        In the experiments described here we have inducibly
        expressed a constitutively active form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> in the
        human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX>. This leads to nearly
        complete inhibition of cell proliferation which is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increase in binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX>.
        This does not lead to a major drop in total protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> as indicated by metabolic labeling with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. However, there are major changes in expression of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cycle regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1</ENAMEX>.
        Cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX> levels decline to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> of that observed in
        uninduced cells and this appears to be due to a reduction
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX> mRNA levels and protein synthesis, since there
        was no evidence for changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX> turnover. The
        observed decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX> is expected since
        constitutively active 4EBP should reverse cyclin D1
        expression mediated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> overexpression. Interestingly,
        others have demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4E</ENAMEX> has an additional role
        in the nucleus. A portion of the cellular eIF4E is imported
        into the nucleus through a mechanism that requires the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 4E-T</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In the nucleus eIF4E is localized to
        specific nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with promyelocytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemia protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ). Nuclear eIF4E appears to
        be involved in export of cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> to the cytosol [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] . Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4E-T</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> interact with the same domain of
        eIF4E that binds <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Thus expression of
        constitutively active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4EBP</TIMEX> may block nuclear functions of
        eIF4E, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> consequence being a reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX> mRNA
        that can be translated in the cytoplasm.
        In contrast to cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 Kip1levels</TIMEX> increase when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> is expressed. An interesting note is that the p27
        Kip1mRNA has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long 5</TIMEX>'-UTR that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and is predicted
        to form stable secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Thus, even
        though it shares these characteristics with the putative
        "weak" mRNAs that require elevated eIF4E activity for
        efficient translation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1responds</ENAMEX> in an opposite
        manner. Part of this can be explained by the fact that the
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is able to promote cap-independent
        translation. When placed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> and luciferase
        coding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in a bicistronic mRNA, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR stimulates
        high level expression of the downstream coding region
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">luciferase</NUMEX>). This property is shared by the highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">homologous mouse</ENAMEX> p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Coexpression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bicistronic</ENAMEX> construct containing the p27
        Kip15'-UTR leads to an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two</NUMEX>-fold increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-independent</ENAMEX> expression. This increase is similar to
        that observed for endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1in</ENAMEX> cells induced to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">express 4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>. The mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> could
        mediate enhanced translation through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p27 Kip15</TIMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is
        not presently known. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that binding of
        4EBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to eIF4E releases other initiation factors that are
        in limited supply but also required for cap-independent
        initiation.
        Inhibition of cell proliferation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> correlates
        with a large decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> activity. This is not due to
        a decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> or cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels. Rather it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to enhanced binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1to</ENAMEX> the cyclin
        E/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CDK2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. This is probably mediated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate
        mechanisms. First, downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> leads to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">release of p27</ENAMEX> Kip1sequestered by the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D1/</ENAMEX>CDK4
        complex. This is indicated by a large decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1with CDK4</ENAMEX> upon induction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> synthesis contributes to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of cellular p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1that</ENAMEX> is available to bind the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E/CDK2</ENAMEX> complex.
        Given its role in control of cell proliferation and in
        tumorigenesis, there is interest in targeting the pathways
        that control eIF4E activity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> chemotherapy.
        Clinical trials using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rapamycin analog CCI-779</ENAMEX> show
        promise for this strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapamycin</ENAMEX> and its
        synthetic analogs block mTOR kinase activity leading to
        dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4EBP</ENAMEX> and other mTOR substrates. MCF7
        cells are sensitive to rapamycin analogs in the low nM
        range [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . A potential problem with the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapamycin</ENAMEX> and its analogs is that some tumors are
        intrinsically resistant to its effects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        Resistance in mammalian cells has been associated with
        decreased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , mutations in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATM protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and low level expression of p27
        Kip1due to enhanced turnover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, it has been demonstrated that fibroblasts from
        p27 Kip1knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are more resistant to the effects of
        rapamycin than normal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Thus p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1is</TIMEX> an
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of cell growth inhibition in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapamycin</ENAMEX>. Many tumor cells express very low levels of p27
        Kip1and this is correlated with poor prognosis. If
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapamycin</ENAMEX> and its analogs are to be developed as useful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antitumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, it will be important to determine how p27
        Kip1levels affect responsiveness to these compounds.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapamycin</ENAMEX> and its analogs affect all of the downstream
        targets of mTOR, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> and other
        components of the translation machinery. The data presented
        here indicate that direct inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4E</TIMEX> may be more
        effective and a more specific means of targeting tumor
        cells than treatment with rapamycin. It will be important
        to determine if direct inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF4E</ENAMEX> is able to
        arrest the cell cycle in rapamycin resistant tumors. If so,
        it may be possible to develop reagents that target eIF4E
        activity, thereby bypassing the upstream signaling events
        in the pathway.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture
          MCF7 cells were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium (DMEM) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal calf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> (FCS), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX> penicillin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX>. The inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7</ENAMEX> cell line expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4EBP-1-5A</ENAMEX> was established using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Complete Controlâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Inducible Mammalian Expression System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>).
          First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells were transfected with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pERV3</NUMEX> vector
          encoding both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ecdysone/glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor fusion protein using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePorter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gene Therapy Systems</ENAMEX>). Stably transfected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were selected using G418 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were further screened for the ability to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inducibly</ENAMEX> express luciferase from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pEGSH-luc</ENAMEX> construct
          in response to pon A in transient transfection assays. A
          responsive cell line derived in this manner (designated
