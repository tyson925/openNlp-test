        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> (CHD) have
        long been considered major contributors to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> noted
        exception is the low mortality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>,
        particularly the southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. This
        phenomenon, commonly referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> paradox, may
        be associated with high consumption of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. A
        negative correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> and alcohol consumption
        was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years ago</TIMEX>, and numerous studies since
        have confirmed a statistically significant inverse
        relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. 
        In vivo studies have shown that wine
        consumption, particularly red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, is more effective in
        the prevention of CHD not seen with other forms of
        alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Accordingly, it has been
        postulated that naturally occurring components in wine
        might afford or contribute to its enhanced protection
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> by targeting sites that participate in the
        etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>, including soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> components (LDL),
        cellular blood elements (platelets), or the vasculature
        itself (endothelium). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creasy</ENAMEX> proposed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans-resveratrol</ENAMEX>, a tri-hydroxy stilbene, in red wine
        exhibits cardioprotective properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and can inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oxidation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], suppress smooth muscle proliferation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>], induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> synthase expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> collagen-induced aggregation responses in washed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelets</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>]. However, relatively few studies
        have been performed on the effects of resveratrol on
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> such as the endothelial cells, which
        are known to play a critical role in maintaining the
        integrity and functioning of the vascular endothelium.
        Homeostasis of the vascular endothelium, both with respect
        to metabolic and physiologic activities, can be affected by
        overall nutritional status and by specific ingredients in
        the diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>].
        The aims of the present study were to determine changes
        resulting from resveratrol:endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell interaction</ENAMEX>. We
        observed that resveratrol induced significant cellular and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> changes in endothelial cells, which were
        accompanied by altered functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to
        conditions simulating arterial flow. Since previous studies
        have shown several signaling molecule changes during
        reorganization of the endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cytoskeleton
        accompanying arterial shear stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30, 31</TIMEX>], we
        evaluated the same set of biochemical parameters in
        resveratrol-treated cells. Use of selective signaling
        pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> allowed the demonstration that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> changes elicited by resveratrol depended on
        intracellular calcium and tyrosine kinase activity changes,
        and also appeared to be linked to integrity of actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaments</ENAMEX> and microtubule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Resveratrol
        treatment also led to activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK1/2 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase,
        similar to changes induced by shear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Thus
        resveratrol may act by a mechanism(s) closely resembling
        that triggered by shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Resveratrol induces morphologic change in
          endothelial cells
          Sterilized plastic <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 mm Ã— 21</NUMEX> mm coverslips were
          seeded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> and treated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h later</TIMEX> with various
          concentrations of resveratrol. Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 2</TIMEX>
          day of culture, the coverslips containing the attached
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAECs</ENAMEX> were fixed, stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, and
          mounted onto slides for analysis by confocal microscopy.
          The polyphenol (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) had a distinct morphologic
          effect, changing the cells from a boxy, cobblestone-like
          appearance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to an elongated, ellipsoidal
          shape with long, tortuous processes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). As little
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Î¼M resveratrol sufficed to induce these cellular
          changes, in passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells (compare panel C with panel
          A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To quantify the percentages of cells with the
          elongated morphology, a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> cells in
          representative microscopic field were counted and the
          results presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The percentage of cells
          showing the elongated phenotype is proportional to the
          concentration of resveratrol added to the culture.
          Treatment with resveratrol also suppressed growth of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> (data not shown), as we previously reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Resveratrol</ENAMEX> treatment leads to increased adherence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> under simulated arterial flow conditions
          To test whether functional changes may accompany the
          modified morphology, control and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 day</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          resveratrol-treated cells were exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 min</ENAMEX>
          (control), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> of simulated arterial shear
          stress using a parallel plate perfusion chamber (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). Following the shear challenge,
          cells remaining attached were scored by staining with
          rhodamine-phalloidin, as described. Since the cells were
          evenly distributed throughout the area of the coverslip
          exposed to flow, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> pictures were taken of
          the confocal microscopy fields located directly in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the coverslip, and the number of cells were
          counted. As can be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 min</ENAMEX>
          sample, a significant percentage of resveratrol-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> remained attached to the plastic coverslips after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min flow challenge. In comparison, under
          identical experimental conditions, cells adhering to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coverslips</ENAMEX> decreased dramatically in controls, with
          virtually no cells remaining after a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min simulated</ENAMEX>
          flow. These results suggest that a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alteration</ENAMEX>,
          measured by greater adherence of cells under simulated
          arterial flow conditions, accompanied the change in
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>, following treatment with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resveratrol</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of cell signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> on cell
          elongation induced by resveratrol
          Further insights into the nature of the
          resveratrol-induced morphologcial changes came from
          studies using selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> for different
          signaling pathways. These include: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quin2</NUMEX>-AM
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular</ENAMEX> [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+]), herbimycin A (tyrosine kinases),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chelerythrine</ENAMEX> (PKC), cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaments</ENAMEX>), and nocodazole (disassembly of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubules</ENAMEX>). Cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>, and
          then exposed to resveratrol. Representative confocal
          microscopy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> for both control and
          resveratrol-treated cells were counted for elongated and
          non-elongated cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> used noticeably
          suppressed cell growth (particularly treatment with
          cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and nocodazole), particularly controls not
          treated with resveratrol. The degree of growth inhibition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">varied</ENAMEX>, depending on preparations of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with resveratrol, which had
          to be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> h because of adverse responses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>),
          afforded better growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1summarized</TIMEX> results averaged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          separate experiments, each performed with a different
          preparation of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX>. Since growth of control
          cells as well as their response to resveratrol and
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors differed</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX>
          preparations, cells showing the elongated shape in each
          experiment were calculated as a percent of total cells
          counted (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-700</NUMEX>). The numbers obtained in
          this manner were used to calculate the mean (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>)Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, as
          shown. Addition of chelerythrine, an inhibitor of protein
          kinase C, caused a significant increase in percentage of
          elongated cells alone and did not affect morphologic
          response of cells to resveratrol. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] and tyrosine kinase activity
          effectively reduced the percentage of elongated cells
          elicited by resveratrol. Results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1further</ENAMEX> showed
          that cytoskeletal changes elicited by resveratrol also
          appeared to be linked to integrity of actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaments</ENAMEX> and microtubule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> as the morphologic
          changes were also substantially lowered in cells treated
          with cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and nocodazole, which inhibit
          formation of actin microfilaments and microtubule
          network, respectively.
        
        
          Effect of resveratrol on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> activation and
          eIF4E, eNOS expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> changes in resveratrol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> were
          assessed by western blot analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5shows that in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cells, level of active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>-P remained
          relatively constant <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to 48</NUMEX> h but showed a precipitous
          decline from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 to 96</TIMEX> h (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A). Under the same
          conditions, levels of total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B), eIF4E
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C), a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effector</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ERK1/ERK2</ENAMEX>, and actin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E) showed no substantial change at all time points
          assayed, in control cells. Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼M</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          Î¼M resveratrol prevented the decrease in active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>-P
          seen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A, last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>). In addition, these
          concentrations of resveratrol markedly increased eNOS
          expression <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 6-h</TIMEX>, which reached maximum
          induction at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48-h</TIMEX>, and remained substantially elevated at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96-h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D). Quantification of relative changes of
          total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>, active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>-P, and eNOS as a function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> concentrations of resveratrol
          is depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Modulation of endothelial cell shape by
          resveratrol
          Size, shape, mutual orientation, and intercellular
          contacts in endothelium are not incidental and statistic
          events, but are precisely and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dynamically</ENAMEX> regulated.
          Reversible change of endothelial cell shape, mutual
          orientation of cells in certain directions, changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercellular</ENAMEX> contacts, are controlled by a number of
          factors, such as, cooperative stimulation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>],
          dietary ingredients, e.g., retinoids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], exercise [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>], and fluid-imposed shear stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38, 39</TIMEX>].
          For example, endothelial cells are known to elongate and
          reorient their cytoskeletons in the direction of flow as
          a normal physiological response to prolonged shear stress
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Results of the present studies show that treatment
          with resveratrol induces a morphologic change from a
          stellar to an elongated shape (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It is tempting
          to speculate that appearance of such cellular phenotype
          involves formation of stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, which would
          rearrange the cytoskeleton in ways that facilitate better
          anchoring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> to the culture substratum and
          contribute to the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> to resist simulated
          arterial flow challenge. Only studies in the future would
          validate such a possibility. It is also interesting to
          note that the observed changes in resveratrol-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> are similar to that described for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> subjected to
          arterial shear. We propose that this could represent a
          physiologically-relevant mechanism by which resveratrol,
          as a polyphenolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, contributes to
          cardioprotection by inducing resistance to potential
          damage by shearing forces.
          The mechanism underlying this cytoskeletal
          rearrangement due to shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is ill-defined, but it
          has been found to be linked to tyrosine kinase activity,
          levels of intracellular calcium, intact actin
          microfilaments, and functional microtubule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, but
          is independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C, intermediate
          filaments, and stretch- and shear-activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanosensitive K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. We therefore sought
          to determine whether a similar mechanism could account
          for the resveratrol-mediated endothelial shape change.
          Our approach involved using a number of selective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> for various signaling pathway. These studies
          showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quin2</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AM</ENAMEX> ([Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX>), added together
          with resveratrol, clearly abolished the endothelial cell
          shape change induced by the polyphenol. In contrast,
          chelerythrine, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> inhibitor, which added alone
          triggered a significant shape change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX>, had no
          effect on resveratrol-elicited morphological change
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Analyzed as a whole, these experiments suggest
          that the change in cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>, as a consequence
          of resveratrol:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> interaction, is dependent on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+,
          tyrosine kinases, and intact actin microfilament and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubules</ENAMEX>. These results also raise the possibility
          that there is cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> within endothelial
          cells used in the studies, based on the fact that a
          subset displayed exquisite sensitivity to chelerythrine.
          Overall, these results support the notion that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resveratrol</ENAMEX> and shear stress induce elongation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          cytoskeleton via an overlapping outside-in signaling
          mechanism.
          Prolonged shear stress leading to mechanotransduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> has been shown to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>. Activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERK1 and ERK2</TIMEX>, the major
          components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway, presumably induces
          shear-specific transcription factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-fos/c-</ENAMEX>jun
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB, ultimately leading to changes in gene
          expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Western blot analysis of control
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼M</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> resveratrol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> showed
          that there was no increase in active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK 1/2</NUMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 day time</TIMEX> points. Rather, the decline in activated
          ERK 1/2 seen from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 2 to 4</TIMEX> of control cells, was
          effectively suppressed by resveratrol, suggesting that
          the polyphenol may act by affecting the stability of
          active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This may involve modulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> phosphatase-1 (MKP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
          immediate-early response gene product functioning as a
          dual specificity phosphase to reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 42</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>], by resveratrol. Previously, it has been reported
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MKP-1</ENAMEX> is rapidly induced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat carotid</ENAMEX> arterial
          wall following balloon catheter injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. Since no
          noticeable change in active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> occurred at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h or
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 day time</TIMEX> points, where morphological changes clearly
          became visible, following treatment with resveratrol, it
          seems unlikely that the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> is directly
          linked to the observed morphologic changes.
        
        
          Responses of cultured endothelial cells to arterial
          shear stress
          Another significant contribution of the present
          research is the demonstration that resveratrol promoted a
          greater adherence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> to the cultured vehicle 
          in vitro . 
          In vivo , such a cellular property
          could make endothelial cells less likely to dislodge to
          become part of a growing thrombotic plug. Restricted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detachment</ENAMEX> could also imply that there is less
          degeneration of the endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell monolayer</ENAMEX>, which, in
          turn, would reduce the exposure of the underlying
          subendothelial matrix components, thereby making platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and aggregation less likely. The mechanism(s)
          responsible for the resveratrol-induced cellular
          properties remain to be further investigated. One
          possibility centers on modulation of the number of focal
          contact adhesion sites, and/or the effective
          redistribution of the focal contacts, as well as the
          increased production of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>-specific integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
          by resveratrol, all of which could contribute to the
          cardioprotective mechanism of this polyphenol. However,
          it should be emphasized that these experiments involved
          growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX>, not on layers of subendothelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> such as collagen or fibrinogen. The
          latter experimental format simulating a more
          physiologically relevant subendothelial matrices may
          yield vastly different results. These possibilities
          warrant further investigation.
        
        
          Induction of eNOS and modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> growth by
          resveratrol
          The endothelial cell lining of the blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> is
          extremely sensitive to damage from reactive oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>), the results of which are losses of both
          microvascular metabolic function and barrier properties [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>]. To minimize such oxidant damage, cells rely on the
          production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> (NO) by the enzyme nitric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide synthase</ENAMEX> (eNOS). Biological functions attributed to
          NO include vasodilation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>], inhibition of platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and aggregation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], reduction of expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules and chemokines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50, 51, 52</TIMEX>],
          and suppression of cell growth and migration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54</TIMEX>].
          Therefore, we investigated whether resveratrol treatment
          could lead to increased eNOS expression in endothelial
          cells. We determined that resveratrol treatment did
          induce eNOS expression at all time points tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 h, 2</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>). These results agreed with a previous
          report from this laboratory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The peak expression of
          eNOS occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M resveratrol-treated
          cells. These findings could mean that dietary resveratrol
          is capable of providing a gradual yet sustained increase
          in NO. The ability of resveratrol to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> growth arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>] suggests an
          additional mechanism for cells to rapidly and efficiently
          repair any endothelial cell damage. Overall, the
          collective effect of resveratrol would be to decrease
          endothelial injury and exposure of the subendothelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>, which would lessen the probability of formation
          of atherosclerotic plaques and the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54, 55</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our studies suggest that resveratrol interacts with
        endothelial cells 
        in vitro to elicit morphological and
        functional changes. Specifically, resveratrol induced an
        elongated shape, interspersed with long, tortuous
        projections, in cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX>. Treated cells resisted
        detachment from the plastic coverslips under simulated
        arterial shear stress conditions. These results, combined
        with data from our previous studies, provide additional
        support for the notion that resveratrol acts as an
        anti-atherosclerotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Whether these findings can be
        extrapolated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> require further study.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Cell culture and treatment with resveratrol
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPAEC</ENAMEX> isolated from the distal main intrapulmonary
          artery of calf lungs were cultured in minimal essential
          medium (MEM) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum and
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-valine as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>].
          Plastic coverslips on which the cells were cultured were
          sterilized by washing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, followed by rinsing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min exposure to UV radiation.
          The coverslips were placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-well tissue culture
          plates, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of the cells, at an initial density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ã— 10 5cells/ml</ENAMEX>, were added to each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> h after seeding, the coverslips were treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,10</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 50</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> resveratrol and maintained
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> until they were fixed and stained for
          confocal microscopy.
        
        
          Preparation and staining of slides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Coverslips</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adhered BPAEC</ENAMEX> were washed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min in TBS</ENAMEX>, fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cacodylate</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, washed again for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBS</ENAMEX>, then stored in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> cacodylate<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">/7%</NUMEX> sucrose at 4Â°C
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">staining</TIMEX>. Cells were permeabilized with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100/TBS</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX>, washed twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBS</ENAMEX>, blocked twice
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> bovine serum albumin in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBS</ENAMEX>, and
          incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min. Routinely</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rhodamine-phalloidin</ENAMEX>, dissolved
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBS</ENAMEX>, was used for each coverslip stained. The
          coverslips were wash with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA/TBS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX>, then
          mounted in an inverted position onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBS</ENAMEX>-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beveled</ENAMEX> glass slides and sealed with clear nail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">polish</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Perfusion
          A parallel plate perfusion chamber as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] was used to generate simulated arterial
          flow conditions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pieces:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rectangular slabs and a central knob with a
          depression that fits <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 by 21 mm</NUMEX> coverslips. The
          depression containing the coverslip was placed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perpendicularly</ENAMEX> to the flow of perfusate. A laminar
          arterial shear rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> s -1was achieved based on the
          dimensions of the flow chamber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slit</ENAMEX> and a constant flow
          rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min. After preincubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, minimal
          medium was drawn directly by an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller</ENAMEX> peristaltic
          pump through the perfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> containing the
          BPAEC-covered coverslip positioned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mm from the inlet
          valve at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min for either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recirculating</ENAMEX> system was employed to recycle the medium
          after passing through the chamber.
        
        
          Confocal microscopy
          Prepared slides containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adhered BPAEC</ENAMEX> were examined
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX> confocal microscope. The cells were imaged
          following excitation of rhodamine-phalloidin with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">argon</ENAMEX> laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> at a wavelength of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">554</NUMEX> nm using either
          an inverted- or an uprighted-staged microscope equipped
          with either a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10X</NUMEX> or a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-free objective and an
          epifluorescent illumination attachment. Cells viewed in
          representative field screen captures were counted
          manually for cell morphology and classified as either
          normal or elongated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inhibitor</ENAMEX> study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Passages 4-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">BPAEC</ENAMEX> were seeded on plastic coverslips
          as described above. Inhibitor concentrations were the
          same as in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Stock solutions were prepared by
          dissolving the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> used
          and their stock solutions were as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quin2</NUMEX>-AM
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM), herbimycin A (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.175 mM</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chelerythrine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4 mM</NUMEX>), cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>), nocodazole (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.66 mM</NUMEX>). Quin2-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AM</ENAMEX>, herbimycin A,
          chelerythrine, and cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>,
          and nocodazole was stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. The stock solutions
          were diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:200 in MEM</TIMEX> to give the following final
          concentrations: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quin2</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX>), herbimycin A (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">875 nM</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chelerythrine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼M</ENAMEX>), cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 nM</NUMEX>), nocodazole
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.3 Î¼M</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Inhibitors</ENAMEX> were applied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h prior to the
          addition of resveratrol, except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quin2</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AM</ENAMEX>, which was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied 1 h</ENAMEX> prior to resveratrol treatment. Since cells
          treated with various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> grew less well, compared
          to controls, treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> resveratrol was
          reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Fixing</ENAMEX> and staining of
          cells for confocal microscopy was as described above.
        
        
          Western blot analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> and treated cells were lysed by repeated
          freeze-thaw cycles with buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> (pH

          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml each of the protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors aprotinin</ENAMEX>,
          pepstatin, and leupeptin. Cell-free extracts were
          obtained by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Lysates
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-10 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) from control and treated cells were separated
          on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. The separated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were transferred
          to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were
          incubated with the respective primary and secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. The monoclonal primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used and
          their dilutions were as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphorylated</ENAMEX>, active
          ERK1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/2-P</ENAMEX> (RBI/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1000</ENAMEX>), total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> (RBI/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>,

          Membranes were probed with alkaline
          phosphatase-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1500</ENAMEX>) or

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:2000</ENAMEX>). Specific immunoreactive bands were identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> reaction or enhanced chemiluminescence,
          respectively.
