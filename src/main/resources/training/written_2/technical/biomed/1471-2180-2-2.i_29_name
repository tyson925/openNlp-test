        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Johne's disease</ENAMEX>, also called paratuberculosis, is a
        chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> caused
        by 
        Mycobacterium avium subspecies 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> ). While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johne</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> can end in death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, the economic impact
        of this disease is much more significant [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Losses
        are estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200/clinically</NUMEX> infected cow/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> and
        are a result of animal culling, reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> production,
        poor reproductive performance, and reduced carcass value [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ] . Research on the pathogenesis and immunology of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis infections of
        cattle is necessary to allow design of more rational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> and control procedures.
        A small number of specialized microorganisms can survive
        inside macrophages designed specifically to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        However, a hallmark of mycobacterial pathogenesis is their
        ability to survive, and even replicate, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">macrophages</TIMEX>.
        These include 
        Mycobacteria, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Listeria</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coxiella</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corynebacteria</ENAMEX>. Different mechanisms
        are employed as survival strategies and the mycobacteria
        are exceptional in the duration and persistence of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX>. Survival of pathogenic mycobacteria is
        attributed to the fact that the mycobacterial phagosome
        does not fuse with lysosomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . The mechanism that
        prevents phagosome maturation is still unknown as are any
        mycobacterial genes that contribute to the delayed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX>.
        Several studies surrounding the interactions of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis with macrophages
        have been published because of its importance in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenesis</ENAMEX>. These studies include entry into J774
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , an electron microscopic examination
        of goat tissue [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] and an assessment of intracellular
        fate of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis within bovine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">monocytes/macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . However, many assumptions
        regarding 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis interactions with
        macrophages are based on analogies to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, we present an analysis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis survival within
        J774 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> using transmission electron microscopy to
        show temporal events early during infection.

          Viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosiswithin resting J774
          macrophages
          The growth of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> was measured at
          early stages during infection of non-activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. Growth was measured by bacterial cell counts
          following serial dilutions on HEYM slants. The cell
          counts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent experiments showed a slow
          decline in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis viability over
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). After infection, an initial growth phase
          occurred until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> postinfection where mycobacterial
          counts began to decline. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experiments,
          an increase in bacterial counts occurred after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 hours</TIMEX>
          postinfection up until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">95 hours</TIMEX> where a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> decline in
          viable mycobacteria occurred. These data suggest that
          while 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis survives much
          longer in macrophages than some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogens</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ]
          including other species of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , there
          remains a significant decrease in viability over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunoelectron microscopy of intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          paratuberculosis
          Because the viability of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> decreased with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, it was of interest to examine the progression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis infection by
          immunoelectron microscopy. However, a reliable method to
          label intracellular mycobacteria needed to be developed
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Therefore rabbit antibodies against a whole cell
          sonicated lysate of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis were affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX>. These purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> labeled the outer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periphery of Middlebrook</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7H9</ENAMEX> cultured 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). This
          purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> preparation was then used to label 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis within infected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>). The purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was
          highly specific as all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles are associated with
          the mycobacteria and no labeling of the surrounding
          background or macrophages was observed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>
          preparations of uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> failed to label
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Note the mycobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphology</ENAMEX> remained
          constant when comparing intracellular with extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacilli</ENAMEX> (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2Bwith Fig 2C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Temporal events during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosisinfection
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J774</ENAMEX> macrophages
          Macrophages were infected with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio
          and fixed in glutaraldehyde at various time points to
          examine the development of mycobacteria in this
          environment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Vacuoles harboring mycobacteria
          appeared tightly arranged and not spacious as previously
          observed in 
          Coxiella burnetii containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . The mycobacteria themselves were in
          very close contact with each other. The size, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>, and
          morphology of the mycobacteria appeared to remain
          relatively constant throughout the observed time period.
          At all times postinfection, mycobacteria were mostly
          found as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> inside vacoules. Occasionally, single
          bacilli were observed within a tight vacuole. An increase
          in the percentage of degraded mycobacteria was observed
          with time. There were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two degraded bacilli</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> fields
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> postinfection and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 degraded bacilli</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          fields at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX> postinfection. Similar data were
          obtained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent experiments. Degraded
          mycobacteria were morphologically unrecognizable, but did
          label with immunogold, indicating the presence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These data indicate that macrophages can kill and
          degrade a percentage of mycobacterial cells in a given
          infection.
          We next examined the outcome of mycobacteria within
          heavily infected macrophages. J774 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> were
          infected with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis at high
          multiplicities of infection (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and examined at
          various times post-infection (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Extracellular
          mycobacteria were phagocytosed via actin rearrangement
          and remain within phagosomal vacuoles dispersed
          throughout the cytoplasm (fig. 5Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5B</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 20</NUMEX>
          infected macrophages were examined at each time point.
          Note the electron transparent lipid vesicles present
          within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis. These electron
          transparent vesicles were seen at all time points
          examined. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48 hr postinfection</NUMEX> (fig. 5C), the cytoplasm
          of the macrophage is loaded with mycobacterial-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX>. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr postinfection, the macrophage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> is dark and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> appears necrotic, possibly
          due to the heavy mycobacterial load or apoptosis. Severe
          membrane sloughing or blebbing seen to the right of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophage</ENAMEX> and identified by the arrows in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Dis a
          sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . No degraded mycobacteria
          were observed in these experiments. Therefore, at high
          levels of infection, it appears that mycobacteria survive
          while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> macrophage is killed. Whereas the outcome
          is reversed at lower moi.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Growth and survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mycobacterial species</ENAMEX> within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> has been an area of intensive study because of
        its implications in pathogenicity. For example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. bovis</ENAMEX> has been shown to grow
        within macrophages whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCG</ENAMEX> strains do not [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> is controversial since there are reports of
        immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with disseminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCG</ENAMEX>. Although
        multi-species studies are complex and multi-factorial, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> appears to be able to
        survive in secondary lysosomes better than does 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">macrophages</ENAMEX> co-infected with 
        Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular
        pathogen known to inhabit and replicate within secondary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysosomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium growth was not impaired [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] . Whereas 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis bacilli that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localized with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> burnetii containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuoles</ENAMEX>, did
        show reduced growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . A recent report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomsen et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] showed a higher percentage of degraded 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis in euthymic as
        compared to athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The in vivo study by Thomsen
        supports data from our in vitro study, indicating that J774
        cultured macrophages are a good model for pathogenesis
        studies.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> are rapidly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endocytosed</ENAMEX> and digested by macrophages within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postinfection</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The present study showed an initial
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 hour</TIMEX> intracellular growth period of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> followed by a
        slow decline in the viability within macrophages over a
        period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>. This survival curve is similar to that
        observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhao et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] which showed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis intracellular
        growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six days</TIMEX> followed by killing after day
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six</TIMEX>. The experiments described herein were performed using
        the type strain of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX>, which may have
        affected the survivability within macrophages since it is
        not a recent field isolate. However, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6783</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BO45</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] are
        field isolates that have both showed a decline in viability
        inside macrophages over time, although much slower than
        observed with the type strain. No attempt has been made to
        activate the macrophages in this study, although several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> have shown that macrophages activated with
        cytokines such as interferon-γ increase the ability to kill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        A very recent communication of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis interactions with
        macrophages was published during the course of our
        experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . This comprehensive study showed that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis -containing
        vacuoles were mildly acidified (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX>) as compared to
        latex beads (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2</NUMEX>). In addition, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis phagosome was
        characterized by the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LAMP 1</ENAMEX> and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAMP</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> lysosomal membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> markers as well as other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endocytic tracer</ENAMEX> molecules. These cell biology studies
        clearly add to our understanding of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis interactions with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>.
        This study has also provided a general description of
        early events in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis infection of
        cultured macrophages. Several intracellular pathogens such
        as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydia</ENAMEX> or 
        Coxiella undergo readily
        distinguishable morphological changes during infection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . This is clearly not the case for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis or other
        mycobacteria as they remain morphologically similar at
        least up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> postinfection. However, an increased
        percentage of degraded mycobacterial forms was observed
        over time. These degraded forms appeared by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postinfection</ENAMEX> and were hardly recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphologically</ENAMEX>,
        but did label with immunogold particles indicating the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mycobacterial antigen</ENAMEX>. At low moi, the bacilli
        were tightly clustered into a single vacuole throughout the
        observed time period. This mycobacterial vacuole is most
        likely characteristic of a late endosome, based on previous
        studies with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ]
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        All intracellular bacterial pathogens enter host cells
        surrounded by a membrane bound vacuole [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . Some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX> in heavily infected cells collect into a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuole</ENAMEX> within the same cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . J774 macrophages
        infected at a moi of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> showed separate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis -containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> within the same macrophage even after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postinfection</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Likewise, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> appear to remain in distinct
        phagosomes that do not harbor <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one bacilli</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuole</ENAMEX> (see Figures <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1Aand 4Bin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] for example).
        However, in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium -infected macrophages, one
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phenotypic alterations following activation
        with cytokines is the coalescence of individual 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium -containing</ENAMEX> vacuoles into
        communal vacuoles with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bacilli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The
        significance of separate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis -containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vacuoles</ENAMEX> observed in this study is still unclear.
        There appears to be a tenuous relationship to gain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and the
        macrophage with survival at stake. The macrophage can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> growth and even kill 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis. However, the
        mycobacteria are cytotoxic to macrophages or induce
        apoptosis at high moi. The mechanism that enables 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis to persist within
        cattle for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> remains unclear as high moi are
        not likely observed at early stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Johne's disease</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In vitro assays to quantify survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in
        macrophages provide useful insights into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-pathogen
        relations. The results of this study provides further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> surrounding 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis -macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> and have implications in the pathogenesis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX>, a pathogen known
        to persist inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. Further studies
        need to address the tenuous relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> and macrophage in relation to disease
        outcome.
