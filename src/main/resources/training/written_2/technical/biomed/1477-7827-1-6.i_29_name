        That maternal undernutrition can affect fetal ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> has been documented [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Experiments using
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> as a paradigm indicate that meiotic maturation of
        germ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is delayed by feed restriction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] ;
        putative molecular mechanisms which mediate this effect are
        unknown. We hypothesized that fetal oogonia distressed as a
        result of nutrient deprivation express the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein p53</ENAMEX>. Cells respond to p53 by cycle arrest at the
        G1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/S</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX>. Outcome is dictated by
        the intensity of the affliction. The apoptotic pathway is
        invoked in cells subjected to a severe trauma that causes
        irreparable damages. In the presence of sublethal
        disturbances to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> affords the time necessary for
        enzymatic repairs and proof-reading. Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, the
        so-called "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> of the genome," serves to maintain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic fidelity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        There is a lack of fundamental information on potential
        influences of undernutrition on the functional morphology
        of ovaries of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The corpus luteum provides
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormonal</ENAMEX> support essential for the establishment
        and maintenance of early pregnancy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Follicles
        undergo cycles of antral development and atresia throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        The primary objective of this investigation was to
        compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> responses of germ cells in fetal ovaries of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ewes</ENAMEX> receiving adequate or restricted diets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alterations</ENAMEX> in
        p53 were related to accretions of
        apoptotic/internucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the
        oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> stress marker <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-oxoguanine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , the
        survival protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and base-excision repair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">polymerase β</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Corpora lutea were evaluated for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and steroidogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and vascular
        compositions. Tertiary follicles were quantified and
        maternal oocytes were assessed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> and diets

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> which did not return to estrus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) were
          weighed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 20</TIMEX> and dietary intakes calculated on a dry

          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early gestation</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX>). Feeding in individual pens
          commenced on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 21</TIMEX>. Ewes were assigned on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 28</TIMEX> to a

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> intervals until slaughter (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 78 ±</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9</NUMEX>).
          Pregnancies were confirmed by ultrasonography on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 45</TIMEX>.

          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and in one restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Processing of samples
          Maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were collected by jugular
          venipuncture on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of slaughter, placed into
          heparinized tubes, and mixed by inverting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plasma</ENAMEX> was
          harvested from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> after centrifugation and stored at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          Parameters recorded after slaughter included: weights
          of ewes, fetuses, maternal and fetal ovaries, and

          Fetal ovaries, corpora lutea, and maternal

        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ewes</ENAMEX> in the restricted-diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> weighed less at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slaughter than</ENAMEX> controls. Fetal weights also were reduced by
        nutritional deprivation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        There were no salient differences observed in the
        histoarchitecture of ovaries recovered from fetal lambs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and restricted ewes. Surface epithelia of ovaries
        consisted of cuboidal cells; a definitive basal lamina
        (which eventually supports and separates surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> from
        the ovarian cortical interstitium) was not readily
        discernible. Germ cells were typically spherical in shape,
        contained a conspicuous centrally-located nucleus, were
        larger than other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-types, and were organized into
        clusters or cords sometimes associated with progenitor
        granulosa cells. Evidence of apoptotic oogonial
        degeneration was apparent (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of cells)
        within ovaries of both nutritional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        There were no significant influences of nutrition on
        weights of fetal ovaries or tissue concentrations of germ
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Increases above controls in immunoreactive
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-oxoguanine</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX>, and polymerase β were detected in
        germ cells of fetal ovaries from diet-limited ewes. No
        group differences in rates of apoptosis as indicated by
        immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments were detected. Levels of p53
        in maternal oocytes were not altered overall (irrespective
        of follicular classification) by undernutrition (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>);
        and therefore, we did not monitor the inductive damage
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-oxoguanine</ENAMEX>) or response survival (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX>)/repair
        (polymerase β) markers.
        Additional data relative to maternal ovaries and jugular
        plasma sex steroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">determinations</ENAMEX> are compiled in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Weights of maternal ovaries and (dissected)
        corpora lutea were not influenced by nutritional status.
        Numbers of corpora lutea and fetuses diagnosed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ultrasound</ENAMEX> matched the number of fetuses retrieved at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slaughter</ENAMEX> (i.e., no embryonic/fetal losses occurred during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX> or due to treatments). Ovaries of control ewes
        contained more follicles <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm or greater in diameter than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> receiving restricted diets; albeit, there was no
        significant difference in jugular venous concentrations of
        estradiol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17β</NUMEX>. Likewise, there was no differential effect
        of treatments on peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>. Luteal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and tissue areas occupied by blood vessels and
        large and small steroidogenic cells were similar between

        Discussion
        Results of this study indicate that in underfed ewes
        p53, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX>, and polymerase β are up-regulated in fetal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oogonia</ENAMEX> containing elevated contents of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-oxoguanine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxoguanine</ENAMEX> has become the benchmark for oxidative DNA
        modifications; it is arguably the most important mutagenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (mispairing with adenine during chromosomal
        replications causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GC → TA transversions</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . It is
        suggested that untoward oxidative stresses to DNA prompt
        cell-cycle delay, antiapoptotic, and repair responses.
        Indeed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> controls the low-level damage-dependent
        premeiotic checkpoint which facilitates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spermatogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gametogenesis</ENAMEX> is inherently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">error-prone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and subject to mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, it is imperative to avoid genotoxic
        complications that could become integrated into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germline</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> belongs to a family of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which
        arbitrate decisions in life-or-death situations. In the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX>, irregularities within the DNA sequence
        are corrected before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p53</TIMEX> suicidal program is executed.
        Bcl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> impedes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subcellular</ENAMEX> trafficking of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, inhibits
        downstream adapters necessary for stimulation of the
        apoptotic caspases, and can act as an antioxidant [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 28</NUMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polymerase β</ENAMEX> is a penultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of mammalian DNA
        base-excision repair. The base-excision cascade is
        characteristically limited to the repair of small lesions
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (e.g., single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> modifications). Short-patch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> is initiated by a proof-reading glycosylase
        that hydrolyzes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycosylic bond linking an improper
        base to deoxyribose. The abasic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-phosphate backbone is
        then cleaved by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apurinic</ENAMEX>/apyrimidinic endonuclease or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lyase</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polymerase β</ENAMEX> fills the nucleotide gap created in DNA
        with the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate complementary to
        the template. Finally, the nick is sealed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligase</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . The base-excision pathway is a principal contributor
        to the amendment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-oxoguanine corruptions in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, which continue to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm cells</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mitosis</ENAMEX> throughout their reproductive lives, mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are generally born with their full complement of
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">meiotic</NUMEX>) gametes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The normal chronology of ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> follows a definitive pattern. Critical windows
        of activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> include: somatic ovarian tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> (from the gonadal ridges of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesonephros</ENAMEX>) and growth (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to Day 50</TIMEX> of gestation); germ
        (from yolk sac endoderm) and pregranulosa (derived from the
        ovarian surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>) cellular migration into and
        colonization of the ovaries (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 30-65</TIMEX>); clonal expansion
        of oogonia (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 35-75</TIMEX>); onset of meiosis and arrest (by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 80</TIMEX>) at the dictyate stage of prophase (the first
        division of meiosis is not completed until ovulation); and
        ovigerous cord regression and primordial follicle emergence
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 65-110</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 31 32 33</ENAMEX> ] . It seems apparent that germ
        cells are particularly vulnerable to a metabolic insult
        when in the phasic transition between mitosis and meiosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
        Relatively innocuous base damages to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> caused by
        oxidations are an inevitable by-product of physiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (e.g., leakage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> associated with the
        reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> during mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiration</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The etiological basis for the
        formation of abnormally high levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-oxoguanine adducts
        in oogonia of lambs of undernourished ewes is unknown.
        Altered placental vascular dynamics and shifts in fetal
        organ blood flow precipitated by nutrient deficiencies are
        of possible significance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Ischemia-reperfusion is a
        well known stimulus of free radical formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        Micronutrient imbalances or insufficiencies also can
        negatively impact the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capacities</ENAMEX> of antioxidant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin</ENAMEX> (C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) and enzymatic (superoxide dismutase,
        glutathione peroxidase, catalase) defense systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        .
        While cellular proliferation is a generic feature of
        normal germline development, so is programmed physiological
        death. In fact, the apoptotic demise (yielding
        double-stranded DNA breaks) of female germ cells throughout
        gestations of most vertebrates will encompass more than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-half</ENAMEX> of precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 75</TIMEX> is the
        approximate time-point when a maximum number of oogonia is
        achieved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lambs</TIMEX>; a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly five</NUMEX>-fold loss then occurs
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Days 75 and 90</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . In some cases of
        nutritional deprivation cellular losses are accelerated [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] and reproductive performance of the female offspring
        during adulthood is attenuated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Prenatal exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">famine</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944-45</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> cohort) did not affect subsequent
        fertility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oogonia</ENAMEX>/oocytes and
        weights of mid-gestational fetal ovaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> were
        increased [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 42</ENAMEX> ] or not influenced by undernutrition [ [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] , present study]. It has been suggested that oogonia
        which have matured to oocytes are less susceptible to
        degeneration as pregnancy advances [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . A prominent role
        for the aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon receptor</ENAMEX> (e.g., which is
        responsive to polycyclic ligands present in environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicants</ENAMEX>) in promoting apoptosis during fetal oogenesis
        has recently been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] .
        Prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endocrine</ENAMEX>/paracrine modifiers (which are
        altered by nutritional regimen) of the fates of fetal germ
        cells include glucocorticoids, thyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>,
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, insulin-like growth factors, and leptin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ] .
        The physiological relevance, if any, of the diminution
        in numbers of surface antral ovarian follicles in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX> of
        the restricted nutrition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is unclear - this was not
        reflected by a perturbation in circulatory estradiol-17β.
        Structural and functional properties of ovine corpora lutea
        of pregnancy were not altered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of nutrition.
        Moreover, maternal nutrient restriction during the middle
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of gestation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> had no effect on ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production or fetal survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        Morphometric data for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep corpora</ENAMEX> lutea are consistent
        with previous reports summarized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . It
        therefore appears that maternal ovaries are comparatively
        resilient to repercussions of undernutrition.
        In conclusion, we surmise that oxidative base damages to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of fetal oogonia of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> faced with a
        nutritional adversity are a potential threat to the genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and reproductive capacity of their progeny; the
        predicament can evidently be reconciled by response
        mechanisms of cell-cycle arrest, survival, and repair.
        Evolutionary pressures to resist or adapt to the stresses
        of caloric constraints have almost certainly served to
        assure the successes of mammalian reproduction (natural
        selection) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
