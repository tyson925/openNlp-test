        Development of the male genitalia is largely controlled
        by cells in the urogenital mesenchyme that express androgen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (AR) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Germline mutations of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene produce a spectrum of
        developmental abnormalities in 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> ranging
        from infertility or mild hypospadias to complete
        feminization, which are collectively referred to as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">androgen insensitivity syndrome</ENAMEX> (AIS). In general, the
        degree of genital ambiguity correlates with the level of
        compromise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> function: 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        AR-inactivating mutations are completely feminized despite
        high levels of serum testosterone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        The molecular events responsible for AR-dependent male
        genital morphogenesis are poorly understood. We
        hypothesized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>-dependent mesenchymal programs
        underlying male external genitalia development might be
        illuminated by comparing the transcriptional profile of
        mesenchyme-derived stromal cells from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to those
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>. As cultured genital
        fibroblasts originate from the urogenital mesenchyme and
        retain expression of the AR 
        in vitro , we compared
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns in cultured genital fibroblasts
        from normal 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and from 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with severe
        or complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,968</NUMEX>
        distinct human genes. We found striking differences in the
        gene expression profiles of genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> cultured
        from normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but no transcriptional
        response to androgen was detectable in any of the cultured
        genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Baseline gene transcription in genital
          fibroblasts
          To gain insights into the role of androgen in genital
          morphogenesis, we compared basal transcriptional patterns
          in genital fibroblasts from 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with either
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX> or germline inactivation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> as a
          result of mutation. We could not identify mutations in
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR gene</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phenotypically
          female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>. However, genital
          skin fibroblasts of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> failed to express AR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and did not show androgen binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Initially, we restricted our analysis to genital skin
          fibroblasts grown from the foreskin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> normal males
          and from the labia majora of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> AIS-affected, 46,XY
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with female external genitalia. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">AR</ENAMEX> status
          of all genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> was confirmed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene sequencing and
          hormone-binding assays (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). To determine basal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns, mRNA was isolated from
          growth-arrested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) confluent cells and analyzed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarrays of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 43,000</NUMEX> cDNAs
          representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,968</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Distinct differences in the
          basal expression profiles of normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AIS-</ENAMEX>derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> allowed these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to be distinguished
          on the basis of their expression patterns by unsupervised
          hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We then
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX> unique transcripts (represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">487</NUMEX>
          total cDNAs) with significant differences in expression
          levels between normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> genital fibroblasts using
          the significance analysis of microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>)-procedure
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , with a false discovery rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 0.92%</NUMEX>
          (percent of genes identified by chance alone).
          We used the list of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">487</NUMEX> cDNAs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
          analysis for hierarchical clustering analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          different primary fibroblast lines from normal and AIS
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">genital-</ENAMEX>skin fibroblast lines used to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
          list, we included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> gonadal fibroblast lines from
          46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>, a prostate fibroblast
          cell line from a normal male (analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>), abdominal
          skin fibroblasts from a normal male, forearm fibroblasts
          from a normal male, and genital fibroblasts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> AIS
          46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> who had documented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> mosaicism (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ARD364,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">465</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ARD364</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ARD465</NUMEX> lines express
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX> and were derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were
          mosaics for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> with a premature stop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Hierarchical cluster analysis, based on the
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">487</NUMEX> previously identified
          transcripts with measurable expression across at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> experiments, separated the fibroblasts into
          those with gene-expression patterns resembling normal
          male foreskin fibroblasts and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with an
          expression pattern more similar to labial skin
          fibroblasts from AIS-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          latter group contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> gonadal fibroblast lines
          from complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> as well as the fibroblast lines
          from abdominal and forearm skin. The prostate
          fibroblasts, on the other hand, displayed expression
          patterns largely similar to the normal male foreskin
          cells. Notably, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mosaic AIS cell lines ARD364 and
          ARD465 showed gene-expression patterns that most
          resembled normal male foreskin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Comparison of expression patterns in genital
          fibroblasts from normal and AIS-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and
          fibroblasts from extragenital sites, offers possible
          insights into the programs that underlie genital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. For instance, transcripts encoding homeobox
          A13 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HOXA13</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (TBX) showed
          striking differences in their expression levels between
          the 'male genital' and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'AIS</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extragenital</ENAMEX>' fibroblasts. 
          HOXA13 was expressed at high levels
          in normal male foreskin fibroblasts and at low levels in
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> and extragenital fibroblasts (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T-box</ENAMEX>
          gene 3 ( 
          TBX3 ) was expressed at higher
          levels in the fibroblasts from genital skin, extragenital
          skin or prostate from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> than in genital skin
          fibroblasts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">46,XY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). 
          TBX2 showed an almost identical
          expression profile to 
          TBX3 , whereas high 
          TBX5 expression appeared to be
          restricted to foreskin fibroblasts from normal males
          (including those from the phenotypically female mosaic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">patient ARD364</ENAMEX>). 
          BMP4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic protein 4</ENAMEX>)
          was predominantly expressed in foreskin fibroblasts from
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and in prostate fibroblasts (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). 
          WNT2 (wingless-type MMTV
          integration site family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> 2) was part of a small
          gene cluster with high expression in normal male foreskin
          fibroblasts that distinguished these samples from all
          other fibroblasts (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Compared to genital and gonadal fibroblasts from 46,XY
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX>, fibroblasts from normal male genital tissues
          showed pronounced differences in expression of cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix genes</ENAMEX>. For example,
          cadherin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ( 
          CDH13 ), versican ( 
          CSPG2 ), collagen 8A1 ( 
          COL8A1 ), collagen 12A1 ( 
          COL12A1 ), 
          P4HA2 (encoding a
          procollagen-modifying enzyme) all showed relatively low
          expression in the genital skin fibroblasts of normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, whereas tenascin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XB</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNXB</ENAMEX> ), nidogen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          NID2 ), laminins ( 
          LAMA3 , 
          LAMA4 ) and tissue inhibitor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinase</ENAMEX> 1 ( 
          TIMP1 ) all showed relatively high
          expression levels compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AIS-</ENAMEX>derived fibroblasts
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Several of the differentially expressed
          genes, including aldo-keto reductase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1C1</TIMEX> ( 
          AKR1C1 ), aldehyde dehydrogenase
          1A1 ( 
          ALDH1A1 ), and alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1B</ENAMEX> ( 
          ADH1B ), function in sex steroid
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid metabolism</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, such as mitogen-activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ( 
          MAP3K14 ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT-induced STAT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ( 
          STATI2 , 
          SSI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ), encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved
          in intracellular signal transduction.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcriptional</ENAMEX> response of cultured genital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to androgen treatment
          We tested the responses of normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> genital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), under culture
          conditions similar to those that were reported to produce
          aromatase induction in these cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Cells were
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-1,000 nM</NUMEX>) both at confluency (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) and during exponential growth, and
          transcript levels were assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX>.
          Unsupervised hierarchical clustering did not disclose any
          obvious differences in gene-expression patterns between
          DHT-treated and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol-</ENAMEX>treated fibroblasts, either in
          normal controls or in AIS-derived cell lines. We treated
          LNCaP prostate cancer cells with androgen under similar
          conditions and readily identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 500</NUMEX> transcripts
          modulated by androgen with unsupervised hierarchical
          clustering analysis and with supervised methods ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          and data not shown). A supervised analysis comparing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHT-</ENAMEX>treated fibroblasts to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol-</ENAMEX>treated controls was carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
          procedure. Again, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be identified that were
          significantly induced or repressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DHT</ENAMEX> treatment.
          Additional experiments using physiological concentrations
          of androgen (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM methyltrienolone)
          also failed to disclose any androgen-responsive genes
          (data not shown). In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> analysis identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,664</NUMEX> transcripts that differed significantly between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferating</ENAMEX> and confluent cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,232</NUMEX> transcripts
          that differed between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> derived from
          AIS-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and normal male foreskin.
          Hierarchical cluster analysis of these experiments
          clearly showed the distinct differences in
          transcriptional profiles between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>-derived and normal
          male fibroblasts and between proliferating and normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Cells derived from the same
          individual and cultured under the same conditions always
          showed highly similar gene-expression patterns,
          suggesting that the differences in expression between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are stable and reproducible despite passage 
          in vitro (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We found consistent, characteristic differences in
        baseline gene expression patterns between genital skin
        fibroblasts from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,XY</NUMEX> female patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>. Many of these differences between normal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AIS-</ENAMEX>derived fibroblasts were also observed in gonadal
        fibroblasts, suggesting that these differences are not
        purely due to differences in the anatomical site of origin
        of the fibroblasts. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> derived from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abdominal</ENAMEX> and forearm skin, regions with relatively little
        sexual dimorphism, showed gene-expression patterns similar
        to the labial skin fibroblasts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Together,
        these data suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> is involved in determining a
        stable and stereotypical program of gene expression in
        genital fibroblasts that does not require the continuing
        presence of androgen for its maintenance.
        A critical question raised by these results is whether
        the observed differences between genital fibroblasts from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> reflect cell-autonomous effects of
        androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> during development, or indirect effects
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>-dependent genital morphogenetic program. One
        possible interpretation of these data is that the distinct
        patterns of expression could have been due to differences
        in the origin or the developmental milieu of foreskin
        fibroblasts, derived from the genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tubercle</ENAMEX>, as opposed
        to the labial fibroblasts, derived from the genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swellings</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The differences in gene expression we
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> fibroblasts of gonadal origin compared to
        those of labial origin support this view (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We
        have observed consistent and characteristic differences in
        the gene-expression patterns of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> derived
        from different locations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . However, the
        current set of experiments suggests that the androgen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> has a cell-autonomous role which contributes to a
        stable androgen-independent gene-expression pattern in
        genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Expression patterns in cultured labial
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> mosaicism suggested that the cell-autonomous AR
        status was a relevant determinant of baseline gene
        expression in genital skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Both these
        fibroblast lines, although derived from morphologically
        female genitalia in phenotypically female 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        mosaic for AR-inactivating mutations, expressed wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> in the cultured cells. These female AIS-affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are thought to have acquired their 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene mutations post-zygotically [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . ARD364, which showed AR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression and
        binding in the range of normal male foreskin fibroblasts (
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), despite its origin from
        anatomically female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genitalia</ENAMEX>, had a gene-expression
        pattern indistinguishable from foreskin fibroblasts of
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fibroblast line from an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ARD465</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), had very low wild-type
        AR expression and showed baseline gene-expression patterns
        that were nevertheless more similar to normal male foreskin
        and prostate fibroblasts than to any of the AIS-derived
        cell lines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The discrepancy between the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> of these
        mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> despite expression of the wild-type AR
        in cultured genital skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> is not resolved to
        date [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . It may be explained by a time-dependent rise
        of an originally small fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing the
        wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> allele in the mosaic genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> during prenatal and postnatal development, or by
        differences between 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro conditions. Yet, the
        documented expression of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX> in cultures of
        these labial cells supports the idea that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">AR</ENAMEX> status of
        the fibroblast was an important intrinsic determinant of
        the basal transcription patterns we identified. Therefore,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> appears to be involved in setting long-lasting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns in genital skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of gene-expression patterns in genital
        fibroblasts from normal and AIS-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and
        in fibroblasts from extragenital sites, may offer clues to
        the programs that underlie external genital development.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX> and connective tissue remodeling are
        indispensable for normal development and maintenance of
        tissue integrity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . The differential expression
        of proteoglycans, collagens and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecules
        (for example cadherin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) might be involved in genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> and later stability of sexually dimorphic
        traits of the external genitalia. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in
        wild-type AR cells could influence androgen signaling. For
        instance, aldo-keto reductase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1C1</ENAMEX> is specifically involved
        in cellular androgen metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and thus may
        modulate the spectrum of cellular androgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>
        available for activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>. Structurally different
        androgens elicit different patterns of response from
        several androgen-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the
        type of ligand present could affect cellular response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        ] . Mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STAT</ENAMEX>-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT inhibitors 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were expressed at significantly
        higher levels in cells with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX>. Both MAP kinase
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT pathways</ENAMEX> are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>-dependent regulation
        and in ligand-independent activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Differential expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol dehydrogenase 1B</ENAMEX>, enzymes that affect retinoic acid
        biosynthesis, suggest that other signaling pathways may
        participate in the AR-initiated programs of external
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genital differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed specifically in the normal male
        foreskin fibroblasts have been previously implicated in
        male genital development, including 
        HOXA13 , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>box genes, 
        BMP4 and 
        DWnt2 . Mutations in 
        HOXA13 can cause distal limb and
        urogenital-tract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malformations</ENAMEX> such as male hypospadias in
        hand-foot-genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBX</ENAMEX> ) are essential early regulators
        of limb development and also appear to be involved in male
        genital development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Mutations in 
        TBX3 cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ulnar-mammary</ENAMEX> syndrome
        characterized by limb, apocrine, and genital developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>box genes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3</TIMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> was significantly higher in normal male foreskin
        fibroblasts than in AIS genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. 
        BMP4 has been implicated in ductal
        budding and branching during prostate development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        and a potential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP4</ENAMEX> in external genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> has also been postulated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . 
        DWnt2 has been found to have roles in
        sex-specific cell determination in the gonads and genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disc of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Thus, mutations
        in genes characteristically expressed in normal male
        foreskin fibroblasts can, in some cases, lead to defective
        genital development. The data from these experiments
        therefore provide candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for further investigation
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malformations</ENAMEX>.
        As normal genital skin fibroblasts of 46,XY male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> express the AR 
        in vitro (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7</NUMEX> ] ),
        we had anticipated that androgen treatment would elicit a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response program that could provide
        additional insights into the role of androgen in genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. We have previously used a similar approach to
        delineate the transcriptional programs activated in
        prostate cancer cells in response to androgen [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . We
        had hoped that comparison of transcriptional responses of
        normal fibroblasts to those from AIS-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        with varying degrees of genital ambiguity would provide
        still further insights into androgen's role in genital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. However, we were unable to detect any
        significant changes in gene-expression patterns in
        cultured, AR-expressing genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> or in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AIS-</ENAMEX>derived fibroblasts in response to androgens. Although
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous reports have shown increases in aromatase
        enzymatic activity in genital skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dihydrotestosterone</ENAMEX> (DHT) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 27</ENAMEX> ] , others have failed to
        observe changes in aromatase activity in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In agreement with our findings, Elmlinger
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . found significantly different
        baseline expression levels of insulin-like growth factor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF</ENAMEX>) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGFBP</ENAMEX>) between normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AIS-</ENAMEX>derived genital skin
        fibroblasts, and could not detect changes in transcript
        levels in response to androgen treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In normal
        genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, androgen-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes can
        only be activated by expression of co-transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, endogenous AR
        expression itself may be insufficient in genital skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to elicit a transcriptional response. Moreover,
        the lack of detectable changes in transcript levels for any
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the AIS-fibroblasts virtually
        excludes the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHT</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R1881</ENAMEX> could be acting
        through other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid receptors</ENAMEX> or other signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        The differences in androgen responsiveness we have
        observed between normal genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> epithelial cells 
        in vitro might reflect the responses
        seen 
        in vivo . Prostate epithelial cells
        retain exquisite sensitivity to androgen throughout life.
        Androgen deprivation produces profound involution of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>, particularly of the epithelial component, but
        little or no change in the external genitalia. It is
        possible that genital mesenchymal cells are only capable of
        responding to androgen at discrete stages in development in
        their specific 
        in vivo environment. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, stromal
        androgen responsiveness is restricted to the earliest
        stages in prostate development, and later the epithelial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX> becomes responsive and remains so [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This
        responsiveness may be mediated through the expression of
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. Compared to LNCaP cells, normal
        male genital fibroblasts show distinctly lower baseline
        expression of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> (such as NCOA2
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GRIP-1</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NCOA3</TIMEX> (TRAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ARA54</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RNF14</NUMEX>), data not shown).
        Thus, genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> may express critical AR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> at discrete times during development that
        allow them to respond by setting up long-lasting
        transcriptional programs that underlie the genesis and
        maintenance of genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morphology</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data suggest that in addition to
        androgen-independent positional influences on fibroblast
        phenotypes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> is originally involved in establishing
        stable and reproducible patterns of gene expression in
        stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> during genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">differentiation</ENAMEX>, which are
        reflected in the differences in global gene-expression
        patterns between fibroblasts cultured from the genital skin
        of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of the expression patterns of genital
        fibroblasts from 46,XY normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and 46,XY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated AR</ENAMEX> provides a window on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression programs within the urogenital mesenchyme,
        which contribute to the development and structural
        integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genitalia</ENAMEX>. For further
        discrimination of androgen-independent positional effects
        from prenatal androgen actions on expression phenotypes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">genital fibroblast strains</ENAMEX>, comparative expression
        profiling of homologous genital tissues is needed. The
        apparent lack of response of genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to
        androgen 
        in vitro , despite expression of a
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>, has important implications for future research
        in defining the role of androgen in genital development and
        the pathogenesis of ambiguous genitalia. Transcriptional
        profiling of the early stages of genital development 
        in vivo in the presence and absence
        of androgen may provide further insights into the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> in genital development.

          Cell strains
          Primary cultures of genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> were

          Cell culture and hormone treatment
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of basal gene-expression profiles

          cells were scraped and mRNA harvested directly.
          Androgen stimulation of genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> was
          carried out under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different culture conditions
          similar to those previously reported to produce induction
          of aromatase enzymatic activity in these cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, cells were grown to confluence as

          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of experiments, cells were cultured
          to confluence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> as described above. They were

          Microarrays with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 43,000</NUMEX>
          sequence-validated PCR-amplified human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> representing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,968</NUMEX> UniGene clusters were manufactured as described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . Hybridizations were performed using equal amounts
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-labeled cDNAs according to previously
          published protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Hybridized microarrays were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned</ENAMEX> using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GenePix4000</NUMEX> array scanner and analyzed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenePix Pro 3.0</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Microarray data analysis
          Only spots with fluorescence signals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold greater
          than background in either the experimental or reference
          samples were included in the analysis. To correct for
          variations in cDNA labeling efficiency, we normalized the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> fluorescence ratios for all genes in each array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to obtain an average log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. We restricted our
          analysis to genes with measurable expression in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> we analyzed. We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          to identify genes with statistically significant
          differences in baseline expression levels between normal
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX> genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure computes a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>statistic (for example for normal vs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>
          cell lines) for the normalized log ratios of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels for each gene. It thresholds the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-statistics to provide a 'significant' gene list and
          provides an estimate of the false discovery rate (the
          percent of genes identified by chance alone) from
          randomly permuted data. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression data were
          clustered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] and results were visualized using
          TreeView software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          To identify the effects of androgen treatment on gene
          expression in genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, we carried out a set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analyses of mRNA from normal and AIS
          genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. This dataset included cells treated
          at confluence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) or during exponential
          proliferation as described above. Raw data were filtered,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> and centered as described above. We used the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure to identify transcripts with significant
          differences in expression with reference to the origin of
          the fibroblast lines, whether the cells were confluent or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferating</ENAMEX>, and whether they had been treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX>.
