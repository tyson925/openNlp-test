        Certain genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> are known to modify the expression
        of other allelic or non-allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> loci in a
        meiotically heritable fashion. If allelic, such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Mendelian</ENAMEX> interactions are referred to as paramutation.
        In the non-allelic case, the term 'heritable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans-silencing</ENAMEX>' may be used. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramutation</ENAMEX> has been studied
        extensively for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize loci</ENAMEX> that encode transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramutation</ENAMEX> has
        also been investigated in the Arabidopsis 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, at the 
        a1 and chalcone synthase (CHS)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene loci</ENAMEX> in petunia, and in a number of other cases [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BAL/CPR1</ENAMEX> displays a related form of
        epigenetic instability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Interactions resembling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramutation</ENAMEX> also occur among non-allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> loci
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence homology</ENAMEX>. In these cases one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> locus
        tends to suppress the expression of its target locus
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'trans-silencing</NUMEX>') [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramutation</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing are related processes. For example, an
        inverted repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> of the tryptophan biosynthetic gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PAI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WS</ENAMEX> ecotype of
        Arabidopsis silences homologous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX> alleles, as well as unlinked 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI genes</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> ecotype
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Likewise, complex synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgenes</ENAMEX> composed of 
        PAI inverted repeats were able to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-methylate homologous, yet non-allelic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target loci</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . Similar events have been observed in other species
        [e.g. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ].
        Epigenetic activity, defined here as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">heritable trans-</ENAMEX>silencing or paramutation, is not
        predictable from the DNA sequence alone, and its molecular
        basis is incompletely understood. Arguably the most widely
        implicated factor is the presence of complex DNA sequence
        repeats. These repeats are often part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> or paramutagenic locus or its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 14 15 16 17</NUMEX>
        ] . However, the repeat can sometimes be located at a
        considerable distance from the affected locus itself, as
        has recently been shown for the single-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        b1 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Other than
        transcriptional gene silencing, paramutation is only weakly
        correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX>. The methylation status of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        r1 genes and Arabidopsis 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI genes</ENAMEX> is altered upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramutation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19</NUMEX> ] , while that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        b1 is not [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , except, in the
        non-conventional way, in the distal paramutation-control
        region of 
        b1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Conversely, extensive
        exposure of a wild-type Arabidopsis 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUPERMAN</ENAMEX> allele to a heavily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylated</ENAMEX> and transcriptionally silenced epiallele did not
        reveal any trans-silencing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        The stochastic nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene silencing</ENAMEX> has been
        documented on numerous occasions, e.g. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 21</ENAMEX> ] , including
        in one of the initial descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cosuppression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        . However, with specific regards to epigenetically active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene loci</ENAMEX>, it is often not transparent whether their
        silencing behavior was stable over successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>,
        nor when and how individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> acquired their epigenetic
        activity. Certain loci are known to acquire their
        epigenetic activity spontaneously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , suggesting an
        epigenetic control mechanism. For instance, at the 
        b1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific allele can
        switch spontaneously from a non-paramutagenic,
        transcriptionally active, state to a paramutagenic,
        transcriptionally silenced, state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Whether the same
        is true for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing is not well established.
        Whether the imprint imposed by a paramutagenic locus is
        relayed effectively from the first target locus to a
        secondary target locus is a variable characteristic of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramutation</ENAMEX> systems, and this has implications for the
        speed of epiallele conversion within outcrossing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Paramutable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> alleles of 
        b1 and 
        pl1 are highly effective in relaying
        such an imprint [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] (also see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ), whereas other
        loci, although sensitive to imprinting, are less effective
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] or apparently ineffective [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] in relaying the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imprint</ENAMEX> to secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Likewise, Arabidopsis 
        PAI2 and 
        PAI3 genes that have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-methylated by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PAI1/PAI4</ENAMEX> locus do not transfer their
        methylation status to naive singlet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In fact,
        there are few well-documented cases for the non-allelic
        relay of trans-silencing ability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 24</NUMEX> ] . Does this
        amount to an operational difference between allelic
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">paramutation</NUMEX>) and non-allelic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans-silencing</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, or does it simply reflect a lack of data?
        A translational fusion between green fluorescent protein
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arabidopsis Constitutive</ENAMEX> Photomorphogenesis1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COP1</NUMEX>) has been established as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . A
        cauliflower <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mosaic</ENAMEX> virus 35S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> driven 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX>,
        exemplifies an epigenetically active trans-silencer locus.
        C73 contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> copies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> comprising
        the 
        35S:GFP-COP1 gene as well as a
        kanamycin resistance gene driven by the nopaline synthase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> ( 
        nos:nptII ). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX> locus is
        silenced transcriptionally (TGS) but retains partial
        expression of both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nptII</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> remains expressed in the
        seedling root but is largely silenced in the shoot. Other 
        35S:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> loci become
        transcriptionally silenced upon exposure to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX> locus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C73</ENAMEX> is
        conveniently visualized by its negative effect on the
        cop1-like cosuppression phenotype that is associated with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> locus. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'single T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>'
        locus that causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homozygosity-dependent cosuppression</ENAMEX> of
        its 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and of the
        endogenous 
        COP1 gene at the rosette stage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (type L=late silencing), which in turn results
        in a characteristic dwarfing and other aspects of a 
        cop1 -like phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In
        contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX> (type E=early) is an oligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> locus
        that causes homozygosity-dependent 
        COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogene</ENAMEX> silencing at the
        seedling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, in particular deetiolation in dark-grown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seedlings</ENAMEX>. E82 also causes essentially dominant
        cosuppression at the adult stage. Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91 and E82</TIMEX> are
        silenced posttranscriptionally (PTGS) and both are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> for a larger group of loci with similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene silencing characteristics</ENAMEX>. Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> is
        often homozygosity-dependent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTGS loci L91</ENAMEX> or E82 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C73</TIMEX> silencer locus is
        most easily apparent by the loss of the typical 
        cop1- like cosuppressionphenotype
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Similar results were obtained for another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencer locus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C97</TIMEX>.
        The experimental strategy of monitoring heritable
        epialleles via their effect on visible cosuppression
        patterns has been pioneered in the chalcone synthase (CHS)
        family of petunia and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10 30</ENAMEX> ] . For
        comparison, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHS trans</ENAMEX>-silencing offers exquisite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, in part due to the cell autonomy of its
        pigmentation phenotype, whereas 
        COP1 essentially yields a whole-plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Petunia 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHS</ENAMEX> also lends itself to detect
        somatic transitions in epialleles due to its indeterminate
        growth habit, whereas Arabidopsis 
        COP1 is more suitable for monitoring
        early epigenetic activity in seedlings and rosette
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>.
        We have begun to define the determinants of epigenetic
        activity of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencers as
        well as their targets reside in single-copy, gene-rich
        regions that are only sparsely populated with repetitive or
        transposable elements, features that have been shown to
        mediate epigenetic activity in other cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 31 32</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore trans-silencing of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> is probably not mediated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene flanking sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, as with
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> cited above, trans-silencing ability is
        correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> locus structure, given that the
        C73 and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">C97 trans-silencers</NUMEX> contain multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-DNAs</ENAMEX> while
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82 and L91</TIMEX>, are essentially dimeric and
        monomeric, respectively.
        Here we report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C73</ENAMEX> and C97
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencer loci displayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> and trans-silencing after
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> passing through a transitory phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> over the
        course of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. A similar
        epigenetic instability of the initial PTGS phenotype was
        typical for a subset of other oligomeric loci, but was
        never observed with monomeric 
        35S:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>. It is this
        instability of cosuppression that originally prompted us to
        categorize certain loci as type C rather than type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. We</ENAMEX>
        also characterized the heritability of the imprint imposed
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C73</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencer locus with respect to (a)
        cosuppression of the 
        COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogene</ENAMEX> and (b) a
        characteristic yet unusual expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression at the target locus. Finally, our data suggest
        that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L91</TIMEX> target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> acquires limited trans-silencing
        activity of its own after exposure to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX>, which is an
        unusual case for transgenes. However, these data must be
        interpreted in light of another novel observation, namely
        that even relatively simple, transcriptionally active,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene loci</ENAMEX> can interact with nonlinear gene dosage
        effects that have characteristics of epigenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing.
      
      
        Results
        
          The silencing phenotypes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73 and C97</TIMEX> were
          acquired epigenetically
          Many of the most potent epigenetically active loci are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> rather than transgenic and, therefore, their
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early epigenetic</TIMEX> history is not completely known. In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> have a defined date of origin within
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> lineage. In our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>, the
          silencer loci 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1 C73</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C97</ENAMEX> underwent an
          apparently spontaneous transition in their silencing
          behavior between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). In
          detail, the progeny of the primary transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, T1
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C73</ENAMEX>, which possessed a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene locus</ENAMEX> as
          determined by segregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>,
          segregated almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one quarter</NUMEX> cop1-like seedlings in the
          dark-grown <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T2</NUMEX> generation. This dosage dependence of
          endogene silencing was the same as for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTGS locus</ENAMEX> E82
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Unambiguous evidence for a cosuppression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and endogene, as opposed to a dominant negative
          effect of the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, has previously been
          shown for line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L4</NUMEX> and others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> endogene
          suppression was also associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> silencing
          in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T2</NUMEX> generation type C lines (not shown). At the adult
          stage, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX> were visibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosuppressed</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> generation, derived by
          selfing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and known by run-on transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> to be silenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , had few cop1-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seedlings</ENAMEX> and no cop1-like adult <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Similar results
          were obtained for line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C97</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C97</ENAMEX> line is the only line
          in this work that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unlinked loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ,
          which may have contributed to the high incidence of PTGS
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX> seedlings. Neither of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> retained its
          endogene silencing ability in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). No 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cosuppression</ENAMEX> was observed
          beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C73</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C97</NUMEX> (not shown). Two
          additional oligomeric 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C11 and C71</TIMEX>, which
          have not been tested for their trans-silencing behavior,
          also changed from a cosuppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the T2
          generation to a non-cosuppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A). In contrast, none of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) type L loci
          lost their endogene silencing ability (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). The
          apparent increase in adult COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cosuppression</ENAMEX> from the T2
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> of some type L lines was not statistically
          significant. The type E loci <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82 and E83</TIMEX> were also stable
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). Together, these results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> in
          certain oligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA loci</ENAMEX> is unstable and has a
          tendency to progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX>. In line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX>, the transition
          probably began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX> seedlings, as suggested by the small
          fraction of adult T2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">cop1</NUMEX>-like PTGS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transgene</ENAMEX> locus structure of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus
          In order to distinguish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L91 and E82</TIMEX> loci more
          confidently in subsequent experiments, we defined the
          structure of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus in more detail. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L91</NUMEX> locus
          is a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> locus at a defined chromosomal
          location. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> blots probed with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-DNA right border (RB) revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . Early attempts to isolate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E82</TIMEX> flanking
          sequence by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIL-PCR</ENAMEX> repeatedly recovered a fortuitous
          junction between a left border (LB) and a partial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the 
          GFP-COP1 gene. A schematic drawing
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus structure incorporating all of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> as well as data from blots probed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> and 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> (not shown) is
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. This model was subsequently
          confirmed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: an 
          NdeI restriction site predicted
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> blots was confirmed in the flanking
          sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification with specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> across the flanks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and across the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal LB-RB</ENAMEX> junction resulted in the expected product
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, we propose that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus
          consists of a direct repeat, which is joined at the tail
          end by a partial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in an inverted orientation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans</ENAMEX>-silencing by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX> results in variable novel
          transgene expression patterns, including spatial
          expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression
          The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">C73 trans-silencer</NUMEX> locus caused transcriptional
          silencing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target loci</ENAMEX> tested, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91 and E82</TIMEX>, which
          is most easily detected by a suppression of the typical
          endogene cosuppression of the target loci (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          . As expected, the spatial expression pattern of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>'s 
          GFP-COP1 gene was restricted,
          though not completely abolished, upon exposure to C73
          (not shown, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Dbelow). In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">F2 families</ENAMEX>
          segregating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73 and E82</TIMEX> contained many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with an
          expanded spatial pattern of expression, namely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'reactivation'</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression in the cotyledons
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, especially in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trichomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4panels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>, E, H, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). For comparison,
          the naive <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX> alone were silenced in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A,4D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Jand Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F,4Iand 4M</ENAMEX>).
          Such a reactivation had previously been observed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dihybrid C73/E82</ENAMEX> F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The
          reactivated expression was subsequently ascribed to the
          E82 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX>, by testing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2</ENAMEX> segregants
          lacking C73 (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5below</NUMEX>). In summary, silencing of
          L91 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX> was incomplete, as especially E82
          recovered partial transgene expression in organs where it
          was not normally expressed.
          These results underscore the similarity between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans-silencing</ENAMEX> and paramutation, because in both cases
          epialleles are often silenced incompletely and may also
          adopt novel regulatory patterns [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] , for example
          light inducibility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Perhaps, silencing at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> locus involves a hierarchical relationship
          between its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-DNAs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX> locus may
          preferentially target a postulated 'master' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which
          in turn loses its ability to post-transcriptionally
          silence the 'subordinate' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E82</TIMEX> locus.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> loci of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX> maintain their epigenetic
          imprint heritably for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX> generations
          A diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay was developed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L91</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C73</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> to unambiguously identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2</NUMEX> segregants
          containing a trans-silenced L91 or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E82</NUMEX> target locus but
          lacking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C73</TIMEX> silencer locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B; compare lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-4</ENAMEX> with lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-8</ENAMEX>). In addition, hemizygous segregants
          were distinguished from homozygotes by segregation of the
          kanamycin resistance gene in their selfed progeny
          (compare lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-2 with 3-4</ENAMEX>). Subsequently, the rate of
          phenotypic reversion from trans-silencing was observed
          for hemizygous and homozygous lineages of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82 and L91</TIMEX>. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">legend</ENAMEX> for scoring the 
          cop1 -like cosuppression and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> silencing
          patterns is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A. Unless exposed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX>, E82
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> are always 
          cop1 -like and silenced for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX>, and the same is true for homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L91</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
          In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L91</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were
          wild type-like, rather than cosuppressed, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> if
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> had been exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">C73</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5Cand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5D</TIMEX>, previously summarized in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ). Both the
          reactivation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression as
          well as suppression of endogene silencing were maintained
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to four</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> in the absence of
          C73 in hemizygous and homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, while C73
          remained silenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L91</NUMEX> lineage also
          maintained its imprint from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">C73</NUMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Specifically, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">cop1</NUMEX>-like cosuppression
          phenotype typical for homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L91</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> remained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suppressed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5D).
          Although the imprints on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E82 and L91</TIMEX> loci proved
          to be fairly stable, reversion was observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways.
          First, a small fraction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> expected for full
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversion</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cop1</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">E82</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> plants
          appeared in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F4</NUMEX> generation (not reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>);
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX> gradually
          reverted back from the reactivated pattern to the
          silenced pattern especially in hemizygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5C). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression data for the imprinted L91
          lineage were less informative. However, it appears that
          the hemizygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> lineage gradually recovered its 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> expression but without
          reaching the threshold required for posttranscriptional
          cosuppression of the 
          COP1 gene.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imprinting</ENAMEX> relay: Do trans-silenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> and L91
          loci acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing ability?
          Our data suggested that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C73</NUMEX> locus may have
          acquired its trans-silencing activity as part of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epigenetic</ENAMEX> transition from type E to type C silencing
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the T1</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Thus, it is reasonable
          to ask whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing activity be farther
          transferable from the type C locus to other loci. It
          seemed problematic to test whether the trans-silenced L91
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">henceforth</ENAMEX> termed L91') can paramutate a naive L91
          allele, because we cannot distinguish between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L91</NUMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX> at the molecular level.
          Instead, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>' was tested for its effect on a naive E82
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>' was tested against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>, because these loci
          are distinguishable by diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays. Because
          L91' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>' no longer cause 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cosuppression</ENAMEX>, it was easy to
          monitor the interaction by following the cosuppression
          phenotypes of the naive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82 and L91</TIMEX> loci. Figure
          6provides an overview over the crossing scheme, and
          experimental data are presented in Tables 1to 3.
          Significantly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L91</TIMEX>' locus suppressed the 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogene</ENAMEX> silencing by the E82
          target locus in the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F1</ENAMEX> dihybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
          whereas a naive L91 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> did not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Although
          only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were recovered by genotyping in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91 × E82</ENAMEX> control experiment, the entire <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L91</NUMEX> × E82
          family contained a large fraction of silenced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
          larger than with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>, which was compatible with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive interaction</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between L91 and E82</TIMEX> (not shown).
          As expected, at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression, both
          L91'<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-; E82/- and L91/-; E82/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were silenced
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Likewise, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> progeny, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>'
          continued to suppress the endogene silencing by E82
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), which is normally expected to affect
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three quarters of F2</TIMEX> progeny. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, upon
          genotyping of individual F2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> wild type-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> were identified that carried <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only E82</NUMEX> and no L91'
          locus, confirming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX>' can leave a heritable imprint
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional pieces of data
          distinguish the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>' from
          that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73</TIMEX>. First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> clearly contained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants displaying endogene silencing</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case
          tested, this was due, not surprisingly, to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> locus
          that had escaped from L91' and resumed its endogene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silencing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>' is a less effective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencer than C73 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, and more
          surprisingly, even naive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91 and E82</TIMEX> loci, which had
          shown no trans-silencing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F1</TIMEX>, displayed a loss of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> cosuppression phenotype in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Instead of an expected Mendelian ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> 
          cop1 -like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 38%</NUMEX> were
          observed, a significant shortfall. Genotyping of
          individual F2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> revealed a stochastic escape from 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogene</ENAMEX> silencing in plants
          containing both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82 and L91</TIMEX> and including even a single
          E82 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that lacked L91 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Such a loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosuppression</ENAMEX> has not been observed among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> containing just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX> alone (our unpublished data).
          These data suggest an epigenetic modification of E82
          after exposure to a naive L91 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>.
          In contrast to the epigenetic activity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silenced L91', <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>' had no such activity. When E82'
          was combined with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX> both loci cooperated to cause
          endogene silencing, as seen with unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> and L91
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This was unexpected given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>' caused
          little or no endogene cosuppression with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX>' or on its
          own. Cooperative cosuppression between bona fide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imprinted</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>' and a naive L91 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> was again detected
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> progeny (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>' was clearly
          unable to trans-silence a naive L91 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> and in fact
          seemed to lose its imprint when exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L91</NUMEX>; therefore
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were not analyzed further. E82' also did
          not trans-silence a naive E83 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (not shown).
          Taken together, these data allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conclusions.
          First, experiments with naive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91 and E82</TIMEX> demonstrated
          that even relatively simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> loci associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> can display non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive gene</ENAMEX> dosage effects,
          as apparent by heritable suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imprint</ENAMEX> left on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L91</TIMEX> locus by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C73</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencer
          did modify <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>'s epistatic interaction with a non-allelic
          target locus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>, as seen in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F1</NUMEX> generation. However,
          it remains to be determined whether this trans-silencing
          effect is more likely to be heritable when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> is in an
          imprinted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX>') than in the naive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L91</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the imprint on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E82</TIMEX> locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>') was more
          labile than the imprint on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>' and showed no evidence of
          being transferable.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Epigenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">imprints</ENAMEX> affecting the expression of nuclear
        genes differ in the efficiency with which they are relayed
        onto homologous sequences. In the classical case of
        paramutation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        b1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, the imprint is relayed with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> efficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . That is, a paramutated allele is
        turned into a paramutagenic allele. In contrast, to our
        knowledge, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trans-silenced transgene</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        acquire heritable trans-silencing ability suggesting that
        perhaps trans-silencing ability is more difficult to relay
        between non-allelic transgenes than between allelic loci.
        However, the endogenous 
        p1-rr allele of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> did acquire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramutagenicity</ENAMEX> after exposure to a specific 
        P1 -enhancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Against this background we investigated the possible relay
        of an imprint triggered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> C73
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencer locus, asking specifically whether targets
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silenced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C73</TIMEX> locus (a) acquired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing activity, and (b) were able to pass their
        imprint on to a naive target locus in a heritable
        fashion.
        In summary, the imprinted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX>') displayed no
        significant ability to trans-silence a naive L91 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91</TIMEX>' was initially able to trans-silence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E82</TIMEX>, as
        judged by suppression of the endogene cosuppression
        phenotype associated with naive E82; importantly, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmodified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> control locus did not have this ability
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus, we demonstrated aspect (a) of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imprinting</ENAMEX> relay. Moreover, the suppression of silencing at
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus was partially but not fully heritable given
        that some but not all E82 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segregants</ENAMEX> lacking L91' were
        wild-type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Yet, these data fall short of proving
        aspect (b) of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">imprinting</NUMEX> relay because, surprisingly,
        the combination of naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L91</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E82</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> also caused
        non-linear gene dosage effects that could result in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">heritable trans-</ENAMEX>silencing of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E82</NUMEX> locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        instance. Whether L91' might paramutate an allelic L91
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> remains to be tested. The non-linear gene dosage
        effects between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L91 and E82</TIMEX> were surprising to us because
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, similar experiments conducted with 
        35S:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> did not raise the
        suspicion of epigenetically heritable effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        It is informative to compare the epigenetic interactions
        of the 
        35S:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> transgenes with those of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>)genes, the only other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-characterized</ENAMEX> system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Both gene
        sets consist of relatively simple repeat structures and
        singlet loci, which reside in essentially single-copy
        environments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and unpublished
        observations). The first comparison relates to the speed of
        epigenetic change. Here, combining a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C73</NUMEX>)
        with a non-allelic singlet <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">locus</ENAMEX> possessing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sequence
        identity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L91</NUMEX>) resulted in immediate trans-silencing, as
        seen by a reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> expression and block of
        cosuppression, which was stably maintained in the presence
        or absence of the master locus. In contrast, in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, combining the master
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> (WS ecotype 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PAI1/PAI4</ENAMEX> ) with a non-allelic
        singlet target <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">locus</ENAMEX> possessing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sequence identity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 
        PAI2 ) resulted in methylation after
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of heterozygous contact, and methylation
        became more pronounced after another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . Likewise, in the petunia 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHS</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, interaction between
        an epiallele of the direct-repeat locus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CHS41</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        types of target loci, either an unlinked inverted repeat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> or a more naïve allele of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CHS41</TIMEX>, was initially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> and only became suppressive in the second
        generation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> comparison relates to the relay of epigenetic
        activity. In our system, a trans-silenced singlet gene
        (L91') was able to trans-silence a naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homolog</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E82</NUMEX>)
        within a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. In contrast, a trans-methylated
        singlet 
        PAI2 gene did not trans-methylate a
        naive allelic 
        PAI2 gene within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . Additional experimentation may eventually provide an
        answer to the question of what controls the efficiency of
        such epigenetic interactions.
        Cosuppression of the endogenous COP1 gene is a
        consequence of posttranscriptional silencing, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptionally trans</ENAMEX>-silenced loci do not cosuppress
        COP1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In our hands, a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 
        35S:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene loci</ENAMEX> shifted
        from a cosuppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>, to a
        non-cosuppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX>, within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. These loci are therefore referred to as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'complex</ENAMEX>' loci. Note that type L and type E loci did not
        lose their PTGS phenotype (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). This includes the L72
        locus, which has a reduced penetrance of cosuppression that
        may be attributable to its pericentromeric location [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, both trans-silencer loci, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C73 and C97</TIMEX>,
        belong to the 'complex' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, adding weight to the
        proposition that, like paramutagenicity, trans-silencing
        activity is encoded epigenetically. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice versa</ENAMEX>, this
        transition raises the question whether the originally
        strong transcription of the 
        GFP-COP1 genes, or perhaps the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ensuing PTGS</ENAMEX> phase, somehow sets the stage for the
        subsequent trans-silencing activity, especially if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multimeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA loci</ENAMEX> are involved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-silencing are similarly intertwined in other cases,
        for example in the epimutable petunia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHS41 locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> often leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX>, although primarily in
        coding regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> methylation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX>, more easily aligned with transcriptional
        silencing, can be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA mediated</ENAMEX> if suitable double stranded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> versions of the promoter sequence are transcribed,
        either fortuitously or by design [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, there may be a natural tendency for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> loci to
        mature to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> and associated trans-silencing, which in turn
        could prove problematic in applying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> in commercial
        plant breeding programs. Our data are certainly consistent
        with this notion. Such hypotheses are testable with the
        model system we have established.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by structurally
        complex transgenes loci may be unstable and may be
        supplanted by transcriptional gene silencing over the
        course of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Heritable modifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression
        caused by exposure to a trans-silencer locus may be stable
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> or more.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Upon exposure to a trans-silencer locus, certain
        Arabidopsis transgenes display an alteration in their
        epistatic interaction with other transgenes. These data
        suggest that the competence for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>silencing may be
        transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> non-allelic transgenes, reminiscent of
        the allelic transfer of epigenetic activity during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramutation</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Cosuppression phenotypes can serve as sensitive
        indicators of epigenetic interactions between transgenes in
        Arabidopsis thaliana.

          Because trans-silencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E82</ENAMEX> was observed regardless of
