        The aim of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to evaluate the ethnoveterinary
        remedies used by certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> are
        used to treat snakebites and scorpion stings and for
        hunting success. During the research some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> claimed
        that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> either started hunting or hunted better
        after they had treated them in various ways with medicinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. This study has evolved out of an interest in a
        non-experimental evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobago</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnopharmacopoeia</ENAMEX>. This evaluation establishes whether the
        plant use is based on empirically verifiable principles or
        whether symbolic aspects of healing are more important [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hunters</ENAMEX> are principally interested in the following
        game <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>: agouti ( 
        Dasyprocta agouti ), matte ( 
        Tupinambis negropunctatus ), tatou ( 
        Dasypus novemcinctus ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> ( 
        Mazama americana trinitatis ), lappe
        ( 
        Agouti paca ), manicou ( 
        Didelphis marsupialis insularis ),
        wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX>/quenk ( 
        Tayassu tajacu ). The hunting season
        lasts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1st</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 28/29</TIMEX>, then there is a
        closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX>. There is no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> published information available on the number
        of hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are typically
        foxhounds, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 inch and 9 inch beagles</NUMEX>, coonhounds (all
        original stock imported) and mixed breeds. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are
        usually scent and not sight hounds.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          The research area is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guayaguayare</ENAMEX> on
          private land belonging to a State-owned oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. This
          area also has a protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> reserve where in theory
          no hunting is allowed. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1997 - 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          conducted research with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> based
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south Trinidad</ENAMEX> on this private land (not in the
          protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> reserve). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> was
          Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trinidadian</ENAMEX>, the others were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afro-Trinidadian</ENAMEX> or of
          mixed race. This research included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>
          observation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , which involved taking part in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          hunts over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three years</TIMEX> (going into the forest,
          observing the chase and capture, sharing a meal and
          sharing of take home game). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> veterinarian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1served</TIMEX> as
          the linkage and provided entrance to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
          facilitated the participation in the hunting activities.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunts</ENAMEX> started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after this veterinarian
          arrived with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and either one or both of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterinarians</ENAMEX>, typically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 9 a.m</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 a.m.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunts</ENAMEX> ended when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> agouti was caught.
          The earliest occasion being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.00</NUMEX> hrs. After the return
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, cooking would take place. Stories would
          continue until <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.00</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.00</NUMEX> hrs. The ethnoveterinary
          remedies were written up into a handout. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          joined in two social occasions in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> in
          turn sat with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and added details to
          information already documented in the handout and
          confirmed his remedies. These social occasions lasted
          from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11.00 a.m.</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.00</NUMEX> hrs.
          Unstructured interviews were also held with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Trinidad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramin</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Trinidad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talparo</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mayaro</ENAMEX> (South
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>). The interviews were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> long in Paramin
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayaro</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three eight hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> were spent talking to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talparo</ENAMEX> informants while they worked on a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talparo</ENAMEX> retain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
          traditions either from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> or
          from continuous small-scale immigration from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . Many of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> intermarried
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>'s original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amerinidian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mayaro</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afro-Trinidadians</ENAMEX> the
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were of mixed race. The following information
          was collected from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, the popular name,
          uses, part(s) used, mode of preparation and application.
          The ethnoveterinary handout was given to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> then used the documented information to
          provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> provided the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> that he used to bathe <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quenk</ENAMEX> hunting. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">author</ENAMEX> collected the other <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40% percent</NUMEX> of the documented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> from the informants in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mayaro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talparo</ENAMEX> and
          Paramin, and on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion when the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> was
          being dismantled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> for the closed
          season. The use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> was only reported, not
          observed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> bath was shown already prepared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayaro</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were identified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies Herbarium</ENAMEX>, but no voucher specimens
          were deposited.

          Environmental hazards
          The following section outlines environmental hazards
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>) which may explain some of
          their bush medicine remedies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> research hazard was the
          presence of a mite infestation 
          Trombicula <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, in the area.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mites</ENAMEX> are called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">'bête rouge</ENAMEX>' locally because of
          the orange colour of the larval cluster seen on the skin.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mites affect game animals</ENAMEX> like agouti and can attack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> since they attach themselves to all mammals and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> can confirm that depending on the
          sensitivity of the individual a larval infection produces
          slight or extreme irritation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesions</ENAMEX> may persist after
          the larvae have left to begin their adult stage however
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dermatitis</ENAMEX> disappears. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult mites</ENAMEX> are free
          living on vegetation and are found in fruit- growing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> on chalky soil [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX> fever outbreaks in the past have affected
          howler <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> ( 
          Alouatte seniculus insularis ) and
          can spread to any mammals, since these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> are
          susceptible to sylvan forms of the human disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          Another occupational and research hazard is the presence
          of constricting and venomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>. 'Belle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemin'</ENAMEX> ( 
          Liophis melanotus nesos ) is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constrictor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'huile'</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Boa murina</ENAMEX> ) eats all vertebrates.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">venomous snakes</ENAMEX>. Within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elapidae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> poisonous coral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snakes</ENAMEX> ( 
          Micrurus lemniscatus , 
          Micrurus circinalis ) which rarely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bite dogs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> since they are small, rare, and have
          retracted fangs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . 
          Micrurus venom has moderate effects
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood coagulation</ENAMEX> and tissue integrity however victims
          rarely survive because the potent neurotoxin in the venom
          causes a postsynaptic blockade of neuromuscular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The neurotoxin can cause cranial
          nerve paralysis leading to neurotoxic facies or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> paralysis and death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Some harmless <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colubridae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> like 
          Leptodeira annulata ashmeadi , 
          Leptophis ahaetulla
          coeruleodorsus , 
          Clelia clelia clelia , 
          Helicops angulatus , 
          Liophis <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          Oxybelis aeneus , 
          Pseudoboa neuwiedii , 
          Thamnodynastes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and 
          Tripanurgos compressus , 
          Erythrolamprus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          Siphlophis cervinus , 
          Oxyrhopus petola petola , may bite
          and cause a reaction or mild envenomation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
          last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are called false corals since they mimic true
          coral <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> for protection. Bites from false corals are
          more common than those of true corals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Snakes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viperidae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are locally called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'mapepire'</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit vipers</ENAMEX> have long, hollow fangs. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mapepire 'z'ananna</ENAMEX>' or 'bushmaster' ( 
          Lachesis muta muta ) and 'mapepire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">balsain</ENAMEX>' or 'fer-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-lance</ENAMEX>' ( 
          Bothrops atrox atrox ) are large
          and poisonous. 
          Lachesis muta can inject a large
          dose of venom in a single bite [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> have
          front fangs and bitten areas show severe swelling and
          necrosis of tissue due to haemorrhagic, myotoxic,
          necrotizing, defibrinogenating, coagulant, caseinolytic,
          proteolytic, oedema-inducing, coagulant and neurotoxic
          venom activities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          Hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> may be stung by scorpions of the Buthidae
          family ( 
          Tityus trinitatis ). The effects of
          the sting can be severe. 
          Tityus trinitatis accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          of the scorpion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other
          species which are all venomous [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Signs would be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swelling</ENAMEX>, pain and limping in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. There are
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">175</TIMEX> stings by 
          Tityus trinitatis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> human
          deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> acute symptoms are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convulsions</ENAMEX>, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, sweating,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyspnoea</ENAMEX> and localised burning [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Of all scorpion
          sting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> developed acute pancreatitis and in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of these cases there was no abdominal pain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Conventional treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> for snakebites and
          scorpion stings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> makes use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> and the ananase enzyme (from the pineapple 
          Ananas comosus ) and needs to take
          place within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> of the bite. Conventional treatment
          would include analgesics and antiinflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          ] . The snake bite site typically is a necrotic area, the
          skin sloughs off due to the proteases in the venom and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> looks dark and bruised [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The ananase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> reduces the inflammatory response; and helps the
          breakdown of necrotic tissue. It is felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> bitten
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> have a better chance of survival since there
          is less vascular absorption of the venom.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hunters</ENAMEX>' ethnoveterinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are used in an attempt to improve
          hunting success. For this purpose the odour and other
          physical characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> are very important.
          Plant use for hunting success has been divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          categories. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is called "steaming" and these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> are usually administered in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> and are
          considered mental and/or physical stimulants. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steaming</ENAMEX> is
          also carried out with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of insect (an unidentified
          solitary wasp that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hunts spiders</ENAMEX>). Both the wasp and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spider prey</ENAMEX> are put into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pepper</ENAMEX> ( 
          Aframomum melegueta ) on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
          This solution is then given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, or included in
          the bath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and it was claimed to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stimulant</ENAMEX>
          effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> category comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> placed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s nose. Here it is expected that this action will act
          as a nasal and chest decongestant and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> will
          subsequently have a better sense of smell and improve its
          ability to follow a scent.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> category is based partly on the Doctrine of
          Signatures in which a plant characteristic is considered
          to have a desirable quality or to have a physical
          property that resembles the desired game. This desirable
          quality is claimed to be transferred to the dog after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> is used in a bath. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used in this category
          are also chosen in recognition of animal behaviour. For
          example one respondent claimed that after the hole of an
          agouti was dug out 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> marginatum was found in the
          hole and it was claimed that it was being used as a bed.
          Therefore hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> bathed with this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> would
          recognise the smell of the agouti, which would carry
          traces of the strong smell of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> marginatum .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> category is called "cross". In this
          situation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> complain that the dog goes in the
          opposite direction from the game. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is faced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and bathed in a river and rubbed with the
          crushed leaves of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (sometimes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used have no other distinguishing characteristic).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is then turned to face downstream. One respondent
          claimed that when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are "crossed" and seem to be
          "climbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>" they are really chasing spirits in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> who hunts quenks claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are
          trained to hunt small game <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. For example the dog is
          bathed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">congo lala</ENAMEX> ( 
          Eclipta prostrata ) and it will
          start hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matte</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tupinambis negropunctatus ), then
          it is bathed with caraaili leaf ( 
          Momordica charantia ) and barbadine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leaf</ENAMEX> ( 
          Passiflora quadrangularis ) so that
          it will hunt larger game. Eventually the dog is bathed
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> for quenks.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> are also used for emergencies such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snakebites</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used for snakebites are typically made
          into tinctures with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>) and
          kept in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> ml flasks called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'snake</ENAMEX> bottles'. Snakes
          bottles contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and/ or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. These
          tinctures are also used against scorpion stings ( 
          Tityus trinitatis ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snake medicines</ENAMEX> are often collected during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Lent</ENAMEX> or
          specifically on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday</ENAMEX>. In normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> this period
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dry</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and the concentration of
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> may differ from other times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tref</ENAMEX> ( 
          Aristolochia trilobata ) has to be
          rewarded with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> coins as a symbolic payment before
          removing some of its parts, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> claim that
          the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> or clump of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> will die. This
          payment was supposed to be placed in the hole from which
          the root was dug. The only explanation given for the
          payment was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was not a "simple plant".
          Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have one local name for several
          closely related species. For example <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Candlestick</ENAMEX> is the
          name of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> hispidum , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> marginatum (species
          collected), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> amalgo and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> dilatatum . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Monkey</ENAMEX> step
          refers to either 
          Bauhinia exisa or the more commonly
          found 
          Bauhinia cumanensis . All closely
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will be dealt with in the ethnomedicinal
          literature review.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used to influence success in hunting are
          presented below in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used for
          snakebites, mange and other skin conditions, and injuries
          are listed below the tables. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1and</ENAMEX> 2to be put
          here.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used for snakebites
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are bitten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, the injury is usually on
          the nostrils, forehead or front shoulder. For snakebites
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> a piece of the woody flexible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vine</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey ladder</ENAMEX> ( 
          Bauhinia cumanensis or 
          Bauhinia excisa , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabaceae</ENAMEX>) is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pounded</ENAMEX> and put on the bite. It is claimed that this
          stops the flesh around the bitten area from dropping off.
          Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>
          and kept in a snake bottle. Tinctures are also made with
          single or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> and plant parts. A typical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tincture</ENAMEX> would contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> root ( 
          Aristolochia rugosa ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw (
          
          Pithocellobium unguis-cati ),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> ( 
          Nicotiana tabacum ), snake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> ( 
          Barleria lupulina ), obie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cola nitida</ENAMEX> ), and wild gri gri
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">root</ENAMEX> ( 
          Acrocomia ierensis , tentative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>).
          Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars ( 
          Battus polydamus , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papilionidae</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] that eat tref leaves ( 
          Aristolochia trilobata ). The leaf
          juice of 
          Eclipta prostrata is used for
          scorpion stings. Emergency snake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> are obtained
          by chewing a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-inch</NUMEX> piece of the root of bois canôt (
          
          Cecropia peltata ) taken from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and administering this chewed-root
          solution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. Alternatively <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mardi gras</ENAMEX> ( 
          Renealmia alpinia ), are crushed
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX> ( 
          Costus scaber ) and the dog is
          given <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two spoonfuls</NUMEX> of the resulting solution. All the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> claimed that their snake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> were
          effective against bites/stings of mapepire. One
          respondent who used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mardi gras</ENAMEX> ( 
          Renealmia alpinia ) for his dog
          claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s throat became swollen after the
          snake bite. After he gave the dog the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> it stood
          up and it was completely recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hours later</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used for mange and other skin
          conditions
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> stem of wild caraaili ( 
          Momordica charantia ) are crushed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and used to bathe <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with mange. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulp</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of the cannonball <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> ( 
          Couroupita guianensis ) is rubbed
          on the infected skin of mangy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. A frothy solution is
          obtained by crushing the leaves of syrio ( 
          Sambucus simpsonii ) in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This
          is used to rub <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with mange. It is claimed that when
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> licks its skin, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> will also work
          internally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dogs</ENAMEX> with rashes are bathed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> ( 
          Justicia secunda , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acanthaceae</ENAMEX>). It
          is claimed that this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> imparts a red colour to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bath water</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used for injuries
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dogs</ENAMEX> may get trauma damage during the hunt but may
          have insufficient contact with game <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to pick up
          any diseases directly from them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mardi gras</ENAMEX> ( 
          Renealmia alpinia ) is used to
          bathe <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> who have strained a limb. Leaves of physic nut
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Jatropha curcas/gossypifolia</ENAMEX> ) are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boiled</ENAMEX> and the decoction used to clean sores. Other
          injuries that hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are susceptible to would be
          nail breakage, lameness and shoulder injuries, injuries
          caused by running into an object or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> may be kicked
          by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dosages
          Dosages were imprecise but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> claimed to know
          what would happen with some cases of overdosing. For
          example an overdose of ruckshun ( 
          Vernonia scorpioides ) would
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-excite the dog to the point where it would even bark
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is given a tincture made with
          puncheon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> proof), it is claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> may
          become temporarily crazy. Based on experiences like
          these, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> have switched from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> to olive
          oil for their tincture solution. Additionally alcohol
          tends to evaporate. Lipophilic compounds are not
          extracted in alcohol that would be extracted by olive
          oil.
          One respondent claimed that pot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Ottonia ovata</ENAMEX> ) gave his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headache</ENAMEX> (it shook its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> continuously and there is no
          sign of anything in its ear), and it made two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX>'s tongues numb. This respondent then put
          Vicks™ in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s nose as an alternative. Another used
          vinegar as an alternative to the 'scratchy' pot. Another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX> claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> had a stronger constitution
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and should be given the equivalent of twice
          the human dose per body weight.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Amerindian conceptualisations of nature
          The following section attempts to reframe the
          ethnomedicinal data in terms of bioscientific concepts
          and methods; or to establish whether symbolic aspects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">healing</ENAMEX> (social support, belief systems) are of greater
          relevance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 14</ENAMEX> ] . The symbolic aspects of the plant
          use are very similar to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindians</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> may be unknowingly using
          the traditions of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amerindian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobago</ENAMEX>. These Amerindian traditions are
          related to those previously practiced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>.
          For example the claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that are "crossed" are
          chasing spirits in the forest rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX> may be
          related to the belief of theTacana in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malevolent</ENAMEX> spirits dwell in canopy <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> such as 
          Dipteryx odorata and 
          Ceiba samauma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The Caribs
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominica</ENAMEX> used leaf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> against bad luck [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venezuelan</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> tradition comes
          the belief in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> called "turals" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> and in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spanish-speaking Trinidad</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> bring good
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortune</ENAMEX> and have silver coins planted at their roots [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> can bring luck may explain
          their use for hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. These beliefs may have
          originated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> are a frequent way
          to utilise traditional remedies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Absorption
          routes of active compounds are the respiratory tract
          (volatile substances carried by water vapour) and the
          skin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . It is also practical to use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> if the
          intention is to disguise the smell of the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> so
          that the game animal does not recognise it [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          The use of hallucinogenic and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> to improve
          hunting success is documented in the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 16</NUMEX> ]
          . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waorani</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ecuadorian Amazon</ENAMEX> feel that the
          characteristics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> or object may pass to
          another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . These beliefs may lie behind the use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> for hunting success. Various rituals were
          performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guyana</ENAMEX> before a hunt [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          ] . These rituals included <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'beenas'</ENAMEX>, which
          acted as charms to entice any object or desire wanted,
          including making the capture of game certain. Each beena
          usually had a specific purpose. Beenas were used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, which were made to swallow specific pieces of roots
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> for specific game <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          Beenas were used because there was an ancient almost
          forgotten belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> possessed associated spirits
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> use of the Guyanese
          Amerindians, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> were made to bite the
          nostrils of the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and other plant
          parts including peppers were then rubbed into the wounds
          on the noses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This was done on the
          assumption that the power of scent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> was improved
          by these practices since the nasal mucous membranes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleaned</ENAMEX>, the perceptions were sharpened, and the dog
          would keep its nose to the ground when hunting [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ]
          . There seemed to be a mental connection of success in
          acquisition of game with pain previously inflicted on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hunter</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The nervous system of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> was irritated to such an extent that it was
          responsive to even the slightest external stimulus and
          therefore more likely to be successful in hunting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          . There was also the belief that inflicting pain was a
          means of preparing to meet without flinching any pain or
          danger that could arise during the chase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This
          preparation was not ill-advised since 
          Lachesis muta muta often lives in
          the burrows of lappe and tatou [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Each hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>
          was trained to hunt one sort of game [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          The use of the solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wasp</ENAMEX> in the "steaming" process
          can also be linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> traditions. Firstly, the
          Amazonian belief that the characteristics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> entity
          or object may pass to another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , could explain the
          use of a wasp that hunts successfully in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decoctions</ENAMEX> to make dogs better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>. Additionally
          there are records of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> that was given to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guyanese Amerindians</ENAMEX> in order to make them good
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindians</ENAMEX> also named their hunting

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ginet</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominica</ENAMEX>, while 
          Aframomum melegueta is called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pepper</ENAMEX> in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. It is not known
          if the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amerindian</ENAMEX> practice was for both plants
          to be used for hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> are given symbolic payments if they are
          considered to have supernatural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> who require such
          payment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The payment is placed on the ground near
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> before it is picked and can be recovered later
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who picked it [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Much of the plant
          use is based on the Doctrine of Signatures which claims
          that plant morphology suggests the medicinal use for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> from various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species of</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristolochia</ENAMEX> to treat snakebites [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 21</NUMEX> ] . The triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a 
          Bothrops <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">viper</ENAMEX> is similar in size
          and shape to many 
          Aristolochia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> leaves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
          . The serpentine coloration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of the 
          Aristolochia vines also suggests
          the use as tourniquets to prevent the spread of snake
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venom</ENAMEX> and the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-snakebite</ENAMEX> potions
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The Doctrine of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signatures</ENAMEX> is also seen in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used as "beenas" or "turals" which are supposed to
          have patterns on their leaves resembling different forest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The beena for lappe had typical white
          markings similar to those of the lappe, while the beena
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quenk</ENAMEX> had a leaf with a small secondary leaf under
          the surface that resembled either the scent gland of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quenk</ENAMEX> or its nostril tip [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are
          collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday in Almería</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Hunting success
          The characteristics that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> need for hunting success
          are scent-accuracy, speed, enthusiasm and stamina.
          However, several of the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> observed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> were in poor condition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicinal</ENAMEX> properties in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> may help alleviate any
          subclinical infections these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> might have due to their
          poor condition.

          hunts they were observed to be running within particular
          territories when chased but had a habit of running and
          doubling back or crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to disguise their scent.
          Dogs pursuing this game have to have their wits about
          them, be fit, and be persistent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> chose
          smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> as "agouti <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>" so that they could follow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agoutis</ENAMEX> through dense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> to their hiding places. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hunters</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> ran straight for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> until
          they lost their pursuers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> were reported to
          spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> searching for their lost <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer dogs</ENAMEX> were
          chosen for endurance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer</ENAMEX> are also solitary and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnal</ENAMEX> and enter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> when chased [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . They are
          also adapted to swampy areas and are good at camouflage [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . All these characteristics are considered by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> when choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer dogs</ENAMEX>. Lappe, tatou and manicou
          are nocturnal, living in hollow fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> during the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> and they forage at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dogs</ENAMEX> pursing this
          game would ideally have good night vision, a good sense
          of smell and cannot be afraid to dive into hollow logs or
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, since lappe often enter their burrows from
          under <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Lappe have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> longitudinal rows of
          white spots [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hunters</ENAMEX> claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used to
          bathe <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> so that they will hunt lappe have similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hunters</ENAMEX> also claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> hunting tatou
          may have to dig to unearth their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX>.
          Wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX>/quenk can be very aggressive, especially in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . They live in swampy parts of
          the forest and will cross <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          The bristles on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-dorsal</TIMEX> line from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> to rump of
          the quenk raise when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is excited and the musk
          glands emit a musky odour [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Quenks</ENAMEX> eat succulent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubers</ENAMEX> and fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and nuts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The bravery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> need to hunt quenk has been documented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Of
          an original pack of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> 'native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curs</ENAMEX>' trained in quenk
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lappe</ENAMEX> hunting, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> received deep flesh wounds
          inflicted by the tusks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quenks during a hunt. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          others were bitten by a 
          Lachesis muta muta that one dog
          pulled out of a hollow tree [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the bitten
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> ran off before they could be treated and died within
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> bitten by 'his
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snakeship'</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7 ft, 10 ins</ENAMEX>) on the neck and paw were held

          carried home and recovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> did
          not indicate if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> uninjured <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> were
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'bravest'</ENAMEX>, 'least brave' or the most 'alert', 'agile'
          or 'lucky'.
        
        
          Olfactory considerations
          There is literature establishing that native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Amerindians</ENAMEX> participated in hunts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . This may explain not only the symbolic aspects of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> use by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> discussed above but also
          the olfactory considerations discussed in this section.
          Both sections show parallels between the practices of
          current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> and the indigenous knowledge of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native South American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mixe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> consider that the odour and taste
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> are important criteria in deciding what plants
          to use for an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waorani</ENAMEX> in Amazonian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with strong, or repulsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">odours</ENAMEX> will force symptoms to flee from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and this
          belief guides their use of 
          Renealmia alpinia and a 
          Philodendron for snakebites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warao</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> consider 'bad air' to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenic</ENAMEX> and 'good' or perfumed air to be therapeutic [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] .
          The acute sense of smell in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> is due to a large
          area of olfactory epithelium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Smells have the
          advantage of remaining in the environment for a long time
          and are a useful means of communication in dense
          vegetation where verbal and visual communication is
          impaired. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> bathe <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with strongly smelling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Piper species</ENAMEX> they may be imitating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal behaviour</ENAMEX> or trying to mask the individual body
          odour of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> so that they remain un-detected by
          game <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dogs</ENAMEX> show a form of behaviour called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rolling/rubbing</ENAMEX> in strongly smelling objects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The
          intention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> may be to eliminate or dilute the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">odour</ENAMEX> since this type of rolling is frequently associated
          with sneezing and running [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In other cases the dog
          may roll in an odour that is considered unpleasant by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plausible explanations for this
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last behaviour</TIMEX>. One is that the dog is attempting to take
          on the odour like a perfume, the other is that the odour
          is too strong to cover with a urine mark so the dog tries
          to cover it with its entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          There are indications that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> Amerindians
          were aware of animal behaviour in relation to smells. For
          example, the bristles on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-dorsal</TIMEX> line from crown
          to rump of the quenk elevate when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is excited
          and the musk glands emit a musky odour [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Quenks
          maintain odour homogeneity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX>. Each animal
          rubs the lower portion of its jaw on a gland in the
          other's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-dorsum</TIMEX>. If a veterinarian removes a quenk
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> for treatment, it will be killed when it is
          replaced, since it will no longer have this herd odour
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Clinical Sciences</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of the West Indies</ENAMEX>, pers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comm</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). If
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hunters bathe dogs</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quenks</ENAMEX> eat the
          temporary smell <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> obtain from this bath may be similar
          to the smell of a quenk that feeds on this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roucouyennes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribs</ENAMEX>) rubbed their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with 
          Hibiscus abelmoschus with the
          expectation that its pungent smell would prevent jaguars
          from biting their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tukanoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> also believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> had an inoffensive body
          odour that was linked to their diet of "pure" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> such
          as fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprouts</ENAMEX>, young green leaves and sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tukanoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> also believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have smells related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that they eat and
          the environment that they lived in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of animal smells with their environment is
          perhaps what the informant was referring to in his
          reference to an agouti and the smell of its 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> marginatum "bed". There is
          evidence that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> are
          eaten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and possibly by other game <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (these
          are 
          Costus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          Eschweilera <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Piper species</ENAMEX> and 
          Pithecellobium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tukanoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> also recognise the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> pheromonal
          system of chemical communication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> use. For example they claimed that when
          white-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> are frightened suddenly from close by,
          they run off and repeatedly break wind. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>
          interpret this behaviour as an attempt to mask the odour
          trail left by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>'s interdigital glands and thus
          mislead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX> and hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Poisons</ENAMEX>
          Caterpillars may accumulate chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that they feed on, which may explain their
          usefulness as part of a remedy. Some hairy caterpillars
          have urticating hairs, which can cause severe skin
          reactions and pain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . It is not known what effect if
          any the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caterpillar venom</ENAMEX> has on the snake bit remedy.
          Any effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> claimed to be efficacious
          against scorpion stings may be due to symptomatic relief
          - analgesic, antiinflammatory, antipruritic effects, in
          addition to other biological activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          While proteases, phospholipase A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and nucleotidases are responsible
          for the haemorrhagic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions induced</ENAMEX> by 
          Bothrops jararaca venom, most
          crotalid myotoxins are phospholipases and some exhibit
          proteolytic activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Crotalid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> have a
          wide geographical distribution, this may contribute to
          differences in their venom composition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          Differences in venom composition may play a role in the
          effectiveness of the medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snakebites</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately no research on the venoms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> was discovered so the following review
          is of the closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> and scorpions. Phospholipase A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was purified from 
          Lachesis muta venom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venom</ENAMEX> also showed procoagulant and proteolytic activities
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . High proteolytic activity was found in venom of 
          Lachesis muta and no platelet
          pro-aggregating activity, low inhibitory effect on
          platelet aggregation and low procoagulant, proteolytic
          and phospholipase activity for 
          Botrops atrox in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> detail the pain and oedema at
          the bite site and manifestations of autonomic nervous
          system stimulation (vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating,
          hypersalivation, bradycardia) that may be attributed to
          serine protease in 
          Lachesis muta venom which causes
          hypotension by releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinins</ENAMEX> from plasma kininogen [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          ] . There are also cases of bleeding distant from the
          bite site such as gingival haemorrhage, epistaxis,
          haemoptysis, haematuria, uterine bleeding, soft tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haematomas</ENAMEX> and very infrequently intrathoracic or
          intrabdominal bleeding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Complications in the
          bitten limb can include secondary infections by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> among
          others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . There is a bothrojacarin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like 27</NUMEX> kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in 
          Bothrops <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species venom</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bothrojacarin</ENAMEX> forms a non-covalent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with thrombin,
          blocking its ability to induce platelet aggregation and
          fibrinogen clotting [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 36</ENAMEX> ] . Haemostatic effects in 
          Lachesis muta venom are
          attributable to an alpha-fibrin(ogen)ase and haemorrhagic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LHF-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LHF-II</ENAMEX>) which have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-fibrin</ENAMEX>(ogen)ase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          The severity of envenoming depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
          length of the snake, the toxicity of the venom and the
          amount inoculated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Also important are physical
          activity after the bite and the physical characteristics
          of the victim [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The severity of bites from 
          Bothrops laceolatus in Martinique
          is increased due to the primary bacterial infection from
          bacteria present in the oral cavity of the snake ( 
          Aeromonas hydrophila , 
          Morganella morganii , 
          Proteus vulgaris and 
          Clostridium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . This
          means that antibiotic treatment is sometimes necessary [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] .
          Scorpion venom when injected exerts a strong
          inflammatory response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Many plant species used
          against stings contain compounds with antiinflammatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, flavonoids (rutin, hesperidin, quercetin),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coumarins</ENAMEX> (bergapten), coumestans (wedelolactone),
          triterpenes, sterols and saponins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 11</NUMEX> ] . The
          mechanism of action of the flavonoids is based on the
          inhibition of enzymatic steps in the arachidonic acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cascade</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> that are
          immunostimulants at very low doses are some alkaloids,
          quinones, isobutylamides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenolcarboxylic acid</ENAMEX> esters
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terpenoids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> compounds with
          immunostimulatory effects are sesquiterpene lactones [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          ] . Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polysaccharides</ENAMEX> and glycoproteins enhance the
          unspecific immune system by activating the phagocytotic
          activity of granulocytes and macrophages, or by inducing
          cytokine production or influencing complement factors [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] .
          Some compounds from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> used for general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> also inhibit enzymes (like phospholipase A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) from snake and scorpion venom [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 42</NUMEX> ] . Some of these plant compounds are
          hypolaetin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-glucoside and related flavanoids.
          Stimulation of the immune system might also contribute to
          reducing the effects of snakebites and improvement in
          recovery from envemomization by contributing to a more
          rapid removal of the venom [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Chlorogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> acts
          as an antidote by binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> through hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and hydrogen bonds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . It presents
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anticomplementary</ENAMEX> action at the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
          . Analgesic properties like those provided by tropane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alkaloids</ENAMEX> would also lessen the pain of the bite, as
          would compounds that act as sedatives and tranquilisers [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] .
          Several pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> reputed
          to be snakebite antidotes include antimyotoxic,
          antihaemorrhagic, analgesic, and antiedematogenic,
          blockage of cutaneous and intraperitoneal capillary
          permeability activity caused by the venom and protection
          from its lethality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . A more direct anti-venom
          activity would involve complexation of the compounds with
          venom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> thus rendering them unable to act on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>; or to act by competitive blocking of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Phenolic compounds especially complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polyphenols</ENAMEX> like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tannins</ENAMEX> can bind with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          ] . Alternatively, the catecholamines released as a
          result of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">venom-receptor interaction</ENAMEX> may be antagonised
          or metabolised more quickly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> ( 
          Mucuna pruriens var. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilis</ENAMEX>) that
          produce a dose-related increase in the clotting time of
          blood induced by carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">viper venom</ENAMEX> ( 
          Echis carinatus ) would be useful
          against bites from 
          Bothrops <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that cause
          haemorrhage at the point of injection due to the
          inhibition of the clotting mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Antivenom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> so far isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> include
          protocatechuic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">catechin-gallo-catechin</ENAMEX> tannin,
          caffeic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid derivatives</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorogenic acid</ENAMEX>, cynarin),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coumarins</ENAMEX> (bergapten), flavonoids (rutin,
          isoscutellarein, kaempferol, quercetin, hesperidin),
          ar-turmerone, alkaloids (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aristolochic acid</ENAMEX>),
          triterpenoids, triterpenes, coumestans (wedelolactone),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sterols</ENAMEX> (sitosterol, stigmasterol, beta-amyrin),
          triterpenoid glycosides, alkaloids (allantoin) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lignoflavonoids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 40 44 42</NUMEX> ] . Many relevant compounds
          are widely distributed nitrogen-free, low molecular
          weight compounds (except <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aristolochic acid</ENAMEX>, an untypical
          non-basic, nitro-derivative) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The structural
          similarities of certain plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> found in plants
          used for snakebites are an isoflavone skeleton, acidic
          nature and dioxygenated functionality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study found total inhibition of 
          Bothrops asper haemorrhage with the
          ethanolic, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of plants
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catequines</ENAMEX>, flavones, anthocyanines and
          condensated tannins. These compounds may have played a
          role in the inhibitory effect observed, probably owing to
          the chelation of the zinc required for the catalytic
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">venom</ENAMEX>'s haemorrhagic metalloproteinases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          ] . Reduction in the intensity of the effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">envenomation</ENAMEX> could also be achieved by a neutralisation
          of the venom peptides, polypeptides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and enzymes
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 11</NUMEX> ] . There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used for snakebite that act
          by inhibiting the proteolytic activities of the venom and
          antagonising crotoxin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haemolysis</ENAMEX>, myotoxic and
          haemorrhagic activities of crotalid venoms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
          
          Tityus trinitatis toxic fraction
          was recognised by the antiserum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venezuelan</ENAMEX>
          scorpion 
          Tityus discrepans (which has a
          β-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . The onset of symptoms from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of evenomation is generally <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between five and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Local evidence of a sting is often minimal or
          absent but several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> report severe pain or a
          burning sensation with intense pruritis and local or
          general hyperesthesia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Symptoms may last from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>. Redness, inflammation and
          local oedema at the sting site are evident [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> the following clinical features have been
          seen: tachypnea, restlessness, vomiting, increased
          salivation, cerebral oedema, pulmonary oedema,
          hypovolemic shock and convulsions, with myocarditis and
          pancreatitis being major complications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Scorpion
          venoms may cause these symptoms through release of
          catecholamines from the sympathetic nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          . The venom exerts its effects primarily to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX> and respiratory systems, but there is also
          stimulation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic
          peripheral activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The venom is a complex
          mixture of phospholipase A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , low molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,

          Review of the known biological effects of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>
          This section reviews available literature on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> identified in this study and compares their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobago</ENAMEX> ethnoveterinary use to the
          folk-medicinal use in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> (mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>-medicinal uses are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> uses unless otherwise specified. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> used to
          achieve hunting success including those chosen according
          to the Doctrine of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signatures</ENAMEX> will be treated here as
          medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> since supernatural emic can occasionally
          suggest etic efficacy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or genus
          a summary of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> will be given, in
          addition to active compounds if known. This type of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnopharmacological</ENAMEX> review and evaluation is documented
          in the literature [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> below are listed in

          Acrocomia ierensis (tentative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>).
          No research was found on the compounds in the root.
          
          Aframomum melegueta has been
          previously recorded as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stimulant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Caribs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominica</ENAMEX> used 
          Aframomum granum-paradisi leaves on
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> while they were bathing and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was
          also given to their hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Seeds</ENAMEX> were put
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> as a 'chauffe' to excite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . 
          Aframomum granum-paradisi contains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alkaloids</ENAMEX> (piperine), essential oils and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
          .
          
          Aristolochia rugosa and 
          Aristolochia trilobata are recorded
          in a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> used worldwide and in the West
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snakebites</ENAMEX> and scorpion stings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 24 43 40 53</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala</ENAMEX> use 
          Aristolochia trilobata root and
          tuber decoctions for stomach pains and use leaf tinctures
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diarrhoea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . Aristolochic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> inhibits
          inflammation induced by immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonimmunological</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (carrageenan or croton <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          ] . Aristolochic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> inhibits the activity of snake
          venom phospholipase (PLA 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) by forming a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 40 38</NUMEX> ] . Since phospholipase enzymes play a
          significant part in the cascade leading to the
          inflammatory and pain response, their inhibition could
          lead to relief of problems from scorpion envenomation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] .
          
          Barleria lupulina is well known in
          Thai folk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> as an antiinflammatory, and is used
          against snakebites and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">varicella zoster virus lesions</ENAMEX> and
          showed activity against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> clinical isolates of herpes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">simplex</ENAMEX> virus type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compounds</ENAMEX> found in the

          acetylshanzhiside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl ester</ENAMEX>, ipolamiidoside and
          iridoid glucosides [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> and
          immunostimulant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was reported from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and patented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
          
          Bauhinia excisa <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine decoction</ENAMEX> has
          been used for snakebites and pain and the root decoction
          is used for scorpion stings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indigenous Mayans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eastern Nicaragua</ENAMEX>
          use 
          Caspicum frutescens for fever,
          respiratory problems and infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 53</NUMEX> ] .
          Capsaicinoids are powerful skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">irritants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capsaicin</ENAMEX> is a vanillylamide with hyperemic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaesthetic</ENAMEX> properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 61</NUMEX> ] . It causes
          vasodilatation, enhanced permeability and has
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiinflammatory</ENAMEX> and neurotransmitter activation
          properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . Capsicum <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have inhibitory
          effects on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bacillus species</ENAMEX>, 
          Clostridium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and 
          Streptococcus pyogenes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capsaicin</ENAMEX>'s use in the treatment of chronic pain is
          due to an analgesic effect that is explained by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsaicin</ENAMEX>'s action of depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> of substance P
          from primary sensory neurons as a consequence of the
          reduced production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 60</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capsaicin</ENAMEX>'s antiphlogistic activity is due to the
          "counter-irritant effect"; which means that a local
          irritant effect exerts an additional more remote
          antiinflammatory effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . This is explained by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberation</ENAMEX> of corticoids under the influence of certain
          cutivisceral reflexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . The counter-irritant
          effect on the gastric mucosa also occurs because

          Tobago that were learning to walk [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walkfast</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corrimiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>

          Xiphidium caeruleum ground stem
          infusion or decoction is drunk as an antiemetic and the

        Conclusion
        It is suggested that the medicinal plants exert a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> action on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> or his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. Plant use is
        based on odour and plant morphological characteristics.
        Plant use is embedded in a complex cultural context based
        on the ancient beliefs of indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Amerindians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Columbian healers also use ethanolic extracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> for
        snakebites, prepare snakebite remedies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> and choose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> according to the Doctrine of
        Signatures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">139</ENAMEX> ] . The cultural basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> use
        does not mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have no effect. Some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> mentioned contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that may explain the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnomedicinal</ENAMEX> and ethnoveterinary use. For instance some
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> influence the immune system or like 
        Lepianthes are effective against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> and external parasites. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Plant baths</ENAMEX> with species
        such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepianthes</ENAMEX> and 
        Phyllanthus that have compounds
        showing analgesic, antiinflammatory and antibacterial
        effects may contribute to the health and well being of the
        hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. The multiple plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> found in 
        Phyllanthus species merit further
        investigation. Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that show potential efficacy
        against skin conditions are 
        Momordica , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solanum</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernonia</ENAMEX> . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jatropha</ENAMEX> and 
        Justicia species contain compounds
        with potential in wound healing. 
        Eclipta prostrata and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constituents</ENAMEX> (wedelolactone, stigmaterol and sitosterol)
        showed good potential against crotalid venoms. The
        carcinogenic risk cited in the literature on aristolochic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] needs to be evaluated versus its potential
        benefit as an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> for snake and scorpion
        bites.
