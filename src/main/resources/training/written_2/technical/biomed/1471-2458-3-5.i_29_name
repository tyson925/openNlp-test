        Rhinoviruses have been associated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40% to 65%</NUMEX> of
        "common colds" studied by methods of virus culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        . With the use of reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain
        reaction (RT-PCR), rhinovirus has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> of all colds throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and up
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> of colds during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> outbreak period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Rhinviruses have been implicated in the exacerbation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> symptoms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and may even play a role in asthma
        related deaths [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Due to their role in the
        exacerbation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> symptoms, rhinoviruses are a major
        cause of pediatric hospitalizations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhinoviruses</ENAMEX> have been thought to be
        transmitted via large droplets or contact [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , studies
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980</TIMEX>'s demonstrated that fomites are not an
        effective means of transmitting rhinovirus infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . While direct inoculation of respiratory secretions
        has been shown to transmit infection, this is not a likely
        route of transmission in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> as
        survival on hands is brief [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airborne</ENAMEX> transmission of
        infection was clearly demonstrated in one experimental
        study on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies designed to conclusively identify
        modes of transmission, the role of airborne transmission in
        viral respiratory infection remains controversial.
        An impediment to future studies of airborne transmission
        of respiratory infections is the lack of established
        methods for the detection of airborne respiratory
        microorganisms appropriate for epidemiological studies.
        Several laboratory studies have been conducted in which
        aerosolized respiratory viruses have been collected and
        quantified with culture based methods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . These
        studies were conducted to determine the effects of
        temperature and relative humidity on the infectivity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> viruses, but their methods are not suitable for
        the extremely low concentrations of virus in field
        experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> have been employed to detect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airborne</ENAMEX> respiratory viruses in a number of small studies
        conducted in hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] and in pig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        To determine if airborne microorganisms can be
        inactivated, and therefore, prevent infection transmission,
        studies during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940's-1970</TIMEX>'s used ultraviolet
        germicidal irradation (UVGI) to inactivated airborne
        microorganisms under experimental conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX>
        ] and reduced airborne infections in a number of settings,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , military housing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and
        classrooms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX> was not effective against
        the highly contagious measles virus when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> had
        extensive contact in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and crowded tenements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ]
        . Thus, it fell into disfavor and has not been extensively
        employed nor has it been studied using molecular methods of
        detecting its efficacy.
        Because we anticipate future studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX> will use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> based detection methods, it is important to determine
        how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays react to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX> damaged genetic material. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX> predominately produces damage in the form of
        cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-4</ENAMEX>) photoproducts. These
        photoproducts disrupt the replication of the genetic
        material and, therefore, inhibit the replication. There is
        limited information regarding the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
        There are conflicting studies on viruses with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genomes
        that have attempted to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays are
        inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UVGI</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies involving <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis A</ENAMEX> virus
        (single-stranded positive sense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genome</ENAMEX>) and rotavirus
        (double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genome</ENAMEX>), showed their PCR assays to be
        inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> inactivation of the viruses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma et al</ENAMEX> showed no effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay
        when they irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poliovirus</ENAMEX> (single-stranded positive
        sense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genome</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In this study, we present an
        extremely sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCR</ENAMEX> based assay to detect airborne
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhinovirus</ENAMEX> and demonstrate the effect of ultraviolet
        irradiation on the assay.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Organism</ENAMEX>
          We obtained rhinovirus 16 strain 11757 from ATCC
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>) with a titer of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 7.25particles</NUMEX> per
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> ml. The suspension was diluted with phosphate
          buffered saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) to create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different
          concentrations to be used in the experiment.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerosolization</ENAMEX> and chamber description
          We generated a rhinoviral aerosol with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-jet
          Collison nebulizer (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CN-38</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BGI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waltham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">generates 2-Î</ENAMEX>¼m mass-median diameter (MMD) droplets when
          run at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> psig of air pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The nebulizing
          solution consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, diluted virus, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uranine</ENAMEX>. We used the uranine as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fluorescent tracer</ENAMEX>, so
          that some filters could be used to determine the
          percentage of actual collection versus theoretical
          collection. The aerosol was generated in a specially
          designed aerosolization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> that had been used in
          studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> sensitivity of 
          Serratia marcescens and bacilli
          Calmette-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GuÃ©rin</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> parts: a drying jar, a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> mm square duct where the aerosol first enters the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>, a UV exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, and sampling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>. We
          attached a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collison</ENAMEX> nebulizer to the drying jar, where
          the aerosol is given time to dry, before entering the
          square duct through a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">manifold</ENAMEX>, which creates a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformly</ENAMEX> distributed aerosol. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aerosol</ENAMEX> next enters
          the UV exposure chamber. The UV exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> is
          comprised of a fused quartz UV exposure window (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">279 Ã— 254</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mm</ENAMEX>), on which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six 36-watt</NUMEX> UV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lamps</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumalier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>) sits. We inserted
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of screens beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture</ENAMEX> to adjust the
          level of irradiance. Downstream of the exposure chamber a
          slide contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is used to collect
          the aerosol sample with our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling</ENAMEX> filters (Teflo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>
          Î¼m pore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pall Gelman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Arbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>) mounted in
          filter cassettes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bedford</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) while the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> can be loaded with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teflo</ENAMEX> filters in series, to allow a bypass while
          changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> filters. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> filters were used in the
          bypass to ensure that no aerosol escaped the chamber. The
          multiple ports allow changing of filters without
          interrupting the aerosol flow. Makeup air passes through
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teflon</ENAMEX> filter prior to entering the chamber to prevent
          environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microorganisms</ENAMEX> from entering the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>.
          Filtered air was pumped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> at a rate
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> l/min monitored by a rotameter. To provide
          additional protection, the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was
          housed within a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Class II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type A</ENAMEX> biosafety <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>.
          Although temperature <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">and %</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> were not controlled, they
          were measured with continuous monitors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOBO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H08-004-02</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> data loggers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onset Computer Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bourne</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling</ENAMEX> filters.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerosol</ENAMEX> procedures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airflow</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was maintained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">l/min</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. We then began the aerosolization of
          the rhinoviral solution and allowed the aerosol to flow
          through the bypass filter for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>. Air samples
          were then collected for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sampling</TIMEX> runs
          that included testing for effects of UV exposure, the UV
          radiation was turned on and allowed to warm up for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> while airflow was directed through the bypass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>. An air sample was then collected for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> replicates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> exposed and nonexposed particle
          samples were collected during each sampling run. Aerosols
          were exposed to an irradiance level of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 mW</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m</ENAMEX> 2for 22.8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">684 mJ/m 2</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiking</ENAMEX> experiments
          Prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aerosol</ENAMEX> experiments, we spiked filters
          with progressively more dilute viral suspensions to
          determine the limit of detection of our extraction and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">semi-nested RT</ENAMEX>-PCR assay. For spiking, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> was
          placed on the filter as a wetting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼l
          of diluted virus. Filters were and allowed to dry prior
          to extraction. We also spiked one filter prior to each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerosol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> run as a positive control. To test the
          stability of virus on the filters, a test was conducted
          in which spiked filters were used to collect air samples
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, which has single pass air
          and is therefore an unlikely source of rhinovirus.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX> extraction
          We placed the filters face down in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mm petri dish
          using sterile forceps. We then added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX> Î¼l of prepared
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVL</ENAMEX> buffer containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrier RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen QIAamp Viral</ENAMEX>

          After placing the lids on the dishes, the dishes were
          secured to an orbital <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tabletop shaker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VWR Scientific</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Products, Thorofare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>) and rotated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX>. After shaking, we pipeted the eluted
          material from the petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> into a sterile microfuge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          We extracted the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the filter samples with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          protocol. The use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit</ENAMEX>
          resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼l</NUMEX> of purified viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semi-nested RT</ENAMEX>-PCR amplification

          Uranine analysis
          Uranine was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fluorescent tracer</ENAMEX>, which
          allowed us to determine a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> yield for each sampling
          run. To determine the amount of aerosol collected on each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>, uranine analysis was conducted on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> filters
          per sampling run, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> each from the beginning, middle and
          end of each run. The filters used for uranine analysis
          were removed from cassette <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> and placed into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          mm test tube with sterile forceps. We added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          to each tube and sonicated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> with vortexing
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every 15 minutes</TIMEX>. We also collected samples of the
          nebulizing fluid before and after nebulization. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and nebulizing fluid samples were diluted with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N NaOH</ENAMEX> and analyzed with a spectrofluorometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">excitation 485</ENAMEX> nm and emission <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">535</NUMEX> nm) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tecan Corp.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrafluor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mannedorf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>). We averaged
          the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> filters to calculate an
          estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> yield for the sampling run.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The amount of uranine nebulized during each sampling
          run was determined by measuring the amount of fluid
          consumed and by measuring the fluorescence of nebulizing
          fluid before and after each sampling run. Using the total
          aerosolization time during the sampling run, we
          determined the amount of uranine that theoretically would
          be on each filter if we collected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the aerosol
          generated during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 10-minute</TIMEX> exposure of each filter.
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filter samples</ENAMEX> that were analyzed for uranine,
          we determined the actual amount of uranine collected per
          sample. We averaged the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filter samples</ENAMEX> per run and
          divided by the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uranine</ENAMEX> consumed to
          determine <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a percent</NUMEX> yield (observed/expected) for the
          sampling run.
          We computed the expected number of TCID 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> on each filter sample from the
          known TCID 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> and fluid volume added to the
          nebulizer, the amount of nebulizing fluid consumed per
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX>, and the sampling time. The expected TCID 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> was adjusted for the yield for the
          uranine samples.
        
      
      
        Results
        We were able to obtain from the dilution gradient filter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments a positive band from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 1</TIMEX>:500,000
        dilution of virus, which translates into a detected amount
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.77</NUMEX> TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 or 0.39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFU</ENAMEX>'s per filter. The
        stability tests, in which, filters spiked with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> /filter were used to collect air
        samples for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 hours</TIMEX> did not display any difference in band

        and relative humidity were recorded in the air downstream

        was very consistent, ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26.4Â°C</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27Â°C</NUMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">%RH</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.9</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50.7</NUMEX>.

        nonexposed filter samples.
        In order to determine if the uranine in the viral
        suspension was inhibiting the extraction and detection
        assay, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> otherwise identical runs were conducted - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>
        with and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> without uranine. Each sampling run was
        conducted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nebulizing solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1</NUMEX> TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> per ml. Results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> runs were
        identical, demonstrating that the uranine was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> to the extraction or RT-PCR assay.
      
      
        Discussion
        The majority of rhinoviral transmission among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> is
        thought to occur via airborne infectious droplet nuclei [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX> ] . This study was conducted to assess the ability to
        detect airborne rhinovirus on air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling</ENAMEX> filters and
        documents the first successful attempt to detect airborne
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhinovirus</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> amplification-based techniques.
        These techniques allow for a highly sensitive method to
        conduct air sampling for rhinovirus. This assay also is
        capable of detecting aerosolized enterovirus, although
        future studies are necessary to confirm the limit of
        detection for enteroviral aerosols
        Our limit of detection for the collection, extraction
        and amplification of aerosolized rhinovirus was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> TCID 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments we
        conducted had a limit of detection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.8</NUMEX>
        TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of what was detected when the
        virus was aerosolized. These results can be interpreted in
        several ways. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the virus may be
        damaged during the process of aerosolization in the
        Collison nebulizer, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the damaged virus
        cannot be amplified. This explanation would account for the
        results shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2where</NUMEX> the nebulization solution
        prior to aerosolization yielded a positive result while
        after aerosolization we obtained a negative result. Another
        possible explanation is that it is easier to extract the
        virus from a dried liquid droplet, as was done in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments, than from an aerosol spread uniformly
        over the filter surface.
        We were unable to recover the majority of aerosol that
        was expelled into the chamber. The main reason for the low
        yields appears to be the result of large droplets falling
        out in the drying jar prior to entry into the exposure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>. Because the yields were the same regardless of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> status, the low yields should not affect our
        results.
        Previous studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> inhibits PCR assays
        in single and double stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] while
        our RT-PCR method did not detect a difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX>
        exposed and nonexposed rhinoviral aerosols. The most likely
        reason for this is a matter of dose, although it is
        possible that characteristics of the particular viruses and
        PCR methods could also explain the results. Neither of the
        previous studies were conducted on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aerosolized</ENAMEX> virus and
        the dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> was several orders of magnitude greater.
        This study, did not determine whether the rhinovirus
        aerosol was capable of infection after exposure to the high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> dose used in these experiments. It is possible that the
        UV irradiation damaged other regions of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
        not the region that our primers amplified, or that the
        amount of damage required to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> amplification
        is greater than the amount of damage sufficient to prevent
        infection. This suggests possible future studies to
        investigate the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> damage,
        infectiousness, and detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> of various regions
        of the rhinovirus genome.
        The limit of detection of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> must be put into
        context with the amount of virus shed by an infectious
        individual. A study of rhinoviral shedding detected a titer
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1,600</NUMEX> TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> per ml of nasopharngeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wash</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>
        out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . So it is clear that
        infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can produce a large amount of virus, but it
        is unknown how much of that virus becomes airborne through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coughs</ENAMEX>, sneezes, respiration and talking.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies have attempted to determine the infectious
        dose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ) of rhinovirus for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ]
        . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for microorganisms depend on at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> criteria: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the strain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
        route of transmission, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the method of inoculation, and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) host immunity. In a study published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Biological Laboratories</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disease</ENAMEX>, conducted a series of tests designed to determine
        if respiratory viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX> were transmitted via the
        aerosol route. Using rhinovirus type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, they inoculated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> in the nose with both nasal drops and an aerosol
        (particle size <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 to 2.5 Î¼m</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> estimated a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ID</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX> TCID 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for nasal drops and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX> TCID 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for aerosols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . In a study
        conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> inoculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> with
        rhinovirus type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> with droplets of viral suspension in
        several locations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for nasal drops was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX> TCID 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . If we assume that the
        infectious dose is acquired through an aerosol, the aerosol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> suggests that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> can detect an amount
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equal to twice the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. But, if the spiking
        experiment is a better estimate of actual detection limit
        due to the inactivation by the nebulizer, then our
        detection limit is approximately equal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> .
        Caution must be taken when interpreting results from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based air samples. Nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> detection methods, such
        as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> presented here, are capable of detecting very
        small quantities of microorganisms, but these techniques
        cannot determine if the microorganism is infectious at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of detection.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The filter collection and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based detection methods
        developed here offers some clear advantages over the use of
        more traditional methods such as impinger collection and
        cell culture based detection. The use of filter collection
        allows for a much longer sample time, while impingers
        cannot be used for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 15-20 minutes</TIMEX>. As was
        demonstrated here, filters can be used to collect at least
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-hour</TIMEX> samples without reduced ability to detect virus on
        the filter. Cell culture methods, while useful in
        determining the amount of infectious virus, could not be
        used to detect the very low levels of infectious virus
        present in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> air because collection of viable virus over
        long sampling times is not currently feasible. Therefore,
        the use of filter collection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> based detection is the
        only method presently available to detect low
        concentrations of respiratory virus in air. However, at UV
        doses much higher than typically used in upper room UV
        applications, this method was unable to distinguish between
        UV irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aerosols</ENAMEX> and nonexposed aerosols.
