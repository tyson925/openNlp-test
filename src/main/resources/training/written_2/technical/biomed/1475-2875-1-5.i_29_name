        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Reversible protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is gaining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> as a potentially important mechanism of
        post-translational regulation in protozoan parasites,
        especially those belonging to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apicomplexan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The
        dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins is universally
        catalyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatases</ENAMEX> that are classified into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tyrosine phosphatase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTP</ENAMEX>) and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine phosphatase (PP)
        although enzymes with various degrees of dual-specificity
        are also encountered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatases belong to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">namely PP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2B</TIMEX> (calcineurin), and possess
        similar primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in their catalytic cores [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 6</NUMEX>
        ] . PP1, in particular, exhibits an extremely high degree
        of sequence conservation through evolution, and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> and isoforms are found in all eukaryotic cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . In various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP1</ENAMEX> regulates such diverse
        cellular processes as cell cycle progression, protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, carbohydrate metabolism, transcription, and
        neuronal signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7</NUMEX> ] , underscoring its profound
        importance in biology. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphatases</ENAMEX> are
        differentially affected by natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxins</ENAMEX> such as okadaic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (OA) and microcystin-LR. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">characteristic IC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> fall in the range:
        PP2A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nM</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-80</NUMEX> nM, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP2B</ENAMEX> is highly
        resistant to both [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 7</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, tautomycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">affects PP1</ENAMEX> and PP2A nearly equally, but fails to inhibit
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, a number of phosphatase
        activities and putative sequences have been reported in 
        P. falciparum [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . These include a
        PP2A [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP2B</NUMEX>-like activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , a unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP2C</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> putative sexual-stage
        phosphatases - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPÎ±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPÎ²</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and a
        tetratricopeptide repeat-containing phosphatase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        . Preliminary studies revealed the presence of a protein
        phosphatase activity in crude extracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBC</ENAMEX>-grown 
        P. falciparum that exhibited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-sensitivity resembling that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uninfected RBC</ENAMEX>, in contrast, possessed mainly a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP2A</NUMEX>-like
        activity. Because of its potential importance in a variety
        of signalling pathways of the parasite, we have turned our
        attention to defining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP1</TIMEX> phosphatase and its
        regulation in 
        P. falciparum .
        In this communication, we report the exact sequence of a
        PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> in 
        P. falciparum , the corresponding
        gene sequence in 
        P. falciparum chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymatic</ENAMEX> properties of the recombinant enzyme, and its
        inhibition by mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">physiological</ENAMEX> PP1-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>,
        namely, inhibitor-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-1</ENAMEX>) and inhibitor-2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX>).
        Post-transcriptional gene silencing using synthetic short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interfering RNA</ENAMEX> (siRNA) molecules has been recently used to
        ablate specific mRNAs and thus, produce phenotypic
        mutations in specific genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . We have adopted
        this technology to knockdown specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        viruses that are obligatory intracellular parasites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . In the present study, we have successfully used a similar
        strategy to generate phenotypic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1</NUMEX>-deficient 
        P. falciparum parasites.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Identification of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP1</NUMEX> cDNA sequence
          Various pairs of oligodeoxynucleotide primers were
          designed on the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PlasmoDB</ENAMEX>-predicted mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene chr14</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.phat</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">133</ENAMEX>), and employed in reverse
          transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification using Pf3D7
          total mRNA as template. Based on the prediction, primers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'ATGGCATTAGAAATAGATATAGATAATG 3</ENAMEX>'(primer A in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the
          start codon in bold) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'TTATTTCCGACAAAAAGAAATATATGG
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'were <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tested, but no product was obtained. Since
          there was no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> within a reasonable distance
          upstream that was in the same reading frame, we proceeded
          on the assumption that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end of the mRNA might be
          different. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> primer was replaced by a
          series of nested primers (based on the genomic sequence),
          each of which was paired with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">primer A</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The
          combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">primer A</ENAMEX> and the primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'TTTTTTAATTTGCTGCTTTCTTTTTTTCC 3</ENAMEX>'(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) eventually
          produced a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> product that was cloned into pGEM-T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> and sequenced. The cDNA sequence contained a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">915-nucleotide</TIMEX> long open reading frame corresponding to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">polypeptide 304</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in length and ending with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAA</ENAMEX> stop codon.
          Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (in Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIGR</ENAMEX>) revealed that the
          coding sequence is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> exons, of which the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are the largest and contain most of the
          catalytic core of the phosphatase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          intron sequences are pronouncedly more AT-rich than
          exons, and contained homopolymeric repeats, a feature
          which, in our experience, is common in 
          Plasmodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          BLAST analysis of the predicted primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> revealed its clear identity with the PP1
          class (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). It is to be mentioned that among all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> has been subjected to the most
          extensive structure-function analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In fact, it was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatases
          for which the three-dimensional structure was solved [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> alignment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2demonstrates
          the high sequence conservation between the human and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. The
          catalytic core of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP1 and PP2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          are very conserved, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly corresponds</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This region contains all the
          signature motifs and conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that have been
          shown to be important for the fundamental steps of
          catalysis, including substrate binding, metal ion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordination</ENAMEX>, and interaction with the phosphate group [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . It is to be noted that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">304</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> is the shortest PP1 known to date, and
          lacks a short proline-rich stretch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Expression and catalytic properties of PfPP1
          In order to characterize the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP1</NUMEX> cDNA we subcloned
          it into pET-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15b</NUMEX> such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is expressed with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -tag. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, a protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 37,000</NUMEX> Mr was produced from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pET-15b-PfPP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX>, which is in agreement with the
          predicted molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34,904</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP1</ENAMEX> and roughly
          another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> added for the (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> region of pET-15b (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> specifically reacted with a monoclonal
          anti-His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and also with a polyclonal antibody
          against full-length human PP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transduction Laboratories</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KY</ENAMEX>). The recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was purified
          through nickel-chelation chromatography and tested for
          phosphatase activity. It dephosphorylated the small
          substrate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p NPP</ENAMEX>, as well as histone, labelled
          at Ser <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, it also showed decent
          activity on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyr</ENAMEX>-phosphorylated synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX>. The V
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> values <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Î¼mol Pi liberated / mg</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">enzyme/ min</ENAMEX>) against these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> substrates (pNPP,
          phosphoserine-histone, phosphotyrosine peptide) were,
          respectively: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 +2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 +1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 +0.5</NUMEX>. An equivalent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein fraction</ENAMEX>, obtained from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> containing vector alone
          (without insert), showed no activity against any of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. It has been recently shown that rabbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>,
          expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , also possessed Tyr
          phosphatase activity. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native PP1</ENAMEX> isolated
          from rabbit muscle or expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sf9</TIMEX> insect cells
          contained only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity but no Tyr
          phosphatase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . It was concluded that this
          apparent difference might be due to subtle changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folding</ENAMEX> in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cellular
          environments. It remains to be seen whether this is a
          general feature of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX>.
          To obtain biochemical evidence for the identity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recombinant PfPP1</ENAMEX>, we tested the effect of specific
          phosphatase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and selected mutations on the
          phosphatase activity. Mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Asn122</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp</ENAMEX> by
          site-directed mutagenesis destroyed the phosphatase
          activity, confirming the essential role of this residue
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> in catalysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . PfPP1 was inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaF</ENAMEX>,
          inorganic orthophosphate, and pyrophosphate at respective
          IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          (data not shown). Similar values were recently obtained
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . PfPP1 was
          also inhibited by tautomycin, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> with IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400, 7</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These values are comparable to
          those obtained with various PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> recombinantly
          expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 29</NUMEX> ] . The sensitivity
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PfPP1</NUMEX> to these natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxins</ENAMEX> is consistent with the
          fact that the loop sequence between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²12 and Î²13</NUMEX>
          regions plays a direct role in binding these toxins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] , and this sequence is entirely conserved in PfPP1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Recently, a few additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are
          closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP1</TIMEX> sequence have also
          been shown to be important in the interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-2</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] ; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> numbers, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E52, E54,</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D164</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E165</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K166</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> PP1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Glc7p</NUMEX>), the
          double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E52A/E54A</ENAMEX> and the triple mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D164A/E165A/K166A</ENAMEX> showed IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX> that were
          respectively <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 300</NUMEX> times the wild type enzyme values
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, a similar loss of inhibition
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX> was also observed when the corresponding mutations
          were introduced into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>, although they did not affect
          the catalytic activity (specific activity) (data not
          shown). Together, these results provide experimental
          confirmation of the catalytic identity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> PfPP1
          As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, inhibition studies using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> and
          calyculin A suggested the existence of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX>-like
          activity in 
          P. falciparum extracts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          However, our attempts to purify the native <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP1</NUMEX> enzyme
          by chromatographic procedures resulted in only small
          amounts of activity, probably due to rapid inactivation
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fractionation</TIMEX>. To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> is expressed
          in 
          Plasmodium , we have, therefore,
          taken an immunological approach. First, cell-free
          extracts of different erythrocytic stages of 
          P. falciparum were subjected to
          Western blot using a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that was raised
          against nearly full-length human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> and showed a broad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species specificity</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the expected size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> k was
          observed in all stages including gametes. A peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, specific for human PP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>),
          did not detect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. The gametogenesis was confirmed
          by the appearance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pfg27</TIMEX>, an early gamete-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Having demonstrated that the monoclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>, we used it in an attempt
          to inhibit PfPP1 activity 
          in vitro . At optimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> almost completely inhibited
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> inhibition) recombinant PfPP1 (including its Tyr
          phosphatase activity), and also inhibited the phosphatase
          activity of the 
          P. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">falciparum</ENAMEX> extract by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX>
          (data not shown). Under the same conditions, the
          human-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> had no effect. Finally, it has
          been shown that affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resins</ENAMEX> containing immobilized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcystin</ENAMEX> specifically bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-sensitive
          phosphatases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP2A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Thus, we
          passed soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytosolic Pf extract</ENAMEX> through
          microcystin-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sepharose</ENAMEX>, and the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE followed by immunoblot using the
          anti-PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The blot revealed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> kDa
          PfPP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polypeptide</ENAMEX> indeed specifically bound to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcystin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B), correlating the antigenic
          reactivity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> with its affinity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>.
          Pre-incubation of the extract with microcystin
          specifically prevented binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PfPP1</NUMEX> to the
          column.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of phenotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> mutants by PTGS
          using RNAi
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi), mediated by short interfering
          double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules (siRNA or dsRNA), is now
          recognized as a major mechanism of post-transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene silencing</ENAMEX> (PTGS) in essentially all eukaryotes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          ] . Recently, the technique has been successfully applied
          to cultured mammalian cells, whereby introduction of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide</NUMEX> long synthetic dsRNA molecules
          corresponding to specific mRNA sequences effectively and
          specifically degraded the cognate mRNAs and abrogated the
          expression of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . This
          prompted us to test a similar approach to knockdown PfPP1
          function in the erythrocytic 
          P. falciparum stages. Our initial
          attempts with standardized transfection procedures using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OligofectAMINE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA</ENAMEX> did not produce an appreciable loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>. We
          then resorted to the electroporation procedure originally
          developed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA transfection</ENAMEX> in 
          Plasmodium by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellems</ENAMEX> and
          co-workers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , as detailed under <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of results shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6clearly demonstrates loss of PfPP1 by the RNAi
          procedure, while the control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP2A</ENAMEX> was not significantly
          affected. Loss of PfPP1 resulted in concomitant
          inhibition of parasite growth as evidenced by the drastic
          reduction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-hypoxanthine incorporation. These results
          suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP1</ENAMEX> plays an essential role in 
          Plasmodium replication. The facts
          that the parasite culture was asynchronous, i.e.,
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> (ring, trophozoite, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schizont</ENAMEX>) (data not shown) and that the effect of dsRNA
          was severe, suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> is required for cell cycle
          progression at all stages of the parasite. This is
          further supported by the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 protein</ENAMEX> in all
          the parasitic stages (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Taken together, this is
          consistent with the established role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> in eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and cell cycle progression, as discussed
          below.
          PP1 is one of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatases</ENAMEX> found in
          all eukaryotic cells. The activity of the catalytic
          subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> is controlled by its interaction with a
          large number of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX>, many of which also
          target it to specific subcellular compartments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 24 33</NUMEX>
          ] . The major ones include the glycogen-targeting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , myofibrillar-targeting

          PP1 (NIPP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> nuclear targeting subunit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNUTS</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] , mitosis-regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit Sds22</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>

          inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DARRP-32</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dopamine</ENAMEX> and

          The physiological role of many of these interactions has
          been revealed in recent studies. A temperature-sensitive
          mutant of the yeast PP1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Glc7</NUMEX>), for example, exhibits a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase of the cell division cycle, and
          elevated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sds22</ENAMEX> suppresses this defect [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          ] . Structure-function analysis of recombinant mammalian
          PP1 has recently begun to map specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved
          in interaction with other molecules. Interestingly, all
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>, and a few examples
          are presented here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> peptide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast PP1 ortholog</ENAMEX>,
          Glc7, have demonstrated a role of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 residues</ENAMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> interaction. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PfPP1</TIMEX> sequence,
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I167</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L241</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F255</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L264</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C289</TIMEX>, and
          F291 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As mentioned, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²12</NUMEX>-loop<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Î²13</NUMEX> region,
          important in interaction with natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , is
          fully conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, recently
          shown to be important for interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DARPP-32</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          ] , are also conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>; these are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Met288</ENAMEX> and
          Cys289 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We have provided experimental evidence
          of an important role of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">invariant residues</ENAMEX> of
          PfPP1 in the interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Based on
          such overwhelming conservation of functionally important
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, we propose that orthologs of many of these
          PP1-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may also exist in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> and function in similar
          roles. The use of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> and protein-protein
          interaction techniques should aid in characterizing these
          physiological regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX>. Our ability
          to generate PP1-deficient 
          P. falciparum parasites will allow
          us to study the "mutant" phenotype in further detail and
          understand the role of this highly conserved phosphatase
          in malarial biochemistry and pathophysiology. These
          studies are in progress.
          As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] described a
          putative phosphatase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX> in 
          Plasmodium , the mRNA of which was
          detected in the sexual stages of the parasite. The
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPÎ±</ENAMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">889</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> long,
          and contained a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal 345</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, containing
          the putative catalytic domain, had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> unique peptide
          stretches that were called "inserts". When these inserts
          were omitted from the alignment, the rest of the sequence
          showed significant similarity with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          ] . Clearly, further studies are needed to identify the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPÎ± protein</ENAMEX> and characterize its potentially interesting
          identity.
          While our manuscript was being written, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McRobert</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McConkey</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] achieved similar success in using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> strategy to ablate dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHODH</ENAMEX>) of 
          P. falciparum . Although the
          protein level was not directly monitored, the loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHODH</ENAMEX> mRNA was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. This resulted in
          inhibition of parasite growth, consistent with the role
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHODH</ENAMEX> in pyrimidine biosynthesis, essential for
          parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> introduced the
          double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> by electroporation also, using
          conditions very similar to ours. Thus, although the exact
          mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> uptake remains to be elucidated, the
          electroporation procedure must have allowed the dsRNA to
          traverse the various erythrocytic and parasitic membranes
          to enter the parasitic cells.
          The success in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ablating PfPP1</TIMEX> is particularly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gratifying</ENAMEX> to us on a number of accounts. As mentioned,
          PP1 is a highly conserved enzyme, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatase activities are also found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Thus, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 inhibitors</ENAMEX>, such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">okadaic acid</ENAMEX> or tautomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) would affect the
          parasite as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, making conclusions
          difficult. The dsRNA, in contrast, is known to be
          extremely specific for its intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, such that a
          single nucleotide mismatch prevents its action [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          This has allowed us to create specific phenotypic loss of
          PfPP1. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> will permit the ablation of
          essential gene products, at any time point in infection,
          or on a desired parasitic stage following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synchronization</ENAMEX>. Lastly, traditional genetic manipulation
          in eukaryotes, including the 
          Apicomplexa, is a relatively
          difficult and elaborate procedure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . Thus, we
          believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> strategy will become a powerful and
          convenient tool in 
          Plasmodium functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX>,
          particularly in the studies of phylogenetically conserved
          signalling molecules.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        
        P. falciparum contains a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> protein
        phosphatase that is virtually identical to its orthologs in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in both sequence and biochemical properties.
        Based on the established physiological role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> in other
        organisms such as mammals and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> may regulate a
        variety of parasitic pathways, including glycogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression, and cell cycle progression.
        Indeed, the successful use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference to ablate
        PfPP1 confirms its essential role on parasitic growth. The
        catalytic subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP1</ENAMEX> is expressed in all the
        erythrocytic stages of the parasite and is specifically
        inhibited by mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">physiological inhibitors</ENAMEX>,
        inhibitor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and inhibitor</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Thus, an in-depth study of
        PfPP1 and its interacting subunits may shed light on the
        regulation of the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> in this clinically
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of parasites.

          monoclonal anti-PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was raised against a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.6</NUMEX>
          kDa fragment of human PP1Î± (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residue 5-226</ENAMEX>), and was
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transduction Laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KY</ENAMEX>).
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> reacts with all mammalian and avian PP1
          tested, but does not react with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> classes. The
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 antibody</ENAMEX> (a kind gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Honkanen</ENAMEX>) was
          specific for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX>, and was raised in rabbit against

          of human PP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PITPPRNSAKAKK; Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The anti-PfPP2A

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). Microcystin-coupled sepharose
          was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Placid, NY</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Amplification, cloning, and mutagenesis of PfPP1
          cDNA
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from asynchronous 
          P. falciparum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D7</NUMEX> cells grown in
          human A-positive erythrocytes essentially as before [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] . Various pairs of primers were designed on the
          basis of the relevant sequences of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of the primers were in the
          range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65-72Â°C</TIMEX> in order to achieve high specificity in
          reverse transcription (RT) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> reaction
          was carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> hrs using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> therm.
          polymerase kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Molecular Biochemicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX>. No.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2016311</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> reaction was incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>,
          carried out using a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>) and Pfu
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>) polymerases (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to ensure high fidelity [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elongation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62Â°C</TIMEX>. The
          various products were gel-purified and cloned in pGEM-T
          by "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> cloning" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). The clones were initially
          screened by restriction analysis and finally confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>.
          All site-directed mutagenesis were performed using the
          megaprimer procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , and the mutations were
          confirmed by sequencing. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> was carried out
          by cycle sequencing using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRISM Big Dye Terminator</ENAMEX>
          sequencing kit and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AmpliTaq DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX>,
          Division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE/ABI</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Expression and assay of recombinant PfPP1
          phosphatase
          Growth and induction of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli BL21</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>) containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pET-15b-PfPP1</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIG plasmid</ENAMEX> were carried out using
          procedures described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 48</NUMEX> ] , except that the
          culture was grown at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18Â°C</NUMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM MnCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> concentration was lowered
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> mM. The (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -tagged PfPP1 expressed from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pET-15b-PfPP1</ENAMEX> was purified through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX> +2-chelation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] as described by the manufacturer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM MnCl 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> being present in all the buffers.
          The imidazole-eluted His-tagged PfPP1 was dialyzed
          against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris-Cl</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
          glycerol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> (buffer A), and stored in small
          portions at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Phosphatase activities were assayed essentially as
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19 52</NUMEX> ] . Unless otherwise mentioned, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          Î¼l reactions contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM of MnCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and requisite amount of recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> in buffer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> Where mentioned, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> was directly
          added to the reaction. When <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-2</ENAMEX> was used, it was
          pre-incubated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP1</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min.</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-1</ENAMEX> was
          prephosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX> in a standard kinase reaction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 200 Î¼M</ENAMEX> Î³-thiophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. 32P-labelled
          histone was prepared by phosphorylation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">presence of Î³- 32P</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>] essentially as described,
          followed by removal of the free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> by gel filtration [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 52</NUMEX> ] . The resultant phosphohistone is exclusively
          phosphorylated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . 32P-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide EAI</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yp</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAPFAKKK</ENAMEX>, phosphorylated at the single Tyr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">residue by pp43 v-</ENAMEX>ablkinase, was prepared essentially as
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 52</NUMEX> ] . Phosphatase reactions were
          initiated by the addition of the substrate. The liberated
          32P was quantitated by a phosphomolybdate extraction
          assay as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Reactions were
          followed with time, and results were corrected by
          subtraction of the corresponding values from an
          enzyme-free reaction.
        
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> PfPP1
          
          P. falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3D7</ENAMEX> was grown on
          A-positive human erythrocytes in the presence of
          homologous serum as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . When
          needed, cultures were synchronized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 54</NUMEX> ]
          : (i) schizonts were purified by flottation over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percoll</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>) followed by incubation with

          were then left to mature into rings and treated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          D-sorbitol for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. The purity of individual
          stages was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 95%</NUMEX> as confirmed by microscopic
          observation of a stained thin smear of the culture.
          Sexual stage parasite was generated as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          .

          The negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luciferase RNA</ENAMEX> was the same as
          the double-stranded GL3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were annealed 
          in vitro to form double-stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (dsRNA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and electroporation was carried out
          essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In brief, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 Î¼g</NUMEX> dsRNA in
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">800 Î¼l</NUMEX> of incomplete cytomix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] was added to infected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBC</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> parasitemia), and electroporation was
          performed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> at settings of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200 Î©</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kV, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼F</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> cells were identically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporated</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The cells were then grown in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-well plates in triplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, and measurement of
          3H-hypoxanthine incorporation was carried out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr
          post-electroporation using standard procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] ,
          except that parasites were liberated with saponin,
          pelleted, and counts in the pellet measured following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubilization</ENAMEX>. Parasites from unlabelled but otherwise
          identical cultures were analyzed in Western blot using a
          mixture of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> and anti-PfPP2A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (see
