        Injuries to nerve or tissue cause an immediate sensation
        of pain, or acute pain, which resolves with the resolution
        of the injury. Less commonly, these injuries produce a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of pathological states that produce
        chronic pain that is unresponsive to the analgesics used to
        treat acute pain. It would be therefore of great interest
        to map the characteristic features of gene expression
        following nerve injuries, as they may reveal mechanisms of
        chronic pain and genetic targets for the design of novel
        therapies. In this study we apply the powerful microarray
        technology to study the injuries of the brachial plexus, a
        typical form of nerve injury from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> or workplace
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incidences</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Since this is largely a paper focusing
        on methodology, we refer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to our website [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        for details of the brachial plexus injuries.
        The goal of this study, detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX> or
        state-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, is an
        important problem in the context of microarrays. Fold
        changes and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> tests have been applied to
        microarray datasets to yield lists of genes that have
        undergone altered expression under a certain significance
        threshold. Although these methods are useful in identifying
        potential gene targets, they are best applied to small sets
        of hypothesis tests. In the context of microarray
        experiments where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes are commonly evaluated
        simultaneously, the probability of detecting false
        positives rises sharply. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recently proposed algorithms
        seeking to address this multiple testing problem,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Significance Analysis of Microarray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM) and Westfall</ENAMEX> and
        Young step-down adjusted 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values, will be investigated in our
        study. We note at the outset that our investigation of
        methods for detection of such differentially expressed
        genes has several limitations. Firstly, it is based solely
        on the brachial plexus injury data which, in turn, is
        limited by small sample sizes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>). However, such small sample sizes are
        characteristic of many current microarray studies, in view
        of technologic expense, so that exploration in this setting
        is purposeful. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, our investigation is largely
        empiric, there being no overarching theory by which to
        arbitrate competing approaches. Nonetheless, it is the
        frequently observed heteroskedasticity of gene expression
        measurements that motivates our extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX> (see below) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> was designed to evaluate the significance of changes
        in gene expression between different biological <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> assigns a score to each gene (here and below what
        we refer to as genes are actually probe sets on the chip
        that target full length cDNAs or ESTs) as an index of the
        relative difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. A gene is labeled as
        significant if its score surpasses a threshold. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> terms
        the percentage of genes identified by chance the false
        discovery rate (FDR) and estimates this quantity by
        recourse to permutation. The threshold can be adjusted to
        identify different sizes of sets of putatively significant
        genes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDRs</ENAMEX> are modified accordingly. We note here that
        this differs from the formulation and sequential control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDRs</ENAMEX> as originally proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hochberg</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        ; see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storey</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tibshirani</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] for
        discussion of the distinctions and considerations pertinent
        to microarray data analysis. Throughout, we will use FDR in
        the sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>. Tusher, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">et al.</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAM</ENAMEX> to study the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response of lymphoblastoid cells to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ionizing</ENAMEX> radiation, and they were successful in identifying
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> biologically meaningful genes. A different algorithm,
        proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> and adapted by Dudoit 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] for microarrays, tackles
        the multiple testing problem from a different angle. It
        controls the family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), which is
        the probability of having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> false positive among
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> tested. It provides less conservative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> than the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonferroni, Šidák</ENAMEX>, and Holm
        corrections and is able to handle the dependence (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulation) among gene expression profiles. In a study
        that tested whether alterations in the expression of genes
        related to high-density lipoprotein metabolism affects the
        expression of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, multiple-testing methods
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that showed significant altered
        expression levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scavenger receptor BI</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in apolipoprotein AI-knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Further discussions, additional approaches and comparisons
        can be found at [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        In the comparison of expression levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 5000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> between normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and brachial plexus
        injury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we adopt both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall & Young</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> using regular 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics assuming equal variances
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics assuming unequal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variances</ENAMEX> (hereafter called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics). The
        application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics is motivated by the work of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In their paper, they
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied Welch</ENAMEX> tests on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia dataset</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and
        demonstrated the importance of allowing for unequal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variances</ENAMEX>. Following a similar approach, we have identified
        a set of known and novel genes that largely fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cytokines / neurotrophine</ENAMEX>, myelin function,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction, cytoskeleton, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcription /</ENAMEX>
        translation and others. Some genes are confirmed by
        literature; others still require explanation and future
        research. We also compared the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westfall & Young</ENAMEX> algorithms, as well as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics. In
        this study, we hope to provide a framework for future
        experimental research in avulsion injuries and pain. In
        addition, we illustrated the use of appropriate multiple
        testing methods for microarrays in monitoring differential
        gene expression between different biological <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> displays for test statistics
          Figure 1is a scatter plot of the intensity readings
          for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P15</NUMEX>) and the corresponding readings of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C1</NUMEX>). The considerable deviation from the
          identity line indicates that gene expression is
          substantially disturbed as a consequence of the avulsion
          injury. For comparison, the scatter plots for a pair of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and a pair of patient data sets clearly show less
          deviation.
          The frequency distribution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics and the normal Q-Q
          plot for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics are provided in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Both the histogram and the Q-Q plot show that
          the distribution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics is not normal.
          However, in our study we are more interested in
          identifying genes with substantial 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics than in testing the
          distribution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics that deviate markedly
          from the bulk of the observations were labeled as
          potentially having biological significance and may
          deserve further investigation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Plots of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics against average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> and different components of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics against each other
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) are especially useful in identifying genes
          with substantial statistics and in studying the features
          of these genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The average intensity for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is the average of the mean expression level for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, large 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics were easily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> and labeled in red. They correspond to the
          same genes identified as outliers in the Q-Q plot (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that have the largest 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics do so by virtue of
          having denominators <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>, implying near constant
          expression levels. Further, their expression levels are
          observed to be very low. Consequently, these genes might
          be of little biological interest. In order to more
          systematically evaluate differential expression and
          complement these graphical approaches, we next apply
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>.

              Experimental outline
              We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> methodology to identify genes with
              statistically significant changes in expression. For
              the 
              i thgene a modified 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic, 
              d(i) , was used to quantitate
              differential expression.
              
              All quantities here and below are defined in the
              Methods section. The 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> factor was added to help ensure
              that the variance of 
              d(i) is independent of gene
              expression level and to mitigate problems caused by
              small denominators. A similar strategy derived from a
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> approach is detailed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In order to
              select an appropriate 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> value for this dataset, we
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plotted Δ</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> using different values of 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that calculating
              
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              0 according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tusher</ENAMEX>, 
              et al. prescription yields a
              value equal to the minimum of the pooled standard
              deviations over all the genes, which fails to reduce
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDRs</ENAMEX>. We therefore elected to set 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thpercentile of the
              pooled standard deviations ( 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
              <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>); this choice does reduce
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX>.
              As Δ increases, the number of significant genes
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreases</ENAMEX>, but at the same time the percentage of
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falsely</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also decreases. The curve of FDR
              vs. Δ in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> generally decreases
              monotonically as Δ increases, but from some Δ on the
              decrease flattens markedly (see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
              choice of Δ is somewhat arbitrary, but is driven by
              choosing an acceptable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> and an appropriate number
              of significant genes. We choose Δ = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, corresponding
              to an FDR at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>. This yields a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> significant
              genes that are described next. Not surprisingly, the
              concordance between genes identified via graphical
              methods and those selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> is high.
            
            
              Genes identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-SAM</ENAMEX>

                Mild tissue damage, nerve damage and infection
                produce inflammation and associated pain. This
                results in the migration of immune cells to the
                site of injury, which is followed by release of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> identified as
                significant by 
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX> have been reported in
                the literature as relevant to the inflammation and
                pain pathways. Interleukine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> inhibits
                inflammatory cytokine production. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midkine</ENAMEX> is
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with neurite growth and was recently
                discovered to have potent neuroprotective activity
                in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . IGFBP6 plays a significant role in
                the differentiation, maintenance and regeneration
                of the central cholinergic neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
                Cysteine-rich fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> is
                also implicated in neuronal growth and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrkA</ENAMEX> plays a crucial role in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and function of the nociceptive
                reception system.
              
              
                Myelin function
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified that are involved in
                myelin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and myelination: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPZ</ENAMEX> (myelin
                protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLP1</TIMEX> (myelin proteolipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX>)
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBP</ENAMEX> (myelin basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>). Defects in these
                genes are the cause of demyelinating
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuropathies</ENAMEX>.
              
              
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> transduction
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frizzled</ENAMEX> play roles in apoptosis. The
                down regulation of both might represent a cellular
                response to prevent neurons from death.
              
              
                Cytoskeleton
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: Myosin light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, Myosin heavy

                notable in this category. The altered expression of
                them together suggests a probable link between
                calcium signaling and rearrangement of the
                cytoskeleton, possibly leading to long-term changes
                in neuronal morphology.
              
              
                Others
                <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MT-III</ENAMEX> has been recently implicated as being
                involved in sensory and nociceptive transmission [
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . Its down regulation might also lead to
                promotion of neurite extension to promote recovery
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] showed that in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> microarray study setting the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic assumption of equal
            variances between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could result in poor
            performance. We therefore extended the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> framework to
            include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics. Under the assumption of
            unequal variances, the associated degrees of freedom
            are variable, and the strict monotonic decreasing
            relationship between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values and test statistic
            values no longer holds. Accordingly, it is misplaced to
            use the values of the statistics under permutation.
            Rather, for each data permutation, we standardized the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> statistic using an appropriate 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> referent distribution and used
            the resultant " 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values" as described in the
            Method section; see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . By
            so taking into account between<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> heterogeneity,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch-SAM</ENAMEX> identified a set of up regulated genes that
            were not detected by 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX>. Several of these up
            regulated genes are engaged in transcription and
            translation regulation: transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
            transcriptional coactivator <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pc4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrf2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EIF5</TIMEX> (Eukaryotic
            translation initiation factor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), and PABPL1
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">polyadenylate</NUMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX>). In addition, two
            genes are involved in cell cycle regulation:
            Autoantigen pericentriol material and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>-like kinase.
            Their identification suggests a secondary mechanism to
            repair the damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>. The entire list of genes
            identified by 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch-SAM</ENAMEX> can be found
            at [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">t-SAM</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch-SAM</ENAMEX>
            The relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> and Δ for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> is also
            included in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The un-pooled variance in the
            denominator of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> statistic is highly unstable under
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutation</ENAMEX> in this small sample setting. Consequently,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch-SAM</ENAMEX> is not a smooth function of Δ, as is
            the case of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> values for selected
            Δs for both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch-SAM</ENAMEX> when 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was chosen at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thpercentile
            of standard deviations, are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1along</ENAMEX> with
            corresponding numbers of significant genes and false
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> step-down
          adjusted pvalues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>'s step-down adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values were calculated using both
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.
          As before, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values are not monotonely related
          because of the variation in degrees of freedom. So, we
          again calibrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> statistic against the
          appropriate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> referent distribution and
          determined (unadjusted) " 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values" for each permutation. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smallest Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.053</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.042</NUMEX> respectively. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5illustrates</NUMEX> the relationship
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values and the number of genes
          being tested. A small simulation shows that this
          relationship is governed by the number of true null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> in the tests (unpublished data). Profiles for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> selected genes are displayed; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics are presented in
          Figure 5Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX>-statistics in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>. For each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, the adjusted 
          p value increased with the increase
          of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">null genes</ENAMEX> being tested. Genes with
          smaller statistics had greater adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values and their adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values increased at a greater
          rate when the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">null genes</ENAMEX> being tested was
          larger.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWER</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX>
          In a single hypothesis test, a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> I error occurs
          when a true hypothesis is rejected. In multiple testing,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWER</ENAMEX> refers to the probability of rejection of any true
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. When many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> are tested, such as
          expression data of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes being compared
          between different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWER</ENAMEX> increases dramatically,
          and is typically much larger than the significance level
          at which the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> are tested.
          As defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaffer</ENAMEX>, given any test procedure, an
          adjusted 
          p value corresponding to the test
          of a single hypothesis H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> is the level of the entire test
          procedure at which H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> would just be rejected, given the
          values of all test statistics involved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Several
          approaches have been proposed to calculate adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values for the purpose of
          providing control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWER</ENAMEX>. Among these, the method
          developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> is best suited for
          microarray data analysis. It is superior to the
          single-step methods proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Šidák</ENAMEX> by
          allowing different 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values to be adjusted
          differently; therefore the power of the procedure is
          improved. It is also able to take into account the
          dependence structure between variables. In a biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may
          correlate with each other for various reasons such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulation.
          However, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>'s permutation
          algorithm was applied to calculate step-down adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values in our dataset, only one
          of the adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics
          reached a conventional significance level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. A few
          factors might contribute to the absence of adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values at that significance
          level. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost, the small sample sizes are
          limiting. Furthermore, the unbalanced allocation of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) controls limits the precision of the
          adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. The number of
          permutations we can do is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285</NUMEX>. A more balanced
          experimental design will increase the number to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          choose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus 1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the vast majority of
          genes are expressed at low levels, as depicted in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, where biological signals may become indistinguishable
          from noise. For those cases where the difference in mean
          expression levels is small, a pooled standard deviation
          that is also small can give rise to a significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX>, where in fact no difference exists. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5shows</TIMEX> that adjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values are sensitive to the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">null genes</ENAMEX> being tested. Given that many genes
          are likely to be irrelevant to the biological processes
          underlying the brachial plexus injuries and hence are
          expected to show little difference in their expression
          levels between injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, it
          is not surprising that no significant result was obtained
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t -SAM</ENAMEX> when applying the complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5we</NUMEX> also try to illustrate the
          potential abuse of using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filtered gene subsets</ENAMEX> (based on
          statistics measuring differential expression) to achieve
          significant results, given that such filtering is
          commonplace in microarray literature. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX>, although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>'s algorithm is more powerful than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonferroni, Šidák</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm</ENAMEX> adjustments by taking into
          account the joint distribution of the test statistics, it
          may still be too stringent. The same result also occurred
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tusher</ENAMEX>, 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] when applying this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to study the transcriptional response of
          lymphoblastoid cells to ionizing radiation. A less
          stringent method may therefore be needed to analyze
          microaray data.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> provides a different point of view on how the
          errors in multiple testing should be controlled. Having
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> rejected signals clearly that many
          hypotheses are not true. It is therefore more crucial to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the rate of false positives among all rejected
          hypotheses than the probability of one single erroneous
          rejection. It might thus be argued that the control of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> is a more appropriate approach to dealing with the
          multiplicity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. That argument is especially true in
          the setting of microarray data analysis, where one is
          more interested in studying as many relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as
          possible, and less interested in sacrificing possible
          targets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of making one mistake [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The
          algorithm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tusher</ENAMEX>, 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] provides an estimate
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> for each value of the parameter Δ in the
          application of microarray settings. The estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> is
          computed from permutation of the data and allows for the
          possibility of dependent tests [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . We derived a set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> significant genes using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>, out of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> were
          false positives, giving rise to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> is not able to disclose the identities of these false
          positives, it does provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> a reasonable set of
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> genes and a sense of the trustworthiness
          of the outcome. By estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> by permutations of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> assumes that all null hypotheses are true;
          hence the estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> is biased upward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storey</ENAMEX> and
          Tibshirani tackled this problem by multiplying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> by an
          estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses, π 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . A detailed description of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Storey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tibshirani</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Following their approach, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> false discovery rate is
          lowered to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13%</NUMEX> by assuming that not all hypotheses
          are null. Further recent comparisons of multiple testing
          procedures are provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheung</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-statistics vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics
          We applied both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics identified a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having
          increased expression in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that were not
          detected by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics under the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stringency</ENAMEX>. One can argue that the active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have
          greater variability in gene expression than inactive ones
          have [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Such a difference will be reflected in
          larger variances in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relative to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a scenario more appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
          statistics than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics. In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) in our analysis might be in different
          conditions. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might have more tissue damage
          and/or more severe pain than others. Further, the patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is likely to be inherently more heterogeneous with
          respect to the extent of tissue damage and other relevant
          yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unmeasured</ENAMEX> attributes. These considerations also
          argue for the appropriateness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
          statistics conformed better than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics to their regression
          modeling approach used to discover differentially
          expressed genes in a microarray setting where
          between<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> heterogeneity was evident [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . There
          are drawbacks, however, to using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.
          Firstly, they need to be calibrated, introducing
          distributional assumptions. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, and more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, there are stability and power concerns that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertain</ENAMEX> in small sample settings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The use of high-density microarray technology to
        identify specific genes that are expressed differently
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more biological conditions is particularly
        relevant to drug discovery and development. However, in the
        context of microarray data analysis, multiple testing
        concerns are forefront. In this study, we attacked the very
        important problem of application of appropriate multiple
        testing methods in identifying differential gene
        expression, and in addition, we have provided a framework
        for future experimental research in brachial plexus
        injuries and pain pathways. Simple statistical summaries,
        such as fold change, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics,
        have been applied. To further investigate some recently
        proposed multiple testing schemes, we compared the
        performance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>
        step down adjusted 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values, as applied to a microarray
        study of gene expression in a brachial plexus injury. Our
        results show that using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> and controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FDR</ENAMEX> leads to
        identification of a set of potentially interesting genes
        consistent with prior knowledge of their function. In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> readily quantitates the trade-offs between
        false discovery rates and numbers of selected genes. On the
        other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> algorithm, by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controlling FWER</ENAMEX>, is highly conservative in this small
        sample setting. To the extent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWER</ENAMEX> provides
        appreciably more stringent selection, attendant findings of
        significant differential gene expression are more likely to
        be validated (by follow-up experiment) than those deriving
        from FDR-controlling methods. However, there has been
        recent recognition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 21</NUMEX> ] and our study also shows that
        FWER-control can be unnecessarily stringent since falsely
        selecting a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will not be a serious problem if the
        majority of differentially expressed genes are chosen
        correctly. In addition to comparing multiple testing
        algorithms, we also compared the performance of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics.

        By taking into account the heterogeneous nature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics identified a set of genes
        having increased expression in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, whereas
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were not selected by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics under the same
        criteria.

          Materials
          Briefly, cervical avulsed human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>)
          were removed in the setting of a dorsal rhizotomy of
          lower cervical (and upper thoracic in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case) nerve
          roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with persistent pain syndromes after
          accidental avulsion injuries. Details on obtaining,
          processing and measuring the expression of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human DRG</ENAMEX> and control tissue samples are located
          elsewhere <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://itsa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/~yxiao/Avulsion.</ENAMEX> The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control human DRG</ENAMEX> sample was pooled from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>; prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) obtained from post-mortem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. The pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> was then run in triplicate
          (n=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the tissue by Trizol
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LifeTechnologies</ENAMEX>) extraction and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA +RNA</ENAMEX> was
          recovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligotex</ENAMEX> mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spin Columns</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>).
          Biotinylated cRNA targets were prepared and hybridized to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HU6800</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide arrays according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis methods
          
            Normalization
            All data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preprocessed</ENAMEX> (background subtraction, differential
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneChip</ENAMEX> software, and
            average differential intensity (ADI) was used for
            analysis. The average of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> values of each chip
            was calculated and the mean of average values of all
            chips was used as the target intensity. The ADI value
            of each chip was normalized to be equal to the target
            intensity. Since negative, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and very small
            positive values (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><20</NUMEX>) of ADI most likely represent
            noise instead of actual gene expression, all such
            values were truncated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,638</NUMEX> probe
            sets for analysis.
          
          
            Graphical display
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quantile-Quantile</ENAMEX> plot (Q-Q plot) was generated by
            plotting the quantiles of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics of all genes against
            the quantiles of a standard normal distribution. In
            addition to examining the distribution of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics, we used this plot
            to observe points that deviate markedly from the bulk
            of the observations since they may represent difference
            in means of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
            scatter plots were generated to study the features of
            large 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> statistics:

            conducted. For each permutation 
            b , 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values were calculated and
            ordered in the way of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Expected

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. For a fixed threshold Δ, a probe set was called
            "significant" if its

            The total number of "significant" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> was
            counted. The

            cutoff value were found and were called "falsely
            significant". The total number of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> was
            counted. The estimated number of "falsely significant"
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> was defined as the average of the number of
            "falsely significant" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> from all permutations.
            The false discovery rate (FDR) was computed as the
            ratio of the estimated number of "falsely significant"
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> to the total number of "significant" probe
            sets.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDR</ENAMEX> was computed with different values of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
            statistics were used to compare gene expression between
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Our data were organized
            in a matrix in which each row represents the expression
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and each column represents
            the expression of all genes for one subject. The
            permutation algorithm developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>
            to obtain step-down adjusted 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values was then applied as
            follows. Note that the procedures were modified when
            using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX> statistics. Instead of using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
            statistic to compute adjusted 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values, we used unadjusted 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>
            statistics and the appropriate degrees of freedom. An
