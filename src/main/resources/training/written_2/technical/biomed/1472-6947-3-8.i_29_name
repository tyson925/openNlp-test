          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinical Importance</ENAMEX> of a Precancer
          Classification
          The best medical discoveries are generalizable. For
          example, if antibiotics were only effective on a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Fleming</ENAMEX>'s chance discovery would have
          had limited medical value. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> have common
          biological properties (e.g. a cell wall, small size,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) that make them different from <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Knowledge of the general properties of bacteria
          can inspire therapeutic strategies that extend its value
          to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteriologists</ENAMEX> learn
          the names of all the different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and group the
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> based on shared properties.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteriologists</ENAMEX> use their knowledge of bacterial classes
          to develop new antibiotics and new therapeutic
          strategies.
          Classification efforts typically begin by listing all
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the classification domain (i.e. creating a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomy</ENAMEX>). Until now, there has been no effort to list
          the precancers and or to associate precancer terms with
          their synonyms. Any given precancer may have been studied
          by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> using different terms for the
          same lesion. Absent a definitive terminology, distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> may have been studied under the same name. The
          absence of a comprehensive precancer terminology severely
          limits the clinical value of research that includes
          precancer specimens.
          Until now, there has been no effort to group the
          precancers by shared clinical, morphologic or
          biomolecular features. If an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> were discovered that
          induced regression of a particular precancer, there would
          be no organized precancer classification prompting anyone
          to select biologically related lesions likely to respond
          to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
          It is the opinion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> that precancers
          should have a biological classification. Database
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> using the precancer classification will
          provide a mechanism whereby each precancer, its' related
          precancerous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> known to develop
          from these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, can be linked with relevant data
          contained in biological data sets (e.g. gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> and proteomics arrays, tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX>,
          pathology data sets).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Informatics Aspects of Classification</ENAMEX>
          Modern classifications serve as informatics devices
          capable of linking, integrating and retrieving
          information contained in diverse biological data sets.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Creators</ENAMEX> of biomedical databases use terminologies to
          annotate individual data elements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> annotation
          involves appending descriptive information to
          experimental data with the intention of creating an
          encapsulated data object that can be intelligently
          connected to related data in other databases. Annotations
          are a critical part of the data, because the annotations
          assist in the discovery of the biological relevance of
          the data element. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lesions</ENAMEX> annotated with terminology from
          the same classification can be linked, even when they
          occur in heterogeneous data sets.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>, a new type of data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has emerged that will greatly enhance
          the research value of publicly available datasets. This
          model is the self-describing data collection. In this
          model, all of the data fields are tagged by metadata.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metadata</ENAMEX> is data that describes the data elements. XML
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Extensible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mark-up Language</ENAMEX>) is the most popular format
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metadata annotation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The precancer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> is embodied in an XML file. The data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the classification are instances of the
          precancer domain and the properties of the domain
          instances. Examples of precancer data elements are values
          such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DCIS</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Actinic</ENAMEX> keratosis" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">000932</ENAMEX>" and
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ENG"</ENAMEX>. The metadata are the flanking tags such as
          <concept>, <synonym>, <cui>, and
          <language>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precancer XML</ENAMEX> file itself is
          annotated with sufficient information that anyone opening
          the file can fully understand the file contents.
          Now and in the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> will need to
          organize their data in a way that permits thoughtful
          analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> will be producing terabytes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, in the form of images, tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">micoarrays</ENAMEX>, gene
          expression arrays and proteomic arrays. None of this data
          will have any value unless it is described in a standard
          manner that computers can understand. Classifications
          exist to organize the instances of a domain so that
          information assembled from databases can be generalized
          or related to defined taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precancer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Terms</ENAMEX> in
          Use
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">carcinogenesis</TIMEX>, morphologically identifiable
          lesions occur that precede the development of invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are called precancers,
          premalignancies, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preneoplastic lesions</ENAMEX>, incipient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, intraepithelial neoplasias, and preinvasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. The plethora of terms reflects the difficulty of
          choosing a "best" canonical class term for the
          precancerous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. Currently, the term
          "intraepithelial neoplasia" seems to enjoy wide usage
          among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of pathologists, but this term has
          limitations:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Not all epithelial precancers are intraepithelial.
          Most of the mucosal dysplasias have a well-defined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">territory</ENAMEX> bounded by the junction between the epithelium
          and the underlying stroma. But not all premalignant
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> can be identified by the presence of
          atypical cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> delimited by a basement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. Dysplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, kidney,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thyroid</ENAMEX> and adrenal are not delimited by a basement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Not all precancers are epithelial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          Intratubular germ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> neoplasms of testis,
          myelodysplasias, and non-autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lymphomas</ENAMEX> are
          examples of non-epithelial precancers.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Not all intraepithelial neoplasms are precancers.
          Neoplasms that are intraepithelial but that are not
          precancers include: seborrheic keratoses, intraepidermal
          nevi, common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">warts</ENAMEX> and most so-called benign epithelial
          tumors.
          Likewise, the term pre-invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> raises an
          existential question. Use of the term "pre-invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>" implies that precancers have attained the
          biological properties of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. This assumption may
          not be true. Precancers may lack constitutive properties
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or may have certain attributes that are absent
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. At this point, there is insufficient
          knowledge to conclude that precancers are types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In this article, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> use the term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX> because this term conveys only the defining
          features: occurrence prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, and existence as
          an identifiable lesion.
          When considering all the possible classes of
          precancers, it is worth noting that:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Not all precancers are neoplastic. A diffusely
          hyperplastic lesion with no known neoplastic properties,
          but with a frequent association with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> arising from
          the hyperplastic tissue, would be considered a precancer.
          Examples include diffuse atypical endometrial
          hyperplasia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-associated lymphoid hyperplasia,
          helicobacter-associated gastric MALT hyperplasia, diffuse
          gastric intestinal metaplasia, etc.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precancers</ENAMEX> need not progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and often
          have a high rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regression</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . The low-risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> suggests a strategy for treatment
          based on enhancing the intrinsic regression rate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, when a precancer progresses,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is the obligate outcome (i.e. precancers never
          progress into types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>). This
          biological property allows us to infer that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that
          induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precancers</ENAMEX> are carcinogens.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The different kinds of precancers may vary in every
          biologic feature except those specified in their
          definition (identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> that precede the
          development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">precancers</TIMEX>, by definition,
          are the morphologic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> that precede <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, one can
          expect precancers to occur in a somewhat younger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Using the same line of reasoning, one can expect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (chemical or biological) that induce precancers to
          also induce <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The biological diversity of precancers
          When the different precancers are listed, it becomes
          apparent that they fall into very different biological
          classes. Consider the following three <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, all of
          which are usually considered to be precancers:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Squamous dysplasia of the uterine cervix. Squamous
          dysplasias are microscopic foci of atypical squamous
          cells. They are not tumors in the sense that they do not
          present as a growing mass. In the cervix, they are almost
          always associated with a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">etiology</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Tubular adenoma of colon. Tubular adenomas are
          benign tumors that can measure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several centimeters</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>. Nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">atypia</ENAMEX> can be minimal or marked.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX>'s esophagus. This is a glandular metaplasia
          occurring in the esophageal mucosa caused by local
          chronic inflammation. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> typically show no
          nuclear atypia. They are associated with an increased
          risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
          What do these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> have in common? They are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">identifiable lesions</ENAMEX> that can precede the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Other than that, they would seem to have very few
          features in common. The diversity of biological types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX> calls for the creation of a precancer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Creating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precancer Classification</ENAMEX>
          A classification is a hierarchy of taxa (informative
          features that characterize an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and distinguish it
          from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>) and a set of generalizable features
          that apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of taxa. For instance, if "chair" is
          classified under "furniture," then we can expect that all
          of the generalizations that we can form on the topic of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furniture</ENAMEX> will apply to chairs. This is actually a
          remarkable concept as it allows us to apply general
          knowledge to specific items. Even if I know nothing about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chairs</ENAMEX>, knowing that a chair is a type of furniture
          allows me to infer many things about chairs based on my
          general knowledge of furniture. If furniture is something
          that belongs in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, then a chair belongs in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX>
          The task of classification usually begins by listing
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a domain (in this case, every precancer)
          and then choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that carry the greatest number
          of informative biological generalizations to every member
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The list of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a domain is
          called a taxonomy. A classification is a grouped taxonomy
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          The process of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">classifying lesions</ENAMEX> is different from
          the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">identifying lesions</ENAMEX>. Identification
          involves assigning a name [from an existing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>] to a lesion. The distinction between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and identification is of great importance,
          because classification schemes, unlike identification
          schemes, have properties that can be of immense
          importance in medical research [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A classification contains every instance in its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, and every instance has a single and unique slot
          in the classification. This facilitates the design of
          experiments that include every instance of related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Good classifications contain classes carefully
          selected to have the maximally informative set of
          generalizable features common to all the class instances.
          Having a classification allows us to compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          different instances based on the inherited properities of
          their classes.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Classifications support annotation using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the classification (classes and instances) as
          keys. Database annotation can be used to improve the
          classification system.
          Classifications are also different from ontologies.
          Ontologies create logical rules between specified members
          of a group [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Ontologies are expected to have
          "competence", the ability to respond to queries that draw
          from the formal relationships among group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. A
          classification approach was chosen, because the two
          primary goals of this effort were to create a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> listing of precancer terms and to provide a
          broad hierarchy for precancer concepts. Establishing a
          set of logical rules for the precancers is, at this time,
          not feasible.
        
        
          What precancer classification is currently
          available?
          ICD-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diseases</ENAMEX> -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncology</ENAMEX>) lists virtually no precancerous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          The ICD-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> registrars to annotate, in a
          uniform way, cases of treated malignancies. With a few
          exceptions (such as ductal carcinoma in situ of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>)
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> registries do not collect information on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surveillance</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology</ENAMEX> and End Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEER</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> use data collected by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer registries</ENAMEX> to compile national statistics on the
          incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The most comprehensive summary of
          the clinical and pathologic features of precancers is
          found in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pathology of Incipient Neoplasia</ENAMEX>", edited by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albores-Saavedra</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . None of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> provides a classification of the precancers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precancer Classification</ENAMEX>
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Acquired microscopic precancers
            These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of when
            they hear the term precancer. All of the so-called
            intraepithelial neoplasias fall into this category.
            Most examples of the microscopic precancers occur
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commonly</ENAMEX> (actinic keratosis, cervical dysplasia). They
            tend to be multifocal. They tend to be non-inherited
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX>, often with an identifiable causation (e.g.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sunlight</ENAMEX>, human papillomavirus infection). They seldom
            occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Exceptions are inherited diseases
            that heighten sensitivity to a causal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, such as
            the early appearance of actinic keratoses in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xeroderma Pigmentosum</ENAMEX>. Morphologically, they tend
            to have a high degree of nuclear atypia. The
            microscopic epithelial precancers grow by a subtle
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of the normal mucosa, without producing a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX>, despite many replicative cycles of growth. They
            progress to invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> while still relatively
            small. The term dysplasia is often applied to these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. Dysplasia, in the context of precancer, is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">somatically</ENAMEX> inherited nuclear atypia. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytologists</ENAMEX> use
            the morphologic features of dysplasia to identify
            precancer cells. Class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">precancers</ENAMEX> often have an
            identifiable non-dysplastic stage that precedes the
            appearance of nuclear atypia (e.g. squamous metaplasia
            of bronchus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX>'s esophagus without atypia,
            junctional nevus, intestinal metaplasia of stomach)
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Acquired large <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> with morphologic
            atypia
            These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend to have a uniform appearance
            throughout most of their long existence, even from the
            smallest size (i.e. they have a long, stable growth
            phase). They tend not to have precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> from
            identifiable microscopic precancers (e.g. class 2
            lesions do not seem to arise from class 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>).
            Their chance of becoming malignant usually increases as
            the size of the lesion increases. When they become
            malignant, there is usually a morphologically apparent
            focus from within the large lesion that has crowding,
            irregular growth pattern and marked cellular atypia
            that is strikingly different from the surrounding
            cells. This focus enlarges, shows frank invasion, and
            is the presumed origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that develops from
            the precancer. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend not to regress
            spontaneously. They tend to be long-lived and do not
            progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> without first growing to a large
            size. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are often multiple but do not occur
            in large numbers (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>) unless there is a germline
            mutation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prototypical</ENAMEX> acquired large precancers are
            colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenoma</ENAMEX> and myelodysplasia
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Precursor lesions</ENAMEX> occurring with inherited
            hyperplastic syndromes that often progress to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
            These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend to occur very rarely in the
            general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but may occur with a high
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probability</ENAMEX> (sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> carrying the
            germline mutation. The prototypical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are the
            Ret-gene disorders. Mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RET</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders multiple</ENAMEX> endocrine
            neoplasia, type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MEN2A</NUMEX>), multiple endocrine
            neoplasia, type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MEN2B</NUMEX>), and hereditary medullary
            thyroid carcinoma.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lesions</ENAMEX> in this general category tend to have a
            single gene mutation that may be the only lesion found
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">precursor lesions</ENAMEX>. The precuror <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend to
            have the morphology of simple hyperplasias, without
            much nuclear atypia. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Precursor lesions</ENAMEX> tend to be
            multiple, sometimes occurring in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>, and
            bilateral in paired organs. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend to occur
            in a much younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> than the acquired
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX>. The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> can also occur at a
            relatively young age.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Acquired diffuse hyperplasias and diffuse
            metaplasias
            With few exceptions, acquired small focal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaplasias</ENAMEX> and hyperplasias have a very low chance of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and have been excluded from the
            classification schema because they rarely result in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> without first growing into diffuse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> (the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">class 4 lesions</ENAMEX>) or acquiring nuclear atypia (class 1
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>).
            Diffuse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metaplastic lesions</ENAMEX> commonly precede
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. It is presumed that all bronchogenic squamous
            dysplasia arises from squamous metaplasia. The normal
            bronchus simply does not have any squamous cells. The
            squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in bronchial squamous dysplasia must
            have originated from a metaplastic focus for directly
            from non-squamous bronchial cells that differentiated
            directly to a dysplastic squamous phenotype.
            The prototypical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are the diffuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX>'s
            esophagus, diffuse intestinal metaplasia of stomach,
            and diffuse endometrial hyperplasia. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> tend
            to have chronic identifiable causes (e.g.
            gastroesophageal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">reflux disease</ENAMEX>, post <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lye</ENAMEX> ingestion
            esophagus, chronic gastritis, long-term tamoxifen
            therapy), and tend not to regress so long as the
            causation persists. Small foci of dysplastic precancers
            (Class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) may arise from the diffuse hyperplasias and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaplasias</ENAMEX>.
            This class of precursor may include the so-called
            regressing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, such as helicobacter-associated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maltomas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaposi</ENAMEX>'s sarcoma that can
            grow as multiple tumors, all of which can quickly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regress</ENAMEX> when the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is withdrawn (e.g.
            after antibiotic treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter</ENAMEX> or after
            normal immune status is restored after withdrawal of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> in transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> may
            also include secondary aplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> (e.g. benzene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicity</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> is repopulated by an
            emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of hyperplastic cells that carry a
            a heightened risk of progressing to acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Currently unclassified entities
            Most precancers will fall into one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            described classes. However, classifications may contain
            a subset of cases that defy facile classification. For
            example, the platypus has challenged animal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classifiers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle</ENAMEX> had no trouble recognizing that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX> were mammals, but it took the scientific
            community <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> millennia to agree.
            We have created an "unclassified" category of
            precancers for the current draft classification
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superclass</ENAMEX> and modifiers
            A superclass is created to contain general precancer
            terms (e.g. precancer, dysplasia)

        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX>'s esophagus.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> collected precancer terms from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMLS</ENAMEX>.
        After review of the terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> added supplemental
        terms from their own knowledge. Every additional term added
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> matched a pre-existing UMLS concept. About
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the precancer synonyms were contributed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
        After the terminology was assembled, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> created
        a classification system and assigned each precancer term to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the precancer classes. The entire classification was
        prepared as a metadata document using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> (eXtensible

        In the example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> metadata tags are employed:
        <concept>, <cui>, <precancer_class>,
        <term>, <synonym>, along with and their
        corresponding closure tags (marked by a slash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>).
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> is case-sensitive, lower-case letters were
        consistently employed to simplify implementation. The
        <concept> tag indicates that a new concept will
        follow. Since all of the precancer concepts derive from or
        correspond to existing UMLS concepts, it was convenient to
        assign each precancer concept with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMLS Concept Unique</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Identifier</ENAMEX> and mark these with a <cui> tag. Each
        precancer concept is assigned one of the precancer classes.
        In this case, the term "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTLD</ENAMEX>, post-transplant
        lymphoproliferative disorder" is assigned to the precancer
        class of "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Acquired diffuse hyperplasias</ENAMEX>/metaplasias." The
        term is flanked by <term> tags and the class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designation</ENAMEX> is flanked by <precancer_class> tags.
        Because the term is a synonymous variant, it is nested in
        <synonym> tags. Term and synonym tags are used for
        each of the term variants of the single concept.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raw XML</ENAMEX> files are made difficult to read by the large
        quantity of markup (XML tags) that annotate data elements.
        Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> files are made readable with transformation
        scripts or with embedded presentation instructions

            considered a putative precancer (even when the evidence
            seemed doubtful), it was added to the taxonomy.
          
          
            Issues of exclusion
            How does the classification deal with conditions
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> but for which no precancerous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> is known? These conditions are often called
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer syndromes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> identified (possibly through
            genetic testing) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer syndrome</ENAMEX> who have not
            yet developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> may be considered to be in a
            precancerous stage of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. In the absence of
            morphologically identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">precancerous lesions</ENAMEX>,
            these conditions were excluded from the classification.
            Since these syndromes may have enormous relevance to
            our understanding of the carcinogenic process, they
            were collected as a separate listing. When the
            precancer classification undergoes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> review,
            these syndromes may be added as a distinct class. It is
            available as a supplemental file with this publication
            [see Additional file: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].
          
          
            Issues of unclassifiability
            Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">precancerous lesions</ENAMEX> fit into a biological
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. In most cases, the unclassifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are
            concept "placeholders", such as "atypical squamous
            cells of undetermined significance."
          
          
            Issues of omission
            Because the classification was completed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, it is presumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in the field
            of precancers will wish to add <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the taxonomy.
            This may be particularly important for veterinary and
            comparative pathologists, as the current classification
            is heavily weighted toward human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Issues of incorrect classification
            Classifications are hypotheses about the nature of
            their subject domain. A taxonomist needs to place every
            known instance (precancer, in this case) somewhere in
            the classification. Once this is done, the
            classification can be tested and re-organized.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        This work represents the first attempt to create a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> listing of the precancers, the first attempt
        to classify precancers by their biological properties and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt to create a pathologic classification of
        the precancers that recognizes fundamental biologic and
        morphologic distinctions (taxons) among the precancers. A
        draft classification, placed into the public domain, is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward a clinically useful classification of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precancers</ENAMEX>. The metadata format (XML) provides researchers
        with access to a comprehensive, organised listing that can
        be used to annotate and link precancer <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> contained in
        biomedical data sets. Public comment is welcomed.
