        Most current methods of cancer early detection, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammography</ENAMEX> or cervical cytology, are based on anatomic
        changes in tissues or morphologic changes in cells.
        Recently, various molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or
        genetic changes have been proposed for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . This has spurred many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        with long-term cohort studies to serially collect and store
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or tissue specimens. The aim is to later perform a
        nested-case control study, where specimens from subjects
        with a particular type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (cases) and specimens from
        a random sample of subjects without the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (controls)
        are tested for various molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>. Sometime this
        sort of study is called a retrospective longitudinal study
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] although retrospective longitudinal data could arise
        in other ways, as well. Unlike cross-sectional study
        designs, the markers are measured on specimens collected
        well before the onset of clinical disease in cases. This
        avoids the potential confounding effect of the target
        disease on the marker.
        For example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATBC</ENAMEX> (alpha-tocopherol,
        beta-carotene) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARET</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to placebo or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to in a long-term study to
        determine the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> mortality.
        During the course of the trial serum was serially collected
        and stored in a biorepository. In a subsequent nested
        case-control study, stored serum samples from all cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> and a random sample of controls were tested
        for prostate-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>).
        Importantly the nested case-control study of early
        detection biomarkers may be distinct from the original
        long-term study from which serum were collected. It is
        designed to answer a different question, it typically
        studies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with a different disease, and it often
        ignores the intervention in the original long-term
        study.
      
      
        Methods
        We had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> considerations in formulating appropriate
        guidelines. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we wanted to link the analysis to the
        goal of study, namely, to help decide on further study of
        the biomarker as a trigger for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> intervention. Second
        we wanted to minimize possible biases in the selection of
        cases and the controls and in the investigation of many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we wanted to extract as much information as
        possible relevant to the evaluation.
      
      
        Results
        We offer the following guidelines for the design and
        analysis of nested case-control studies of early detection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer biomarkers</ENAMEX>.
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For the clearest interpretation,
          statistics for binary markers should be based on true and
          false positive rates or predictive values based on the
          true prevalence - not odds ratios, relative risks, or
          predictive values based on the prevalence in the
          study 
        
        A promising marker should have a high degree of accuracy
        in discriminating between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who are likely to get
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> from those who are not. For a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">binary marker</ENAMEX>, which
        is either positive or negative, the basic measures of this
        type of accuracy are the true positive and false positive
        rates. Consider the hypothetical data in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1from</ENAMEX> a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nested</ENAMEX> case-control study of early detection biomarkers.
        The true positive rate (TPR), or the test sensitivity, is
        the probability the marker is positive given <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The
        false positive rate (FPR), or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - specificity, is the
        probability the marker is positive given no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> is estimated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80/100</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> is
        estimated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10/1000</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>. For a perfect test, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. There is always a tradeoff between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>, so it is meaningless to assess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> without assessing
        the other. For example, one could make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        simply by classifying every subject as positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        But this would be a poor classification rule because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> would also be 1.
        
          Guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and TPR 
        
        Because the underlying prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is so low in
        average risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, for acceptable cancer screening
        of asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> should be very small [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        . As a starting point we recommend basing guidelines for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for mammography, which, as
        discussed below, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>. A mammogram is
        analogous to a biomarker test for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> but there is extra
        information from various studies that makes it useful for
        setting guidelines.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> from mammography as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> is that, unlike biomarker measurements in nested
        case-control studies, in mammography studies there is a
        biopsy at the time of a positive test. This biopsy is the
        gold standard for determining <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> status in subjects
        with positive mammograms and is used for computing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> not possible with biomarkers in nested case-control
        studies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for mammography is the probability of a
        positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and is estimated via mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collected after following subjects not biopsied. As
        discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinsky</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , estimates ranged
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.74</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.80</NUMEX> a conservative value.
        Importantly the estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for mammography is not
        likely to be affected by overdiagnosis, which means that
        some screening-detected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> would never have caused
        medical problems during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s life [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This
        would make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biomarker</ENAMEX> appear more promising than
        actually the case. Results from the HIP screening trial of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammography</ENAMEX> and clinical self-examination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] suggest
        that if there were overdiagnosis with mammography, it would
        be relatively small. At the time of the last breast
        screening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HIP trial</ENAMEX>, there were more <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> randomized to screening than in the controls. But
        with further follow-up the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> eventually equaled the number in the screened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        which would not have occurred if there were substantial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdiagnosis</ENAMEX>.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason for using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> from mammography
        is that, based on various randomized trials with cancer
        mortality endpoint, mammography is generally considered an
        acceptable screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">modality</ENAMEX>. The implication is that a
        similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for a biomarker would lead to an
        acceptable screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">modality</ENAMEX>. For a particular biomarker,
        these target values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> from mammography may
        need modification depending on various factors. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor
        is the invasiveness of a follow-up procedure to investigate
        a positive test (e.g. needle biopsy of the prostate to
        investigate an abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX> versus laparotomy to
        investigate an abnormal CA125). The more invasive the
        follow-up procedure, the lower the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> must be to gain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> in practice. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> factor is additional
        work-up prior to a biopsy. If a positive biomarker is
        unlikely to trigger additional diagnostic work-ups prior to
        biopsy, a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> might be acceptable.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> caveat when using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FPR</ENAMEX> from mammography is to be
        careful as to its definition. The restricted definition is
        the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammography</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The less restricted
        definition is the probability of a suspicious mammogram
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">warranting</ENAMEX> additional diagnostic follow-up of any type in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Typically nested-case control studies
        of early detection biomarkers do not provide information on
        additional diagnostic follow-up. Therefore they cannot be
        used to estimate a less restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> involving diagnostic
        follow-up. However, because nested case-control biomarker
        studies provide data on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis, they can be used
        to estimate a more restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> based on unnecessary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX>. Therefore the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> is based on the more
        restricted definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> in mammography. For
        mammography the more restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> is estimated by the
        fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> screened by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammography</ENAMEX> who received a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> in which no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> was detected. As discussed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinsky</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        studies ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.005</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.013</NUMEX> with a middle value of
        around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.010</NUMEX>.
        
          Inappropriateness of odds ratio and
          relative risk 
        
        When evaluating binary early detection markers, it is
        inappropriate to report an odds ratio or relative risk, as
        is common in epidemiology or clinical trials. Because an
        odds ratio or relative risk is a single number, it does not
        capture the tradeoff between correctly classifying cancer
        and incorrectly classifying non-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Also the odds
        ratio or relative risk can lead to an overoptimistic
        impression of the performance of an early detection test if
        the interpretation is based on experience in epidemiology
        or clinical trials. In the latter settings an odds ratio of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is often considered large. Much larger odds ratio are
        needed from early detection tests for useful application in
        the screening setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . For example, for the target
        values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>, the odds ratio equals
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR ×</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-FPR</ENAMEX>)/ ((<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-TPR</ENAMEX>) × FPR) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">396</NUMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
          Appropriate computation of predictive
          values 
        
        It is sometimes useful to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> to compute
        the predictive value negative (PVN), the probability of no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> if the marker is negative, and the predictive value
        positive (PVP), the probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> if the marker is
        positive. For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> that is most
        important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in clinical decision-making.
        Because the likelihood of any individual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer type</ENAMEX> in an
        asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is nearly always very low, a negative
        early detection test usually adds little information to the
        clinical impression. The computation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVN</ENAMEX> and PVP
        depend on the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> as well as on the FPR
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>, as shown below,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> = (TPR × prevalence) / (TPR × prevalence + FPR
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-prevalence</ENAMEX>))
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVN</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-FPR</ENAMEX>) × (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-prevalence</ENAMEX>) / ((<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-TPR</ENAMEX>) × prevalence +
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-FPR</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-prevalence</ENAMEX>))
        When the prevalence is small, as with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening,
        a small absolute change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>, but not TPR, can have a
        large impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX>. It is erroneous to directly
        compute the prevalence from data in the nested case-control
        study, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, because the ratio of cases to
        controls in the study is not the same as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        For example suppose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>, and prevalence =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.003</NUMEX>. We obtain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> = = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.8 × .003</NUMEX>) /(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.8</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.003</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01 .997</NUMEX>)= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVN</ENAMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.99 × .997</NUMEX>) / (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.003</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.99</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.997</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.999</NUMEX>
        If we had incorrectly substituted the apparent
        prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1of 100/1100</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.091</NUMEX>, we would have
        incorrectly computed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.89</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVN</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.980</NUMEX>. For this
        reason, calculation and reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVN</ENAMEX> using only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a nested case-control study is not useful or
        appropriate.
        
          Extension to ordered categories via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX>
          curves 
        
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> for the early detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> can be
        reported as ordered categories. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, such as
        sputum cytology, inherently involve ordered categories,
        such as no evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, slight atypia, moderate
        atypia, severe atypia, and frank <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Other markers,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>, involve a continuous measure for which higher
        values indicate a greater probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Dividing
        these continuous measures into ranges (either based on
        predetermined values or percentiles) gives ordered
        categories.
        With ordered categories, the statistics should still be
        based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>. Each ordered category is a possible
        cutpoint, where values equal to or higher than the cutpoint
        are called positive and values lower than the cutpoint are
        called negative. For each cutpoint, one can compute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and generate a receiver-operating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristic</ENAMEX> (ROC) curve, which is a plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> for the various pairs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . (See Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        higher and farther left the points on the ROC curve the
        better the test performance. As mentioned previously,
        acceptable cancer screening requires very small false
        positive rates. Therefore, for evaluating cancer
        biomarkers, we are only interested in the leftmost sliver
        of the ROC curve in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. To avoid overdiagnosis bias, cases
          should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than
          on screening 
        
        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> in the biomarker study to reflect the true
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>, cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms
        rather than on screening. For example in the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATBC</ENAMEX> trial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , cases were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> diagnosed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> as a result of symptoms. If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> cases were detected as the result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, say with ultrasound, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> could be
        artificially elevated if there were overdiagnosis, as
        previously discussed.
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. To minimized selection bias, the
          spectrum of control conditions should be the same in
          study and target screening populations 
        
        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> in the nested case-control study to reflect
        the true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> in the target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the spectrum of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> conditions should be the same as in the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. By control conditions, we mean characteristics
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, such as the presence of other diseases
        or certain known risk factors that could elevate the false
        positive rate.
        The spectrum of conditions could differ considerably if
        the retrospective biomarker study were embedded in a
        randomized trial with strict eligibility requirements. For
        example, consider a biomarker for the early detection of
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> where the data comes from a biorepository
        arising from a randomized trial of healthy subjects. It
        would be inappropriate to apply the results to a population
        with a high prevalence of chronic obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
        bronchitis, or viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pnuemonitis</ENAMEX> because these conditions
        could increase the number of positive readings in subjects
        without lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> is very small for
        screening to be acceptable, this spectrum bias could have
        important consequences in a clinical application.
        It would not always be possible to identify all relevant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> conditions, but to the extent possible, the control
        conditions should be similar in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. To extract additional information,
          criteria for a positive test should be based on
          combinations of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> and changes in marker
          levels over time 
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from multiple markers present an opportunity to
        extract potentially valuable information not available by
        analyzing markers separately. Consider the hypothetical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. The left side corresponds to subjects
        without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and the right corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In our idealized circumstance, markers A and B are
        independent for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and are perfectly
        correlated for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The indicated region
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B = 2</ENAMEX> or B = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> designates a positive
        test that has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.04</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>. Suppose that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> A and marker B were evaluated separately. The
        indicated region corresponding to A only, namely A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 3</ENAMEX> and the indicated region corresponding to B only,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">namely B = 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B = 3</ENAMEX>, each designates a positive test
        that has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>=. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>. Thus, in this particular
        example, the combination of markers leads to a much better
        test than the separate markers, with a smaller FPR (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.04</NUMEX>
        versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.20</NUMEX>) for the same TPR of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>. One could create a
        similar example with any number of marker levels. For an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> test in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the region would
        encompass all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> but no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        A real application of how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker</ENAMEX> combinations provide
        extra information comes from a recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mok et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CA125</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prostasin</ENAMEX> as markers for ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Although the data are not from a nested case-control study
        and have not been validated in subsequent studies, they are
        useful for illustration. Based on Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mok et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] with approximate values for the outpoints, we
        investigated regions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>. The combination for a
        positive test of CA 125 greater than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>/ml
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prostasin</ENAMEX> greater than or equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μg/ml</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.92</NUMEX>. Evaluating CA <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> alone, the criterion
        for a positive test of CA 125 greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX> had
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.78</NUMEX>. Evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prostasin</ENAMEX> alone, the
        criterion for a positive test of Prostasin greater than 15
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">μg/ml</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">02</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>=. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>. Thus, in this real
        example, the combination of markers led to a better test
        than the separate markers, with a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.92</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.78</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.32</NUMEX>) for the same FPR of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>.
        To more generally compare performance of a combination
        of markers with a single marker, we need to compare ROC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX>. Creating an ROC curve from a combination of markers
        is different from creating an ROC curve from a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>. With a combination of markers, the number of
        possible regions, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>, for calling a marker
        positive is extremely large. Some choices of regions
        correspond to AND rules, for example A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B>1</ENAMEX>, as
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>. Some choices of regions correspond to OR
        rules, for example A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>2</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B>2</ENAMEX>. Other choices are also
        possible, but for biological reasons, one would usually
        require all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> to be contiguous. A plot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> would lead to a cloud of points, rather
        than the smooth curve in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. To create the best ROC
        curve, one should select those points that are highest and
        farthest to the left, which is generally all that would
        need to be presented and only for small false positive
        rates. For complicated situations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] proposed an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to select the regions creating the best ROC curve
        without the need to enumerate all the regions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathematically</ENAMEX>, in any sample of data, the best ROC curve
        for a combination of markers must be as good or better than
        the ROC curve for any of the markers evaluated separately.
        The reason is that the set of possible regions for calling
        a combination of markers positive includes as a special
        case the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> for calling any single marker
        positive.
        Alternative approaches that do not directly optimize the
        ROC curve include linear logistic regression or linear
        discriminant analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , which choose regions based
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linear</ENAMEX> combinations of the markers, and neural networks
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , which choose regions in a very complicated
        nonlinear manner. Due to the potential for overfitting (to
        follow), it is not possible to make a blanket statement as
        to which approach for choosing regions is best. If one
        takes the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> for calling a combination positive
        that gives a good ROC curve in a random sample of data, it
        may give a poor ROC curve in another random sample of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, simply due to selecting chance patterns in the first
        sample. As discussed in the section on overfitting, this
        motivates splitting the data into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> random samples,
        training and test, and using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> from the training
        sample to compute the definitive ROC curve based on data in
        the test sample.
        Changes in marker values over time also provide
        potentially valuable information not available when
        examining markers at a single time point. With marker
        measurements at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different times per subject (and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same interval between times), a common
        summary measure is the slope. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> believe that
        both slope and baseline level predict <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, the
        combination can be evaluated using the previously discussed
        methods for evaluating multiple markers, namely, treating
        baseline level and slope as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> "separate" markers. With
        measurements at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> times per subject,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> may identify a more complicated feature, such
        as whether or not there is a sudden increase in marker
        levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        When biomarker measurements occur at regular time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (and allowing different numbers of measurements
        for each subject), one can estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> by using a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> in reverse time, as described by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tockman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] for the analysis of precancerous
        lesions for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>.
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. To avoid overfitting, the criteria for
          a positive marker combination developed in a training
          sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from
          the same study and, if possible, a validation sample from
          another study. 
        
        With a single marker and a large number of subjects,
        there is usually no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with overfitting. However with
        many combinations of markers, overfitting could invalidate
        results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overfitting</ENAMEX> is often associated with step-wise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] but it can occur in other
        situations as well. Overfitting of a larger number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> to a relatively small number of subjects produces a
        model that is overly sensitive to chance fluctuations in
        the data. As a simple example, overfitting occurs when a
        sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> reports that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> had a very
        high batting average against left-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ballpark X</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX>. This average is not very
        reliable for future predictions because the particular set
        of factors, left-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> and ballpark <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, were
        selected to give a high average. In reality the high
        average is more likely the result of chance factors that
        coincided with left handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> at ballpark <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> during
        that particular month. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to adjust for overfitting is
        to apply the factors in another sample not used for initial
        reporting. The first sample is known as the training
        sample, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sample is known as the test sample.
        For example, the prediction of the average against left
        handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> in the ballpark <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> could be tested on data
        from a different month. Similarly, a standard statistical
        approach to adjust for overfitting is to randomly split the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> into a training and test samples. This is called the
        split-sample approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Promising marker</ENAMEX> combinations are
        identified in the training sample, but more reliable FPR
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> measurements are made in the test sample because it
        involves different data. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] used the split-sample
        approach to evaluate the performance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> markers for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>.
        More sophisticated adjustments for overfitting include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-validation</ENAMEX> and bootstrapping. Suppose the interest
        lies in a single statistic, such as the area under the part
        of the ROC curve corresponding to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>. In a typical
        cross-validation analysis (i) the data are randomly split
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> samples each with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the data, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) one of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is deleted, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the statistic is computed by
        applying the classification rule recalculated from the
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the sample to the deleted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> sample and
        (iv) an average is taken of the statistic over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all ten</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Although one could use a different
        fraction than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> computation it is not possible with
        the most extreme version of cross-validation that involves
        leaving out one subject at a time. With bootstrapping, (i)
        the entire data set is resampled with replacement many
        times, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) on each resampling the statistics is computed,
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the statistics from each resampling are combined
        in a special way [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In a recent study comparing these
        adjustments with other types of statistics in a different
        setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steyerberg et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] found that the
        split-sample approach tended to underestimate performance,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cross-validation</ENAMEX> performed poorly on some statistics that
        were not normally distributed, and bootstrapping performed
        best overall. For our purposes of estimating an entire ROC
        curve rather than a summary statistic, more research is
        needed for cross-validation and bootstrapping, as it is not
        clear how best to combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves over different
        samples.
        Regardless of the method used to adjust for overfitting
        in forming a classification rule, to obtain the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliable FPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> measurements, the classification rule
        should ideally be evaluated in a 
        validation sample from a 
        different study, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        .
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. To identify biomarkers with true and
          false positive rates similar to mammography, the
          training, test, and validation samples should each
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 110</NUMEX> randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (as based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> for mammography) 
        
        The sample size is based on the need to determine if the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomarker</ENAMEX> is sufficiently promising for investigation as a
        trigger for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> intervention in a future trial. As
        discussed previously, based on considerations from
        mammography, our target values are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>.
        In most situations, we think it would be of interest to
        specify a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.70</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.90</NUMEX>).
        Using a normal approximation the target standard error is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately .05</NUMEX>. Setting the standard error of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> ×
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-TPR</ENAMEX>) / (square root of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>), equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX> and solving for
        the sample size n, we obtain n= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>, which we round up to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>. In addition we think that in most situations the
        largest reasonable value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.03</NUMEX> which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        times the number of false positives as with mammography
        screening. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX> is so small, we do not use a normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX>. We specify a sample size of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>, so that
        under the binomial distribution with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPR</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>, the upper
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> bound equals <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.03 × 110</NUMEX>. Strictly, these sample sizes
        apply only after a single criterion for a positive test has
        been identified. For a training sample, one might consider
        larger sample sizes.
      
      
        Conclusion
        A major advantage of nested case-control studies for
        early detection biomarkers is that they can be done quickly
        if serum from a long-term study has been stored in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biorepository</ENAMEX>. Importantly the retrospective aspect does
        not compromise the validity. There are none of the usual
        problems with retrospective studies such as recall bias.
        Thus we anticipate that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>, there will be
        many reports in literature from studies of this design.
        These guidelines should greatly help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        design and analyze nested case-control studies for early
        detection biomarkers and help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the literature to
        interpret them. It bears emphasis that these studies do not
        prove clinical efficacy of the markers. Rather, they
        suggest which markers or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker</ENAMEX> combinations are the most
        promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for further study as a trigger for
        early intervention in definitive trials with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-mortality endpoints.
