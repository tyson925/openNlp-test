        The genome of higher eukaryotes codes for most of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> through short coding sequences (exons) interrupted
        by non-coding sequences (introns). These intervening
        sequences must be removed precisely after transcription of
        the gene, a process called splicing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splicing</ENAMEX> is carried
        out by the spliceosome, a large complex consisting of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and small nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (snRNAs) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> is dependent upon the identity of nucleotide
        sequences at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundaries. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' boundary or
        donor site of introns in most eukaryotes contains the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dinucleotide GU</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' boundary or acceptor site
        contains the dinucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>. These GU-AG motifs are merely
        parts of longer consensus sequences that span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5</TIMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. With the exception of the conserved canonical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice sites, splice site
        sequences may contain several deviations from the
        consensus. The match of a splice site to this consensus
        reflects the strength of the site. In addition, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
        conserved intronic sequence that is known to be
        functionally important in splicing is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point,
        located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-50 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dinucleotide</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point is characterised by a rather
        weak consensus sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YURAY</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of
        splicing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>' hydroxyl of an adenosine of the branch
        point attacks the phosphate at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site,
        producing a free <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5</NUMEX>' exon and a lariat intermediate. During
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hydroxyl of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon attacks the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site, yielding a ligated mRNA
        and a lariat intron.
        Now that the total human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> has been sequenced, the
        surprising outcome is that differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are not reflected by the genome complexity.
        Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> might play a role in this apparent
        discrepancy. Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> is an important mechanism
        to create protein diversity and to regulate gene expression
        in a tissue- or developmental-specific manner. To
        understand the mechanism of alternative splice site
        selection the identification of all 
        cis -acting elements that contribute
        to the efficiency with which splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are recognised
        must be taken into account. These include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the strength
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice sites, which can be calculated
        using the consensus values that were determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shapiro</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senepathy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] or by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splice Site Prediction</ENAMEX>

        more known sequences into account, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) certain sequences such as exonic splicing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancers</ENAMEX> (ESE) that can activate the use of a weak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splice</ENAMEX> site or elements such as exonic splicing silencer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (ESS) that inhibit splicing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In addition to
        these 
        cis -acting elements, exon length [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] and secondary structure have also been mentioned to play
        a role in splicing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Neurofibromatosis type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NF1</NUMEX>) is an autosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dominantly</ENAMEX> inherited disorder affecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3500</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The gene spans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> kb of genomic DNA
        and encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 13</NUMEX> kb mRNA containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> exons.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> exons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9br</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23a and 48a</TIMEX>) are known to be subjected to
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> and these isoforms were also detected
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level with isoform-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> additional alternative transcripts were
        described (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ex29-, ex30-</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ex29/30</NUMEX>- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-isoform</ENAMEX>) but no
        further analysis at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level was reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . During mutation analysis in the 
        NF1 -gene we disclosed several
        additional splice variants in which specific exons were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skipped</ENAMEX> and that were also present in fresh lymphocytes of
        non-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, albeit typically at a low level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] . Several other studies also report the existence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lowly</ENAMEX> expressed splice 
        NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX>. Some of these variants
        are more abundant when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is analysed from aged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> that was kept at a non-physiological temperature
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Starting from this initial observation,
        we were interested to determine the extent of aberrant and/
        or alternative splicing in 
        NF1 . A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
        made to identify new 
        NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice</ENAMEX> variants. We have made a
        survey of these variants and searched systematically for a
        number of factors involved in splice site selection aiming
        to explain the observed variants.

          Identification of novel NF1splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> in
          normal cells
          The entire 
          NF1 -coding region from two normal
          non-affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> was amplified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> overlapping
          segments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>-PCR according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heim</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] starting from
          fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood leukocytes</ENAMEX>. As expression of specific 
          NF1 transcripts can change due to
          environmental changes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 18</NUMEX> ] , we extracted
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> immediately after blood drawing, allowing to
          identify splice variants that are not induced by stress
          factors. Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were created and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          per fragment were lysed and reamplified with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> in order to search for the presence of minor
          splice variants. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were digested with a
          restriction enzyme and separated by electrophoresis on an
          agarose gel (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fragments, a total of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> clones out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in total showed a
          different restriction pattern. Sequence analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inserts</ENAMEX> revealed that these represented 
          NF1 transcripts with specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">insertions/deletions.</ENAMEX> Some of these resulted from cryptic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splice</ENAMEX> site usage, others were found to have deletions
          precisely at the exon boundaries ('exon skipping'), very
          few resulted from intron retention. All variants that
          were found are summarised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Transcripts
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> change per single transcript
          were also identified. Some changes were in frame (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          variants, green in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) others were out of frame (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          variants, red in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and hence would lead to a
          premature stop codon. All together, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> 
          different transcripts were
          detected. The number of abnormal sized transcripts is not
          exhaustive as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 150 colonies</NUMEX> per fragment were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analysed</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in total). The frequency of each
          clone captured is indicated between brackets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          This frequency might indicate that some 
          NF1 transcripts are more abundant
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, as compared to rarer 
          NF1 transcript variants. Some of
          these variants have been independently observed by other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ins4a-2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ΔE4b</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] ,
          NF1ΔE7 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NF1ΔE29/E30</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ΔE30</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
          NF1ΔE33 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ΔE34</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ΔE37</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] ,
          NF1ΔE43 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NF1-Δ7605-7675</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF1ΔE45</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
          . Some of these transcripts increased with time or cold
          shock [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . It has been shown that ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of 
          NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">germline</ENAMEX> mutations result in
          splicing errors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 20</NUMEX> ] . The vast majority of them are
          due to alterations outside the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG/GT</ENAMEX> acceptor
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> splice sites. Some of the splice variants
          identified in this study are identical to misspliced
          transcripts formed by the mutant allele carrying a
          specific mutation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NF1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 variants</NUMEX>, blue in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NF1-Δ2618</TIMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2850</TIMEX> transcript was
          found in a NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> carrying an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IVS16</NUMEX>+3del6 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          mutation. In this patient mutation at the splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> of
          exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> leads to the constitutively activation of the
          cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> present in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2618</TIMEX> that
          normally is used in only a minor proportion of the
          transcripts.
        
        
          Role of splice site strength in splice site
          selection
          Intensive effort has already been made to understand
          the mechanisms involved in splice site selection. Because
          we detected such a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of variants in one single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, a detailed examination of the different parameters
          that play a role in alternative splice regulation could
          be performed and compared statistically. Early splice
          site choice in mammals involves <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions across the exon, as is proposed in the exon
          definition model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berget</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Exon definition is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SR proteins</ENAMEX> bridging between the
          small nuclear ribonucloprotein (snRNP) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U1</TIMEX> at a downstream
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U2AF</NUMEX> heterodimer at the upstream
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we calculated the strength of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice sites of all constitutive and
          alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exons</ENAMEX> and of all deletions and insertions
          reported in this study. Calculations were performed using
          the 
          S plice 
          S ite 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> rediction by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> eural 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> etwork (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPNN</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruitfly</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/seq_tools/splice.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>) program
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In general, sequences that show a better match
          to the consensus sequences, indicated by a higher
          calculated score, are considered to be 'strong', as
          specificity of the splicing reaction is mediated in part
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-RNA</ENAMEX> interactions between these sequences and snRNA
          molecules. The calculated scores demonstrate that
          deletions or insertions sometimes occur at strong cryptic
          splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (e.g. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NF1-Δ2618</TIMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2850</TIMEX> variant), whereas
          in a few cases no or only a weak consensus splice site
          was found (score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.7</NUMEX>: underscored in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. NF1-Δ5701</ENAMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6946</TIMEX>). The latter might result from
          aberrant splicing or PCR artefacts.
          We wanted to examine whether an association exists
          between the observed splicing pattern and splice site
          strength. To this end, a comparison of the scores was
          made between those single exons that were spliced out in
          a fraction of the mRNA (bold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), including the
          alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exons 9br</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23a and 48a</TIMEX>, and the mean values
          for all 
          NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Skipping of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> exon probably involves other factors and
          mechanisms than those based on splice parameters alone.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> definition model is no more applicable as the
          distance would be too long to accommodate exon-bridging
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Therefore, only exons that were spliced out
          
          individually were compared to the
          mean values. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> gave the exons that can
          become skipped a significantly lower score (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.63</NUMEX>, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.03</NUMEX>) at the acceptor site, compared to the mean 
          NF1 acceptor score for all 
          NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.81</NUMEX>). No such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> could be found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>. Exon
          bridging interactions may occur less efficiently as a
          result of weak binding of splice factors at the acceptor
          site, thus modulating the splicing efficiency. This
          finding underlines the importance of the acceptor site in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splice</ENAMEX> site selection. This is in agreement with a recent
          study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] in which it was shown that mutating the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> site to a stronger site was more effective for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> intron splicing of an alternative intron, than
          strengthening the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>. Likewise, there was an
          inverse relationship found between the length of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polythimidine</ENAMEX> tract, which influences the acceptor
          strength, at the exon <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 acceptor</NUMEX> site and the proportion
          of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> deleted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> mRNA transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Our
          results indicate that acceptor splice site strength is an
          important parameter in the regulation of 
          NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splicing</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point position and strength
          Some studies have pointed to the importance of the
          branch point in alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The
          distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site
          and the base pairing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point with the U2RNA
          is important for splicing. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> points
          used in vertebrate splicing are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 10 and 50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream from the acceptor splice site. We
          have analysed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the position of the putative branch
          point sequence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the match of the putative branch
          point sequence to the loosely defined consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YURAY</ENAMEX>. We
          developed a program to calculate the strength of a branch
          point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between -50 and -10</NUMEX> upstream from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> site was examined for a branch point signal and
          the corresponding branch point score was calculated
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A relatively low score points to a suboptimal
          branch point or to a branch point situated outside the
          chosen window (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX>). Branch points located at long
          distances are also suboptimal. However, mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point
          strength (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) was not significantly lower (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.411</NUMEX>) for the exons associated with skipping.
        
        
          Role of secondary structure in splice site
          selection
          Recently, it was suggested that 
          NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> skipping events could be
          explained by structural alterations in possible higher
          free-energy structures of the pre-mRNA at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> site
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Here in, it was hypothesised that when an
          alternative structure is too different from the lowest
          free-energy structure (ground state) this sequence is not
          recognised by the splicing machinery and that, as a
          consequence, the corresponding exon becomes skipped. We
          further elaborated this hypothesis by comparing the
          lowest free energy structures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>- and acceptor
          sites of 
          all exons that were prone to
          skipping (bold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) to their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> higher
          free-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> using the mfold program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ]
          . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> showed remarkable alterations between
          both energy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, but many others did not at all. A
          representative example is given in figure 3where a
          striking structural change was found between the energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). On the other
          hand, very similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were obtained for the donor
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 4b</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C,3<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) although this exon was shown to
          be skipped in a significant part of the mRNA in several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (unpublished results) using the highly accurate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">real-time PCR</ENAMEX> technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, when the
          window is displaced over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few nucleotides</TIMEX>, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exemplified</ENAMEX> here for exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, the ground state alters
          considerably, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>), demonstrating the difficulty
          of assigning significance to these 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> results. These data
          indicate that one has to be extremely careful when
          correlating exon skipping events to secondary structure
          predictions. Limitations of the mathematical model,
          uncertainties in the thermodynamic parameters and
          influences of the secondary structure 
          in vivo by specific interactions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RNA-protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> limit the prediction capacities of
          secondary structure by these programs.
          On the other hand, comparison of the ground state of a
          mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>, as was done for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G1185</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1U</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G1185</NUMEX>+1A
          in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , to the higher energy structure of the normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donor</ENAMEX> is superfluous to explain skipping. It is well
          known that splice sites mutated at their highly conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>-GT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are not recognised anymore by the splicing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX> since recognition e.g. of the splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1snRNP</ENAMEX> is mainly directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-RNA base pairing</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The data presented in this study indicate that splicing
        in 
        NF1 is extremely complex. Although
        several alternative transcripts have been found previously
        for the 
        NF1 gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] , we
        identified multiple 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">novel NF1</ENAMEX> splice variants and made a
        survey of them. This large catalogue of variants detected
        in one single gene allowed to perform a comparative
        analysis of the factors involved in splice regulation in
        order to explain the observed variants. We performed an
        extensive analysis of different splicing parameters. These
        include the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site, the
        branch point strength and secondary structure predictions
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor site. On the basis of the
        analysed features we can conclude that an interplay of
        various factors is involved in regulation of 
        NF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splicing</ENAMEX>. Competition between the
        alternative splice sites depends on the relative quality of
        the different constitutive splice signals and we found that
        the acceptor strength probably plays a major role in this
        regulation. The functional significance of the transcripts
        identified in this study still remains unclear. What
        fraction of the splicing represents <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'noise'</ENAMEX>, caused by the
        relaxation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA splicing</ENAMEX>, is currently unknown.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted immediately after blood
        drawing, excluding as far as possible influences due to
        stress factors, some splice events occurred at
        non-consensus splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and probably represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'aberrant</ENAMEX>' splicing. However, some of these novel
        identified transcripts could potentially encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
        different sizes and may have distinct roles. Further
        research was started to analyse tissue-specific expression
        of several transcripts. Preliminary results show that some
        transcripts are highly expressed in specific tissues,
        demonstrating that splicing in 
        NF1 may be regulated in a tissue
        specific manner. Further analysis of these transcripts is
        needed and it will remain a challenging task to elucidate
        the biological significance of all of them.

          Nomenclature for the description of the different

          In order to clearly describing the identity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>) of
          the transcripts, following nomenclature was used:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">• The ID</ENAMEX> of all transcript variants start with 'NF1'

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splice</ENAMEX> site scores
          The sequence environment of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>- and acceptor
          sites was analysed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Splice Site Prediction by Neural</ENAMEX>
          Network (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPNN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URL</ENAMEX> address:

          Branch point scores
          We searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point sequences in a window of
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> with respect to the acceptor site. A program was
          written in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DELPHI</ENAMEX> to calculate the strength of a branch
          point. Every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-nucleotide sequence within the window was
          evaluated as a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point. The 'standard'
          branch point sequence weight-table [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] was used to
          assign a score at every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-nucleotide sequence within the
          window. The computed score reflects how closely it
          resembles known branch point sequences. The sequence with
          the highest score was selected as the 'putative' branch
          point.

          acceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> exons of 
          NF1 within a window of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 bp.</ENAMEX> It
          has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] that there is a window of about
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 nucleotides</TIMEX> after transcription where the pre-mRNA is
          free to fold. The size of this window would be defined by
