        Despite continuing decreases in incidence and mortality
        rates, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> of the colon and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rectum</ENAMEX> remain the third
        leading cause of cancer deaths in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        . The decline in incidence, and hence mortality, from
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> is most likely attributable to an
        increase in recommendations to perform routine screening on
        average risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and to improved screening
        techniques [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, there is ever advancing
        knowledge into the pathogenic mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
        resulting strides in the development of more efficacious
        therapies.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> it has become evident that nonsteroidal
        anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (NSAIDs) represent a potential
        class of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The utility of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, in the treatment of colon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has stemmed from studies conducted both in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Evidence
        from human studies has largely come from epidemiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> can reduce
        the relative risk of developing colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40-50%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . The utility of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> therapeutics is not limited to
        prevention strategies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> sulindac has been shown to
        cause regression of colorectal adenomas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        hereditary forms of polyposis (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Familial</ENAMEX> Adenomatous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyposis</ENAMEX> (FAP) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Syndrome</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] and in
        sporadic colorectal adenomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In addition, case
        reports have demonstrated that indomethacin and sulindac
        were effective co-therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in the treatment of
        desmoid tumours [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Finally, the inclusion either
        of indomethacin, naproxen or sulindac in the chemotherapy
        regiment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric carcinoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> resulted in a
        significant increase in survival; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> months
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> included in treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-neoplastic</ENAMEX> properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> can be
        duplicated in animal models (mainly rodent) of colon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most commonly used are the multiple
        intestinal neoplasia ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /+</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and the chemically
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">azoxymethane</NUMEX>)-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> models. In both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, NSAID
        administration has been reported to significantly attenuate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tumour</ENAMEX> number and size when provided either as a preventive
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] or treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6 11</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Min /+</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has received great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">favour</ENAMEX> because it contains a mutation in the 
        Apc gene, which is homologous to the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adenomatous polyposis coli</ENAMEX> (APC) gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Defects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">APC tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor gene are thought to
        play a role in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 70%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancers</ENAMEX>
        and is responsible for inherited syndromes of polyposis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardner's</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> the
        majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancers</ENAMEX> arise from adenomatous
        polyps [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyposis</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> differs slightly from
        the human condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polyps</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>) are generally
        localized to the small intestine in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, opposed to the colons of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAP</ENAMEX> suffers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> adenoma formation is
        thought to occur within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few weeks</TIMEX> of life, with a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> compliment of adenomas being attained by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 weeks of age</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-67 days of age</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 28</ENAMEX> ] . Following
        this time, adenoma multiplicity is thought not to change,
        however, adenoma size may still increase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 28</ENAMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are also normally found
        to develop anaemia by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days of age</TIMEX> and possess a

        .
        Aspirin most likely represents the best known and
        frequently purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . It is also the NSAID
        normally cited in epidemiological studies assessing the
        chemopreventive efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , but yet the
        utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in the treatment of 
        established colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has not
        been determined. We therefore wanted to determine if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX> is able to reduce the number and size of adenomas
        in

          Treatment protocol
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were treated for a
          period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> either with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>). Dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin correlates</ENAMEX> to previous work
          conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahmoud et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , which demonstrated
          that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mg of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> per day was chemopreventive in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspirin</ENAMEX> was initially
          dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> by final

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/mL</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> were orally administered via a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>) attached to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cc syringe. Compounds were delivered
          at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 mL/kg</ENAMEX> body weight. A diluted concentration
          was used to aid in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solubility</ENAMEX> and accuracy of drug
          administration.
          Treatment began at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84 days</TIMEX>) of age and
          concluded at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">112 days</TIMEX>) of age. Following
          completion of the treatment period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized
          with sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nembutal ®</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 mg/kg i.m.</ENAMEX>) and
          the entire gastrointestinal (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX>) tract was removed. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> tract was segregated into stomach, small intestine and
          colon, and placed into <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> phosphate buffered formalin
          for fixation. A portion of liver tissue was also obtained
          to determine cyclooxygenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>) activity.
        
        
          Assessment of polyp number and size
          Following a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> fixation period, the stomach and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> solution) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          to improve polyp contrast. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Polyp</ENAMEX> numbers were determined

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polyp</ENAMEX> diameters were
          calculated from their measured areas.
        
        
          Immunohistochemical detection of apoptosis
          Sections of formalin-fixed small intestinal tissues,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> cm in length, were rolled upon
          themselves with the mucosal surface facing outwards.
          Tissue sections were then processed and embedded in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraffin</ENAMEX> using routine histological techniques. Small
          intestinal tissue was sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> μm and immobilised
          on slides.
          Apoptotic cells were labelled 
          in situ by use of a commercially

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>.
          Detection of labelled cells was carried out via the
          conversion of diaminobenzidine (DAB) by

          large intestinal polyps (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Concurrent with the
          above findings, no significant differences were seen in
          total adenoma area or average adenoma size. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adenomas</ENAMEX> in
          the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intestine</ENAMEX> had an average diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.64</NUMEX> ±

          Vehicle-treated

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> also resulted in a significant

          Overall welfare
          The quality of life of the

          was not altered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin-</ENAMEX>treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Wild type animals
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> weighed initially <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23.6 ± 1.6 g</NUMEX> and
          gained approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.9 ± 1.9 g</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4-week</TIMEX> period.
          Vehicle- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin-</ENAMEX>treated

          respectively). Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin-</ENAMEX>treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were found to be anemic based upon hematocrit
          values (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anaemia</ENAMEX> is characteristic of the model
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Both treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> displayed hematocrit

          treatment did not improve or worsen the anaemia (table

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>) are referenced to have

          Survival rate of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 95%</NUMEX>.
          One animal had to be sacrificed prior (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>) to the
          completion of the study and was in the vehicle treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Post-mortem examination revealed a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> polyps (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> small and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> large intestinal). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          obtained from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was not included in the
          analysis. In addition, one animal was found to possess no
          small or large intestinal polyps. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> had been
          treated with a full regiment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, however, it was
          assumed not to possess the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ genotype and was therefore
          not included in data analysis. A wild type genotype was
          assumed, since no existing data suggests or indicates
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> is able to cause complete elimination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenomas</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> also possessed a
          normal hematocrit value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX> has indicated that cancer
        incidence rates are on the decline, however, they estimate
        that greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</NUMEX> new cases will be diagnosed
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Of these new cases, it is expected that
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> will comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10-11%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . With staggering numbers as these, it is not surprising
        that chemoprevention has been proposed as a viable strategy
        to fight <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Among the leading therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> prevention are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies have indicated that the
        frequent, long term use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> could reduce the
        relative risk of developing colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-50%</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 32</NUMEX> ] . Despite the wealth of information regarding
        the chemopreventive ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, information to
        indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in a therapeutic modality is
        lacking. To date no studies or case reports have examined
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAP</ENAMEX>, although
        various clinical trials are under way [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In
        accordance with the above data, studies conducted in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have always employed a prevention strategy as well
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 9</NUMEX> ] . To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to
        examine the therapeutic potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in a rodent
        model of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX>, in particular, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ murine model of polyposis. The
        study revealed that treatment of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with established
        polyposis with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> produce no appreciable
        therapeutic effect.
        While the evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Min /+</ENAMEX> model utilising a therapeutic
        regime is lacking, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> (sulindac, flurbiprofen,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">piroxicam</ENAMEX> and celecoxib) have been shown to significantly
        reduce polyp numbers when administered using similar
        protocols [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 34 35</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> recent
        reports have demonstrated a lack of effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Combined,
        these studies indicate that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Min /+</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is responsive to NSAIDs
        other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> when provided as a treatment. They also
        raise into question the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> as a
        chemotherapeutic for colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and perhaps more
        specifically, familial adenomatous polyposis.
        With the exemplary track record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> in this model
        of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, why was a lack of effect seen in this
        model? Was it a consequence of the dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and/or
        duration of treatment used? In the current study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        received approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> per day. This
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> was found by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] to be sufficient
        (significant) to reduce both polyp number and intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> (PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) content by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 45%</NUMEX> when
        provided from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-6 weeks of age to 16 weeks of age</TIMEX> (i.e.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemopreventive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] have also
        suggested that the maximal tumour suppression for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>
        may be in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> range. The above <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> followed a
        similar protocol to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahmoud et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , but employed far
        greater doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 and 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) and reported
        no dose-response relationship and a maximal suppression of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of
        azoxymethane-induced colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> has also
        only been found to inhibit aberrant crypt foci and tumour
        development by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 65%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 39</ENAMEX> ] . Coincidentally,
        epidemiological data also report reductions in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-50%</NUMEX>
        range [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 32</NUMEX> ] . However, whether this can be used
        as an argument to support the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> is only
        able to suppress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumour</ENAMEX> formation by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> is difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapolate</ENAMEX> because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different end points are being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examined</ENAMEX> (i.e., relative risk versus tumour number).
        Finally, as indicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, other studies have
        demonstrated that doses of NSAIDs other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> which
        were found to be chemopreventive were able to produce
        similar reductions in polyp numbers when used in a
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 34 35</ENAMEX> ] . Chiu 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] demonstrated that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 11 weeks</TIMEX>
        of age possessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 35-40</NUMEX> polyps and that treatment
        (starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 weeks of age</TIMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as 4 days</TIMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulindac</ENAMEX> produced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> reduction in polyp number.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gendler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] reported that
        administration of piroxicam (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ppm in diet) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-13</NUMEX> week
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or more days
        resulted in maximal tumour number suppression (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>).
        Finally, 
        R -flurbiprofen (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 mg/kg/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>) orally
        administered to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /+</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 days</TIMEX> starting at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX> was also able to decrease tumour number by
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Various studies have reported increased levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostaglandins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in colorectal adenomas
        and adenocarcinomas obtained both from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . These findings have lead to the
        implication that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> plays an important role in
        intestinal neoplasia and that the anti-neoplastic effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> are attributable to their ability to inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>. In light of this information, the mechanism by which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> inhibit colorectal cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> has not been fully elucidated and cannot simply
        be equated to the suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiff</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rigas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> may to affect colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> development via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-mediated carcinogen activation</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cell
        proliferation, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) apoptosis and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) immune surveillance.
        Within these potential mechanisms exists the possibility
        for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-dependent</ENAMEX> and -independent mechanisms. In the
        current study we also examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>-activity and apoptosis.
        The treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> employed was sufficient to attenuate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> activity by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> and increased the number of apoptotic
        bodies within tumours by greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold. Similar
        findings were reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] using an equivalent
        dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in a prevention strategy. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        demonstrated a ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in small intestinal tumour
        number and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> content and a ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. Contrary to the similarities seen in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-inhibition</ENAMEX> and increased apoptosis, the present study
        saw no effect on tumour number or size. The discordant
        effect seen between the current study and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] are difficult to
        explain. The duration and timing of treatment (i.e.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevention</ENAMEX> vs. treatment) would seem the most likely
        explanation. This possibility has also been eluded in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians' Health Study</ENAMEX> found
        no significant reduction in the relative risk of developing
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> consuming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325</NUMEX> mg of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX> reported that a significant decrease in risk
        was only seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> on a regular basis
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 or more years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Whether this simple
        explanation accounts for the difference in results reported
        here and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] does not seem likely.
        As stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> previous studies employing
        prevention strategies and higher doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> also
        found no effect on tumour burden [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Perhaps a
        similar discordant effect will appear in human studies as
        results are released from the currently ongoing clinical
        trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . If such a situation does arise, it could
        indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> might not be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> of choice for
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> therapy. In contrast, to date no
        conflicting data have been published regarding the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulindac</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulindac</ENAMEX> has been shown to be efficacious both in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rodent</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAP</ENAMEX> and in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Although no change was seen in tumour number or size,
        the significant increase seen in apoptosis might imply that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX> could still hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in treating colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The present study would suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> has
        little or no use as a stand-alone therapy, but could
        present a viable option in combination chemotherapy. Recent
        reports by Torrance 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] demonstrate that
        combinatorial therapy comprised of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> inhibitor and
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor inhibitors</ENAMEX> resulted in synergistic
        anti-tumour activity. In fact, the study conducted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that doses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulindac</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) found to be ineffective as stand-alone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Min/+</ENAMEX> model became extremely potent
        when combined with an epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> receptor
        kinase inhibitor. The combination therapy was able to
        completely abolish all macroscopically visible tumours in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . This could prove to be
        very advantageous since it may allow for lower doses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> to be used, thereby limiting the adverse effects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with long term NSAID use. Pursuing future
        research into the combinatorial
        chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> may
        be of greater value than trying to account for the
        discordant effect.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Despite abundant evidence from epidemiological, clinical
        and animal studies regarding the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX> as a chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        the current study found no change in tumour burden in the
        extensively used 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Min /</ENAMEX>+ murine model of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        The findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> was still able to significantly
        increase the number of apoptotic cells within tumours and
        lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> levels suggests that it may be better
        suited to combinatorial therapy, but its utility as a
        stand-alone modality in established <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GI cancer</ENAMEX> is
        questionable. Promising results have already been attained
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX inhibitors</ENAMEX> as co-therapies in
        the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> and present a valuable
        future research direction.
