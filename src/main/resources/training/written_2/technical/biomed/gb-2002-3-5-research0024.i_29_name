        Gene fusion leading to the formation of multidomain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is one of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution.
        Gene fusions characteristically bring together proteins
        that function in a concerted manner, such as successive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> in metabolic pathways, enzymes and the domains
        involved in their regulation, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains and
        ligand-binding domains in prokaryotic transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The selective advantage of domain
        fusion lies in the increased efficiency of coupling of the
        corresponding biochemical reaction or signal transduction
        step [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and in the tight co-regulation of expression of
        the fused domains. In signal transduction systems, such as
        prokaryotic two-component <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and sugar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphotransferase</ENAMEX> (PTS) systems, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> receptor
        kinases, domain fusion is the main principle of functional
        design [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, accretion of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> appears to be one of the important routes for
        increasing functional complexity in the evolution of
        multicellular eukaryotes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        Pairs of distinct genes that are fused in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        genome have been termed fusion-linked [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. A gene fusion
        is presumably fixed during evolution only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
        cooperate functionally and, by inference, a functional link
        can be predicted to exist between fusion-linked genes.
        Recently, this simple concept has been used by several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as a means of systematic prediction of the functions
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 10, 11</ENAMEX>].
        In addition to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for functional prediction,
        analysis of gene fusions may help in addressing fundamental
        evolutionary issues. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fusions</ENAMEX> often show scattered
        phyletic patterns, appearing in several species from
        different lineages. By investigating the phylogenies of
        each of the two fusion-linked genes, it may be possible to
        determine the evolutionary scenario for the fusion itself.
        A recent study provided evidence that the fission of fused
        genes occurred during evolution at a rate comparable to
        that of fusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Here, we address another central
        aspect of the evolution of gene fusions, namely, do fusions
        of the same domains in different phylogenetic lineages
        reflect vertical descent, possibly accompanied by multiple
        lineage-specific fission events, or independent fusion
        events, or horizontal transfer of the fused gene? In other
        words, is a fusion of a given pair of genes extremely rare
        and, once formed, is it spread by horizontal gene transfer
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>) perhaps also followed by fissions in some lineages?
        Alternatively, are independent fusions of the same gene
        pair in distinct lineages relatively common during
        evolution? Among fusions that are found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary kingdoms of life (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria, Archaea</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eukaryota</ENAMEX>), we detected both modes of evolution, but
        horizontal transfer of a fused gene appeared to be more
        common than independent fusion events or vertical
        inheritance with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple fissions</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        To distinguish between a single fusion event followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> and/or fission of the fused gene and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>,
        independent fusion events in distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, we
        analyzed phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that were constructed
        separately for each of the fusion-linked domains
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>). The fusion was split into the individual
        component domains and phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were built for
        each of the corresponding orthologous sets from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> complete
        microbial genomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        methods), including both fusion components and products of
        stand-alone genes. The topologies of the resulting trees
        were compared to each other and to the topology of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> tree constructed on the basis of a
        concatenated alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, which was
        chosen as the (hypothetical) species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of the organisms
        involved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. If the fusion events either occurred
        independently of each other or were vertically inherited,
        perhaps followed by fission in some lineages, the
        distribution of the fusion components in the phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the orthologous clusters to which they belong is
        expected to mimic the distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> carrying
        the fusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX>. In contrast, if the fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> has been disseminated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, fusion components will
        form odd clusters different from those in the species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
        This could be a straightforward approach to
        reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene fusions, if
        only the topology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species trees</ENAMEX> was well resolved.
        However, this is not necessarily the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> or
        archaea, where relationships between major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX> remain
        uncertain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>], although a recent detailed analysis
        suggested some higher-level evolutionary affinities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        Because the distinction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary kingdoms
        is widely recognized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 16</TIMEX>] and is clear in the trees
        for most protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> horizontal transfers
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fused genes</ENAMEX> can be more reliably detected with the
        proposed approach. Therefore, we concentrated on the
        evolutionary histories of gene fusions that are shared by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary kingdoms.
        As the framework for this analysis, we used the database
        of clusters of orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (COGs) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>], which contains sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX> and
        domains from complete microbial genomes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> genomes at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of this analysis; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Domain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX> represented in some genomes by stand-alone versions
        of the fusion components are split in the COG database so
        that each fusion component can be assigned to a different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX>. Whenever distinct domains of a fusion protein belong
        to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>, the corresponding COGs are said to be
        fusion-linked [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. A search of the COGs database revealed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> pairs of fusion-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>. The vast majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>) of
        fusion links include fusion present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 52</NUMEX> pairs of fusion-linked COGs
        included fusions represented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> kingdoms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and for reasons discussed above, we chose these
        pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> for an evolutionary analysis of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX>.
        Figure 1shows a genome-COG matrix that reveals the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phyletic</ENAMEX> (phylogenetic) patterns of the presence or absence
        of the orthologs across the spectrum of the sequenced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> pairs of fusion-linked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COGs</ENAMEX> containing cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom fusions</ENAMEX>. When assessed
        against the topology of the tentative species tree based on
        the concatenated alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
        fusions showed a scattered distribution in phyletic
        patterns (depicted by columns in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For example,
        the fusion between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COG1788 and COG2057 (α</TIMEX> and β subunits of
        acyl-CoA: acetate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CoA transferase</ENAMEX>) is seen in the bacteria 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX>, Deinococcus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiodurans</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus halodurans</ENAMEX> , and in the
        archaea 
        Aeropyrum pernix, Thermophilus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidophilum</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the
        fusion between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COG1683 and COG3272</TIMEX> (uncharacterized,
        conserved domains) was found in the bacteria 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
        Vibrio cholerae , and in the archaeon
        
        Methanobacterium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermoautotrophicum</ENAMEX> . In each of these cases, with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX> used as a reference, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> involved are
        phylogenetically distant from each other and more so from
        the archaea, and non-fused versions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains
        exist within the same bacterial lineages and in archaea
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These observations emphasize the central
        question of this work: are the fusions between the same
        pair of domains in different species independent or are
        they best explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>?
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the pair of phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the
        fusion-linked COGs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788 and 2057</TIMEX>. In both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the fusion
        components from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. halodurans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YdiF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BH3898</ENAMEX>,
        respectively) confidently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the archaeal fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, to the exclusion of the non-fused orthologs.
        This position of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> halodurans fusion components is
        unexpected and is in contrast to the placement of the
        orthologs from other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-proteobacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, as well as non-fused paralogs from the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (AtoA/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BH2258/2259</NUMEX>, respectively) within the
        bacterial cluster. These observations strongly suggest that
        the gene for fused subunits of acyl-CoA: acetate CoA
        transferase was disseminated horizontally between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, B. halodurans , and archaea.
        The presence of non-fused paralogs in both these bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> appears to be best compatible with gene transfer
        from archaea to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the fusion of the
        pair of domains from the same COGs seen in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans seems to be an
        independent event because, in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> is in the
        middle of the bacterial cluster (Figure 2a,2b). Thus, the
        history of this pair of fusion-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> appears to
        involve horizontal transfer of the fused gene between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea (and possibly also within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">kingdoms</TIMEX>),
        as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> additional, independent fusion
        event in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains
        of phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine (FGAM) synthase, a
        purine biosynthesis enzyme. The components of this fusion,
        which is found in proteobacteria and eukaryotes, form a
        tight cluster separated by a long internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> from the
        non-fused bacterial and archaeal orthologs. This tree
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">topology</ENAMEX> suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes,
        possibly a relocation of the fused gene from the
        pro-mitochondrion to the eukaryotic nuclear genome or,
        alternatively, gene transfer from eukaryotes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacteria</ENAMEX>. An additional aspect of the evolution of
        this gene is the apparent acceleration of evolution upon
        gene fusion, which is manifest in the long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> that
        separates the proteobacterial-eukaryotic cluster from the
        rest of the bacterial and archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (Figure
        3a,3b).
        The fusion-linked COGs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1605 and 0077</TIMEX> (chorismate mutase
        and prephenate dehydratase, respectively) show a more
        complicated history, with distinct fusion events resulting
        in different domain architectures (see legend to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The presence, in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct clusters of
        fusion components and the isolated fusion in 
        Campylobacter jejuni suggest at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent fusion events, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which apparently
        were followed by horizontal dissemination of the fused gene
        (Figure 4a,4b). The single archaeal fusion, the 
        Arachaeoglobus fulgidus protein
        AF0227, belongs to one of these clusters and shows a
        strongly supported affinity with the ortholog from the
        hyperthermophilic bacterium 
        Thermotoga maritima . (Figure 4a,4b).
        Given the broad distribution of this fusion in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
        horizontal transfer of the bacterial fused gene to archaea
        is the most likely scenario.
        The pair of fusion-linked COGs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0777 and 0825</TIMEX> (α and β
        subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively) shows
        unequivocal clustering of the fusion components from
        numerous archaeal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX>, which indicates a
        prevalent role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> in the evolution of this fusion
        (Figure 5a,5b). Moreover, archaea are scattered among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, suggesting multiple HGT events. However, an
        apparent independent fusion is seen in 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Figure
        5a,5b). It could be argued that, in cases like those in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, where there is a sharp separation (a long,
        strongly supported internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>)
        between the fusion components and stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> involved needed to be reorganized, to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> COG
        consisting of fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> only and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate COGs
        consisting of stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Formally, this would
        eliminate the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> as an explanation of the tree
        topology for any of these new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>. However, this solution
        (even if attractive from the point of view of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classification</ENAMEX>) does not seem to be correct in light of the
        principle of orthology that underlies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>: it
        appears that, in both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> involved, the fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> and stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are 
        bona fide orthologs, as judged by the
        high level of sequence conservation and by the fact that,
        in the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> involved, they are the only
        versions of this key enzyme.
        The results of phylogenetic analyses of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-kingdom fusion links are summarized in Tables 2and
        3and the Additional data. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> links, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> horizontal transfer of the fused gene
        appeared to be the evolutionary mechanism by which the
        fusion entered one of the kingdoms. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 14</NUMEX>
        fusion-linked pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> show evidence of independent
        fusion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two kingdoms</TIMEX>, and in just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases, the fusion
        seems to have been inherited from the last universal common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX>. The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios were distinguished on
        the basis of the parsimony principle, that is, by counting
        the number of evolutionary events (fusions or fissions)
        that were required to produce the observed distribution of
        fusion components and stand-alone versions of the domains
        involved across the tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, it needs to
        be emphasized that we can only infer the most likely
        scenario under the assumption that the probabilities of
        fusion and fission are comparable. It cannot be ruled out
        that some of the scenarios we classify as independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX> in reality reflect the existence of an ancestral
        fused <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and subsequent multiple, independent fissions.
        The detection of ancestral domain fusions may call for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unification</ENAMEX> of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> pairs in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX>,
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in which fission occurred represented by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Examination of the genomic context of the genes that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encode</ENAMEX> stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> of the fusion components
        showed that, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> cases, these genes were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposed</ENAMEX> in some, and in certain cases, many prokaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This suggests that evolution of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fusions</ENAMEX> often, if not always, passes through an
        intermediate stage of juxtaposed and co-regulated, but
        still distinct, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within known or predicted operons. In
        addition, some of the juxtaposed gene pairs might have
        evolved by fission of a fused gene.
        The results of the present analysis point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> as a
        major route of cross-kingdom dissemination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fused genes</ENAMEX>.
        Horizontal transfer might be even more prominent in the
        evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fused genes</ENAMEX> within the bacterial and archaeal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kingdoms</ENAMEX>. This notion is supported by the topologies of
        some of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> analyzed, which show
        unexpected clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX> from different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX> (note, for example, the grouping of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans with 
        P. aeruginosa in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Massive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> between archaea and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, particularly
        hyperthermophiles, has been suggested by genome comparisons
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>]. However, proving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HGT</ENAMEX> in each
        individual case is difficult, and the significance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-kingdom HGT</ENAMEX> has been disputed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]. With gene
        fusions, the existence of a derived shared character
        (fusion) supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clades</ENAMEX> formed by fusion components
        and the concordance of the independently built <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for
        each of the fusion components make a solid case for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>.
        The apparent independent fusion of the same pair of
        genes (or, more precisely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>) on
        multiple occasions during evolution might seem unlikely.
        However, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth to one-third</NUMEX> of the gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX> shared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kingdoms</ENAMEX> might have evolved
        through such independent events, and probable additional
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fusions</ENAMEX> were noted among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. This could
        be due to the extensive genome rearrangement characteristic
        of the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>], and to the
        selective value of these particular fusions, which tend to
        get fixed once they emerge.

        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary kingdoms, were selected for phylogenetic
        analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COGs</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were excluded
        because of potential uncertainty of orthologous
        relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of such large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were generated for each analyzed COG
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were constructed by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generating
        a distance matrix using the PROTDIST program and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dayhoff PAM</ENAMEX> model for amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> and

        tree building [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX> program. The PROTDIST
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX> programs are modules of the PHYLIP software
        package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology was then optimized by

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">log-likelihoods</ENAMEX> (RELL) method with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> bootstrap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replications</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. The gene order in prokaryotic genomes
        was examined using the 'Genomic context' feature of the COG
