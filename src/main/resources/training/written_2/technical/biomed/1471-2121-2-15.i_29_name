        Wound healing involves reepithelialization, granulation
        tissue formation and contraction (reviewed in refs. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reepithelialization</ENAMEX> and granulation tissue formation in
        turn involve proliferation and migration of cells from the
        wound edge to fill the wound site. In higher vertebrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult animals</ENAMEX>, reepithelialization of a wound begins within
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after injury while granulation tissue begins to form
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> after injury. Besides fibroblasts,
        granulation tissue consists of macrophages, blood vessels,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM) produced by fibroblasts.
        Once the wound is filled with granulation tissue and
        covered with a neoepidermis, a portion of the wound
        fibroblasts transforms into myofibroblasts, which contract
        the wound to reduce and strengthen the defect.
        Myofibroblasts are rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin bundles, which establish
        cell-cell and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-matrix linkages and thus generate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> for wound contraction.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> (secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein acidic</ENAMEX> and rich in cysteine) is
        an extracellular glycoprotein expressed in elevated levels
        in actively proliferating cells and organs such as
        developing embryos and adult tissues associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remodeling</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and gut), wound healing, angiogenesis
        (reviewed in refs. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] ), and tumorigenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> belongs to a class of recently denoted matricellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are involved in cell-ECM interactions. It
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and interacts with cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> has
        been postulated to modulate cell shape [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] and cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8</NUMEX> ] , to regulate cell proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX>
        ] and migration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , and to influence matrix
        contraction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> is known to bind to
        certain growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and to modulate expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Many of these functions are
        requisite to wound repair.
        To further investigate the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> in wound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">healing</ENAMEX>, we used cells from our recently generated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . As we reported previously SPARC
        plays a role in regulating expression of growth factors,
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECM proteins</ENAMEX> and in modulating
        cell proliferation. In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX>, expression of
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î²1</ENAMEX> and type I collagen is
        down-regulated in kidney mesangial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The
        expression of cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for insulin-like growth
        factor I in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null embryonic fibroblasts is also
        diminished [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null cells have
        confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> functions in cell proliferation.
        Mesangial cells, adult skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and smooth muscle
        cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> proliferate faster than their
        respective wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing fetal
        bovine serum (FBS) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Although embryonic fibroblasts
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> grow at the same rate as the
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> when they are cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null embryonic fibroblasts exhibit down-regulated
        proliferation as compared to the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> when the
        fibroblasts are cultured in serum-free medium containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> as the sole mitogenic factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Thus, it
        appears that the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> in cell proliferation is
        cell type and environment dependent.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> is expressed in fibroblasts and
        macrophages at wound sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and functions in many
        processes important to wound repair, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> in
        wound healing in a whole animal has not yet been studied.
        Previously, studies of phenotypes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> have
        shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> develop osteopenia around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] in bones where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> is normally the
        most abundant non-collagenous glycoprotein [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phenotype thus far uncovered is in the lens where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> is normally produced by lens epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        ] and is a component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens capsule</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> show progressive cataract formation
        beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 1.5 months</TIMEX> after birth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 21</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-null lens</ENAMEX> revealed
        abnormality at the lens cell-ECM (capsule) interface with
        an intrusion of cellular processes into the basement
        membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> capsule, whereas wild-type lens
        exhibited a precise border at the cell-matrix interface [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . In the present study, we show for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> plays a role in wound repair in vivo and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>. Wound healing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> is retarded due to
        delayed granulation tissue formation. Repair of a wound in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> by dermal fibroblasts is impaired due to defect in
        cell migration.

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> indicated that the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX>
          impeded healing of skin wounds. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> after surgery a
          clear thin film of dried exudate covered the wounds in
          the wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>. Build-up of dehydrated
          wound crusts or scabs began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at day 3</TIMEX> and became
          subsequently more extensive. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> scabs
          were thicker and extravasation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, visible in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> within the scabs, was more frequent and extensive
          than that in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In control wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          loss of wound scabs began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at day 17</TIMEX> and was complete in
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) with wounds
          well-healed and epithelial covering restored (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A,
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In contrast, the scabs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>
          started to come off partially around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 14</TIMEX>, resulting in
          a scab with a gaping red wound field, which was evident
          even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Healing of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null wounds remained incomplete on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 24</TIMEX>, and
          complete healing in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 25</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Similar results were seen
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-mm</ENAMEX> circular excision wounds (not shown).
          Although the larger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mm oblong, full thickness
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excisions</ENAMEX> allowed us to observe visible differences in
          wound healing progression, the wound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were too
          fragile to be isolated for histological examination. We
          therefore made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm full thickness circular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and
          examined the gross and microscopic appearance of skin
          wounds at various time points, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> wild-type and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> at each time point. Examination of
          the gross appearance of wounds showed no apparent
          difference in healing progression between wild-type and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>, with build up of scab at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX> and loss
          of scab by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX>. However, we detected histological
          differences between wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>.
          Histology of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX> wound tissues showed that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          after wounding the epidermis at wound edges had grown
          thicker in both wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>, indicating
          that proliferation of keratinocytes had began. However,
          no granulation tissue formation was visible at this stage
          of healing in either wild-type or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>
          (results not shown). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 4 reepithelialization</TIMEX> and
          granulation tissue growth had begun as shown in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm
          biopsies in figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epidermis</ENAMEX> had begun to migrate
          centrally to cover the wound edge and reepithelialization
          at this early stage of wound healing in a small biopsy
          appeared to be as efficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> as in the
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> except for the more extensive granulation
          tissue formation in the wild-type than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the granulation tissue had
          formed at the edge and base of the wound. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the granulation tissue covered the edge of the
          wound but did not extend to the base of the wound (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1B). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 6</TIMEX>, reepithelialization and granulation tissue
          formation appeared as elaborate in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> as in
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the neoepidermis and granulation
          tissue filling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two third</NUMEX> of the wound beds (not shown).
          By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX>, the wound areas in both control and mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were smaller, reflecting some degree of wound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX>, and in addition, the wounds were now closed,
          being completely covered by epidermal cells and
          underlying granulation tissue (results not shown).
          Northern analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm circular wound tissues
          isolated during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6 day</TIMEX> healing period showed similar
          patterns of cytokeratin 14 expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>
          and wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Cytokeratin 14 expression is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with proliferative epidermal keratinocytes at
          wound sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Such expression in control unwounded
          skin (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 day</TIMEX>) is, as expected, very low but increased
          appreciably by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> after wounding with peak expression
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 4</TIMEX>. Interestingly, expression of cytokeratin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated in the normal epidermis and neoepidermis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> relative to those of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), although histologically no differences in
          reepithelialization between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">null</ENAMEX> and wild-type
          wounds were apparent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±1</NUMEX>(I)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> and fibronectin transcripts, which are
          synthesized by fibroblasts of dermal granulation tissue [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , revealed that expression of both transcripts
          was delayed in the wounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> relative to
          those of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, both
          transcripts were expressed in the unwounded skin (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 day</TIMEX>)
          used as controls. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX>, the levels of the two
          transcripts decreased appreciably below the levels of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> skin followed by an increase in expression
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 2 and day 4</TIMEX>. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>,
          expression of the two transcripts remained below the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> unwounded skin at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2 and day 4</TIMEX> and did not
          begin to increase until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 4 and day 6</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Thus, we conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SPARC deficiency</ENAMEX> compromises
          granulation tissue formation that involves fibroblast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ingrowth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECM protein</ENAMEX> deposition.
        
        
          Impaired wound repair by cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null
          fibroblasts
          Granulation tissue formation after cutaneous wounding
          involves both cell proliferation and migration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          However, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes are difficult to analyze in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>. To investigate these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes, a small scrape
          wound was made across a confluent monolayer of primary
          dermal fibroblasts and the process of wound closure was
          monitored (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). In wild-type cells, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 hours</TIMEX>
          after wounding, repair of the wound was essentially
          complete with the denuded area covered with fibroblasts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In comparison, repair of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wounded SPARC-</ENAMEX>null fibroblast monolayer was retarded
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The denuded area remained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpopulated</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 to 15 hours</TIMEX>, even though cells at
          the edge of the wound showed forward movement. The first
          evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> ingrowth did not appear until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 24</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and wound repair was not complete until some time
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 31</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> after wounding. Since the
          doubling time for these dermal fibroblasts was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> (our unpublished observation), the healing in
          wild-type cells at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 hours</TIMEX> implied that wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> had extensively migrated from the edge of the
          wound into the wound site prior to the onset of cell
          proliferation. However <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null cells did not show any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> prior to the onset of cell proliferation and
          ingrowth was retarded even after the onset of cell
          proliferation. This defect in cell motility was rescued
          to the level of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> by the addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">purified SPARC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The denuded area was
          repopulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null cells by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 hours</TIMEX> in the
          presence of added <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) as
          compared to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> in its absence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, lower
          panel). The repair of wild-type fibroblasts was not
          affected by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> and was complete by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in the presence of exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B, upper
          panel) or in its absence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The
          results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> regulates wound healing
          directly through cell migration. Although the long period
          of impeded ingrowth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null cells after wounding
          already suggested defect in cell migration rather than
          cell proliferation, we determined cell migration in the
          absence of cell proliferation. Mitomycin C blocks mitosis
          and thus allows analysis of cell migration in the absence
          of cell proliferation. Treatment with mitomycin C did not
          affect the time course of wound closure of either the
          wild-type or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The wound in a
          monolayer of wild-type fibroblasts cultured in the
          absence or presence of mitomycin C healed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours</TIMEX>
          after wounding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). The wound in a monolayer of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null fibroblasts, whether cultured in the presence
          of mitomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or in its absence, remained unrepaired at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours</TIMEX>, began to show slight closure at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and
          healed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). These results confirm that
          cell migration is a key step affecting the rate of wound
          healing and that this process is impaired in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null
          cells. To further test our conclusion, we investigated
          whether cell proliferation was affected by the lack of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX>. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null fibroblasts incorporated
          3H-thymidine as efficiently as control wild-type
          fibroblasts over the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 hour</TIMEX> period studied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          These results together show that indeed cell motility,
          rather than cell proliferation, is the major factor in
          the retarded wound repair process in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null
          cells.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX>-gel contraction by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null fibroblasts
          is not compromised
          An important event during wound healing is the
          contraction of newly formed granulation tissue by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to bring together the edges of the wound [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          ] . It has been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] that fibroblasts
          incorporated in a collagen gel induce progressive
          contraction of the gel, resulting in the formation of a
          dense collagen disc of greatly reduced diameter. This
          phenomenon has been considered as an in vitro equivalent
          of the connective-tissue contraction that occurs during
          wound healing. We used this procedure to examine the
          contractile ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null fibroblasts. Gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> was measured at various time points following
          incorporation of fibroblasts in the collagen gel, and the
          area calculated and expressed as a percentage of the
          initial area. Primary dermal fibroblasts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contracted type I collagen gels as efficiently as
          primary dermal fibroblasts from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          contracting to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the initial area at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 hours</TIMEX> and to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 hours</TIMEX> after incubation of the fibroblasts in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we have shown for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that
        repair of excision wounds in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> is impaired.
        Histological examination and study of the expression
        patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> components, fibronectin and type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>, at the wound site suggested that retarded
        granulation tissue formation caused impaired wound repair.
        In vitro studies with dermal fibroblasts isolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> further showed that the ability of the
        cells to restore wounded areas was hindered and that a
        defect in cell migration, rather than cell proliferation,
        was the major cause of the delay in repopulating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">denuded</ENAMEX> area. The delayed cell migration and restoration of
        the wound site were growth factor independent as these
        defects occurred in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. Furthermore these
        defects were reversed by the addition of purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX>,
        showing that the defect in cell migration and wound healing
        was attributable to the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX>. The mechanism by
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> influences cell migration is not known. One
        possibility is that the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alteration</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> with respect to structure and/or function and thus
        contributes to a decrease in cell migration. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX>
        has been postulated to be involved in wound healing due to
        its elevated expression in fibroblasts and macrophages at
        wound sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , our results are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
        demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> indeed plays a role in wound repair
        and that it does so by promoting granulation tissue
        formation through modulation of fibroblast migration.
        In large wounds (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 mm</NUMEX>), visual examination of wounds
        showed that loss of wound scabs and restoration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidermal</ENAMEX> covering were delayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">premature</ENAMEX>, partial loss of scabs and neoepidermis,
        resulting in repeated setbacks in the reepithelialization
        process. However, similar setbacks in reepitheliallization
        were not observed in small wounds (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 mm</NUMEX>). Furthermore,
        histological examination of new epidermal cells in the
        wound bed and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis of expression of a wound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">keratinocyte marker</ENAMEX>, cytokeratin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, in the biopsied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tissues</ENAMEX> revealed that reepithelialization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was probably not compromised. It seems possible that
        reepithelialization occurs normally in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>.
        However, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> is a matricellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in
        cell-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix interaction</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 23</NUMEX> ] , cell-matrix
        interaction-related defects may exert a significant
        influence in large wounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> causing
        premature loss of a part of the scabs and of the
        neoepidermis, a pathophysiological process requiring
        repeated healing. In small wounds, the pathophysiological
        process caused by the cell-matrix interaction-related
        defects may be too small to affect reepithelialization
        significantly with the result that restoration of epidermal
        covering progresses as normally as in the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Perhaps this size-dependent wound closure may have
        contributed to the enhanced wound healing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPARC</ENAMEX>-null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> cited recently as an unpublished result [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPARC</ENAMEX> is required for migration of dermal
        fibroblasts into the wound site, it is apparently not
        essential to the motility of keratinocytes since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reepithelialization</ENAMEX> appears normal in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> in cell migration may be cell
        type-specific, which has been shown to be the case with in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Cell motility is controlled by a
        cycle of cell attachment and detachment. It is generally
        accepted that the driving force for cell movement is
        provided by the dynamic reorganization of the actin
        cytoskeleton, directing protrusion (lamellipodia and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filopodia</ENAMEX>) at the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and retraction at the
        rear [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . Although we have not examined the
        ultrastructure of the dermal fibroblasts at the edge of
        wound sites, we showed previously by electron microscopy
        that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens of SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> numerous cellular
        processes extended into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens capsule</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        . We further showed that, in contrast to the abnormal
        filopodial projections at the lens cell-ECM interface,
        cell-cell contacts between the neighboring lens epithelial
        cells and between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> epithelial and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> were
        normal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The results indicate that disassembly of
        cell-cell contacts between lens cells is not taking place,
        despite the forward movement of the lens cells into the ECM
        of the capsule. In this study, the lack of ingrowth despite
        the forward movement of cells at the edge of wounded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monolayers</ENAMEX> suggests that a similar failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null
        dermal fibroblasts to break away from its neighboring cells
        may account for the impaired cell motility observed during
        wound healing in vitro. Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        regulate cell-cell contact through tyrosine phosphorylation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adherens junction proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null dermal fibroblasts at wound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should
        not only confirm the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> in cell motility but
        also reveal how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> mediates <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cell
        interactions to promote cell motility.
        We showed in the present study that there are no overt
        differences in cell proliferation and type I collagen gel
        contraction between control and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null dermal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Wound contraction depends on migration of
        fibroblasts into the wound site where they lay down their
        own collagen-rich matrix [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Northern analysis of wound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX> showed that production of type I collagen and
        fibronectin by the null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, at the beginning of wound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">healing</ENAMEX>, was lower than that by the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Subsequently, the wound in the null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was fully invaded
        by fibroblasts and expression of type I collagen and
        fibronectin by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> was as abundant as that
        by the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Wound contraction takes place when a
        wound site is filled with fibroblasts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        it is likely that consistent with the in vitro study wound
        contraction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> is not compromised.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The delay in granulation tissue formation and healing of
        excision wounds in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>, and the defect in wound
        closure in in vitro assays indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> plays a role
        in wound healing through its effect on cell migration. Cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> is crucial not only to wound healing but also to
        a wide variety of normal or abnormal biological phenomena
        such as embryogenesis, leukocyte immigration into areas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insult</ENAMEX>, and tumor cell invasion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> and their
        cells should provide a useful system to investigate how a
        matricellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> regulates pleiotropic functions
        through cell migration and how its absence alters
        biological processes.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> and control wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> used in
          this study were generated and maintained on a mixed

          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Wound healing assays
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two- to 3-month-old</TIMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized
          intraperitoneally with avertin (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 g/kg</NUMEX> body weight).
          The hair on the back was cut and full-thickness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oblong</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mm circular wounds, including panniculus
          carnosus, were made. Wounds were neither dressed nor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sutured</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were caged individually and progression of

          Histology
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> full-thickness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm circular wounds were made on
          the back of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized mouse</ENAMEX> by a procedure similar
          to that described above. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm diameter wounds
          provided stable wound beds appropriate for collection of
          wound tissues for histological analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were

          described above. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>, unwounded dorsal skin (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 day</TIMEX>)
          was also isolated. The harvested tissues were frozen
          immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated
          using guanidine thiocyanate extraction and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g</NUMEX> of the

          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . cDNA probes used in
          hybridization were human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibronectin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±1</NUMEX>(I)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , or cytokeratin <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 cDNA</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hung Tseng</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished results). The same Northern hybridization
          filters were reprobed with glyceraldehyde-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-phosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (GAPDH) cDNA. The amounts of transcripts
          were quantified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhosphoImager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> transcript. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> independent

          Isolation of primary dermal fibroblasts
          Primary dermal fibroblasts were prepared from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 day</TIMEX>
          old newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized by cervical

          separated from large tissue fragments by gravitation
          sedimentation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature. The
          supernatant was carefully removed, and cells were
          collected by centrifugation and plated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing

          then re-plated twice to deplete from the culture the
          residual keratinocytes that do not survive re-plating in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS-DMEM</ENAMEX>. The fibroblasts were checked for their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">spindle</ENAMEX> shaped morphology (passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) and used for
          future experiments. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> fibroblast preparations were
          made from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> wild-type or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>. In all

          were rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and visualized for migration of
          cells into denuded space by a phase-contrast microscope.
          The assays were performed in triplicate in two separate
          experiments. To investigate cell motility, monolayers of
          dermal fibroblasts were prepared and wounded as described
          above. The wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monolayers</ENAMEX> were incubated at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> with or without mitomycin <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          Incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine
          Wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC-</ENAMEX>null dermal fibroblasts were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã 10 4cells/well</ENAMEX>) and
          cultured overnight in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. The cells
          were then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> and
          incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼Ci/ml</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>)

          subsequently added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and the gels were gently
          detached from the walls to float the collagen disks. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>/cell mixtures were incubated in humidified air
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> and contraction was monitored for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>. The
          assay was performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, each in triplicate. The
          area of gels was calculated from the average diameter of
