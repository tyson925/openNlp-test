        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> published [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recently presented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        ] randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial have
        unequivocally demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-Hydroxy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylgluatryl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coenzyme A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG CoA</ENAMEX>) reductase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (statins) reduce
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality associated with coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. These trials found that when compared with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>, statins significantly reduced the incidence of
        death, myocardial infarction, unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, percutaneous
        and surgical coronary revascularization, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with 
        stable coronary disease. Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to six months of</TIMEX> enrollment were excluded,
        these trials did not assess the effect of lipid-lowering
        therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with
        recently 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unstable coronary disease</ENAMEX>. Whether
        lipid-lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if
        initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome
        is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse
        cardiac events is much greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with unstable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary disease</ENAMEX> than in the stable setting. The Myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX>) trial set out to answer this question.
      
      
        The answer?
        MIRACL enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,086</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-96 hours</TIMEX> (mean
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">63 hours</TIMEX>) of admission for unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> or a non-Q-wave
        myocardial infarction and randomized them to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX> of
        atorvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg or placebo once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The major
        exclusion criteria were: total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> level greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL; Q-wave myocardial infarction on admission
        or during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous month</TIMEX>; and, coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revascularization</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> before admission, during
        the index hospitalization or anticipated following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        discharge. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of
        death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated sudden
        cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening
        symptomatic myocardial ischemia. Secondary endpoints
        included stroke, worsening <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, need for coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revascularization</ENAMEX> and change in lipid levels throughout the
        study. On average, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years of age</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65%</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and the mean
        baseline low density lipoprotein (LDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> level
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Atorvastatin</ENAMEX> treatment was associated with a
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6%</NUMEX> absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.8%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.4%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> relative risk [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        confidence interval [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.70</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.048</NUMEX>). This
        reduction was primarily driven by the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX> absolute
        reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for
        symptomatic myocardial ischemia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 0.74</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.57</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). The risk of death, nonfatal
        myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death
        were each no different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. While there
        were no significant differences in the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">worsening heart failure</ENAMEX> or need for coronary
        revascularization, atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of
        fatal or non-fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 0.50</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.045</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atorvastatin</ENAMEX> also
        significantly reduced total and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglyceride</ENAMEX> levels but did not significantly change high
        density lipoprotein (HDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX>. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, the adjusted mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dL</ENAMEX> in atorvastatin-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> but increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX>
        mg/dL among placebo-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. No serious adverse
        events occurred as the result of treatment with
        atorvastatin, although reversible liver transaminase
        elevation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times the upper limit of normal
        occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> of atorvastatin-treated versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX> of
        placebo-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACuLous</ENAMEX>
        The efficacy and safety findings from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX> were unique
        for a number of reasons. Although lipid-lowering therapy
        was associated with a significantly lower mortality when
        initiated early after an acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary syndrome</ENAMEX> in two
        large observational studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX> was the first
        randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical
        benefits in this setting. It was also the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trial to
        identify a short-term (ie, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX>) clinical
        benefit from statin therapy; in previous secondary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> trials, the benefit of statin therapy was not
        evident for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one to two years</TIMEX>. And, while clinical trial
        safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX> may be considered less glamorous, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX>'s
        most important contribution may have been that high-dose
        statin therapy was not associated with serious harm,
        despite its use in the unstable setting. Earlier secondary
        prevention statin trials had excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical
        concern that statin-mediated reductions in vascular smooth
        muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque.
        That no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment
        strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so
        remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of
        lipid-lowing therapy after coronary events.
      
      
        The not so MIRACuLous
        Despite these unique and important findings, there were
        a number of inherent study limitations worth noting. First
        and foremost, the possibility of a null treatment effect
        cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals (and
        hence marginally significant p value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.048</NUMEX>) for the
        effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint.
        Furthermore, while the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> lost to follow up
        was small, if adverse events had occurred in those treated
        with atorvastatin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) but not placebo (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), the
        overall trial results may have been neutral rather than
        positive.
        The types of events prevented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX> are also worth
        noting. While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> is an important determinant of quality of life and
        health care costs, other important endpoints were not
        significantly affected (eg, death, myocardial infarction,
        resuscitated sudden cardiac death, worsening <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>,
        need for coronary revascularization, etc). The question of
        whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events
        when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will
        require further study.
        The short duration of follow-up is also particularly
        troubling. While it is impressive that a clinical benefit
        was realized after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 16 weeks</TIMEX> of statin therapy, the
        increased risk of adverse clinical events persists
        throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> following an acute coronary syndrome.
        Without longer clinical follow up, it is not possible to
        assess the intermediate-term effect (if any) of
        atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX>. To do so would be critical in light of the lack
        of effect on these important endpoints at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX>.
        Unfortunately, no late clinical follow up is planned.
        There were also a number of limitations that may have
        hampered the study's generalizability. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was
        planned were excluded. Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who underwent
        percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or
        coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within the
        previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or six months</TIMEX> respectively were not eligible
        for inclusion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> reasoned that recurrent
        ischemic events in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were likely to result
        from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins
        would be less likely to affect these processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, a number of trials have established the
        benefits of statin therapy 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> after coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revascularization</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, a number of
        recent trials have suggested that higher risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-ST</ENAMEX> elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when
        an early invasive strategy is applied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] and it
        is not uncommon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to be treated in this fashion.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with Q-wave myocardial infarction were not
        eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins
        would not influence the development of important prognostic
        determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
        ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who develop electrocardiographic
        Q-waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients
        with myocardial infarction. While their short-term risk
        following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> discharge is lower relative to those
        with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, it is still much
        greater than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with stable coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and
        the need for secondary prevention in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
        equally important. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, despite the high risk nature of
        enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (ie, electrocardiogram [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX>] changes
        and/or other objective evidence of ischemia), the rate of
        platelet glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> inhibitor utilization was
        quite low (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1%</NUMEX>). Such therapy appears to be cost effective
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] , especially among high risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and is
        recommended under current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiology/American Heart Association</ENAMEX> guidelines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these
        findings apply to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with recent acute coronary
        syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels. The small
        difference in number of primary endpoint events between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atorvastatin</ENAMEX> and placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> make it difficult to
        dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and
        treatment effect further. Consequently, it remains
        uncertain whether one can extrapolate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX> trial
        results to those who undergo coronary revascularization
        shortly before or after a coronary event, who present with
        a Q-wave myocardial infarction, who are treated with
        platelet glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, or who have
        relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels.
      
      
        Time to change current practice
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> aforementioned cohort
        studies suggest that lipid-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> exert short-term
        clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary syndrome</ENAMEX>, this remains an open question. Even if
        these findings are not confirmed after further study, one
        could still make a compelling argument that lipid-lowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapy</ENAMEX> (barring contraindications) should be initiated
        early and universally in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who present with an acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary syndrome</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, the long-term safety and
        effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of 
        stable coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-established</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRACL</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are safe when initiated at the time of
        hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Third</ENAMEX>, the
        in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering therapy appears to
        promote greater long-term utilization of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Finally, although lipid levels may be
        unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome
        (excepting total :<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and LDL:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> ratios [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        ) the overwhelming majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> will ultimately require both pharmacologic and
        non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions to attain
        recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> targets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] ; newer
        guidelines are even more stringent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from the recently presented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Protection Study</ENAMEX>
        suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of
        baseline cholesterol level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, to withhold
        lipid-lowering therapy from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who present with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute coronary syndrome</ENAMEX> would be to accept the status quo,
        and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the
        secondary prevention setting have been dismal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ]
        .
      
      
        More <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIRACLes</ENAMEX> ahead?
        The ascertainment and quantification of any incremental
        benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute coronary syndrome</ENAMEX> will require confirmation. There
        is currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> ongoing randomized placebo-controlled
        trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this
        setting, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A-2-Z</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aggrastat</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zocor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The
        A-2-Z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment
        with simvastatin in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> following an episode of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unstable angina</ENAMEX> or a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will be randomized to
        simvastatin <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 mg</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> or placebo. Thereafter, those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with simvastatin in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase will
        receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg of simvastatin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> and those treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg of simvastatin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. The primary composite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> is the occurrence of cardiovascular death,
        non-fatal myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute coronary syndrome</ENAMEX> (ACS) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. If A-2-Z
        demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of
        adverse events during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>, it would
        suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> early after an acute coronary syndrome. If
        benefits accrue, but do so later during follow up, it would
        be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more
        aggressive vs. earlier lipid lowering therapy.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therapy</ENAMEX> (PROVE IT) trial is looking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> of an acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary syndrome</ENAMEX> and
        randomizing them to either pravastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg or
        atorvastatin <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 mg</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> will be observed
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1.5 years</TIMEX> for the occurrence of myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX> or other cardiovascular events. Unlike, MIRACL
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A-2-Z</TIMEX> trials, this study will not assess the
        efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>; rather, it will examine the role of 
        more vs. 
        less aggressive lipid-lowering in
        this setting.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, many would consider it unethical to withhold
        statins from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with established coronary disease.
        This makes it unlikely that additional placebo-controlled
