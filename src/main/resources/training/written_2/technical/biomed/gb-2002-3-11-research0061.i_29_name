        Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved protein domains</ENAMEX> that span a
        wide range of biological functions provide deep insights
        regarding the origin and evolution of complex biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, These versatile conserved domains often have
        catalytic or structural roles that can be utilized, with
        small variations, in different contexts. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-loop-containing nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphatase</ENAMEX> fold represents
        one such catalytic domain that is utilized in almost every
        conceivable biological system in all the three
        superkingdoms of life [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Folds such as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-like
        barrels, the PAS-like fold, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OB</ENAMEX> fold, the
        double-stranded β-helix, the β-propeller and
        rubredoxin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> ribbons are predominantly
        non-catalytic domains that are widely represented in
        multiple functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>, with roles such as
        small-molecule binding, nucleic-acid binding and
        interaction with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>] (see also the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CATH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">databases</ENAMEX>). Versatile globular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> appear to have emerged fairly early in evolution in
        various fold classes, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α</NUMEX>+β mixed folds,
        or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-α and all-β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folds</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 8</ENAMEX>]. Comparative genomics
        and evolutionary studies indicate that many of these
        versatile folds probably emerged in contexts related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        binding in the ancient translation system and were
        subsequently re-utilized in other biological systems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>].
        Of particular interest in this context are the small
        all-β folds that assume conformations such as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">barrels</NUMEX> or
        β-helices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have considerable
        potential for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">versatility</ENAMEX>, because they are able
        either to accommodate small molecules within cavities
        formed by the curved β-sheets or to interact with various
        larger molecules, especially nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, via
        the external surfaces of the sheets. A few ancient and
        widespread β-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folds</ENAMEX> such as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-like barrel and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OB</ENAMEX> fold appear to have colonized multiple functional niches
        early in evolution, although their earliest versions may
        have had roles related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>].
        We were interested in identifying other such functionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">versatile β</ENAMEX>-rich folds that could be traced back to the
        early stages of life's evolution. The availability of
        extensive genome sequence data and advances in structure
        determination over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> allow the successful
        application of comparative genomics, sequence and structure
        comparisons to identify any such folds that may be somewhat
        less widely represented than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OB</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-like folds.
        Here, we identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such β-barrel fold typified by the
        globular domain of the H subunit of the photosynthetic
        reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX>) from purple proteobacteria such as 
        Rhodopseudomonas viridis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>].
        The purple bacterial photosynthetic reaction center
        consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary subunits, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-L</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-M primarily bind the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> involved in
        photochemistry, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX> appears to be a key regulator
        of electron transfer between the quinones in photosynthetic
        reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. So far, homologs of the H subunit
        have only been found in photosynthetic proteobacteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>] and the carboxy-terminal globular domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H
        shows a distinct β-barrel fold that is structurally
        unrelated to other characterized β<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-barrels</NUMEX>. This raises the
        important question of the evolutionary provenance of this
        unique domain. Here we use sequence-profile analysis and
        comparative genomics to show that the β-barrel domain of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX> defines a novel, widespread superfamily of β-barrel
        domains that is represented in several bacterial, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and
        archaeal genomes. We also show that this β-barrel domain is
        found in the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein RimM</ENAMEX>, which is involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in the course of
        translation. Thus we provide evidence for an unexpected
        evolutionary connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>, translation
        and the redox reactions in photosynthesis in the form of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> functionally versatile β-barrel domain.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel domain
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunit is a membrane-spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with
          a single amino-terminal transmembrane helix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>].
          Its crystal structure reveals a cytoplasmic region
          comprising a largely non-globular segment followed by a
          β-barrel-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The entire cytoplasmic region
          has been classified as a novel β-rich fold with no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in the SCOP database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. However, we observed
          that the most carboxy-terminal part of the cytoplasmic
          region forms a distinct folding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> in the form of a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-stranded β-barrel that could define a novel
          evolutionarily conserved domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A DALI search
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] of the PDB database with this β-barrel revealed no
          specific structural relationships with other folds such
          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OB</ENAMEX> fold or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-like barrel beyond the presence
          of curved β-sheets, suggesting that it represents a
          domain with a distinct fold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          To further investigate its evolutionary relationships,
          we used the sequence of this β-barrel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 132177, residues 151-257</ENAMEX>) of 
          Rhodopseudomonas viridis in a
          PSI-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] search of the non-redundant (NR) database
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>). This search (expect value (e) threshold for
          inclusion in profile = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>) recovered, in addition to
          the orthologs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from other purple
          proteobacteria, several uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the
          cyanobacterium 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">all5315</ENAMEX> and
          alr5332, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6-10 -4</NUMEX>),
          non-photosynthetic α-proteobacteria such as 
          Mesorhizobium, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sinorhizobium</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caulobacter</ENAMEX> (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SMc00885</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">iteration 4</ENAMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-4or CAC1676</ENAMEX>, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), several other assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> like 
          Deinococcus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> (for example, YlmC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">iteration 4</ENAMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>) and several archaea with
          completely sequenced genomes. Interestingly, in addition
          to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, this search also recovered the
          ribosome-associated RimM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (for
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RimM</ENAMEX>, 
          Deinococcus radiodurans, iteration
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>). To establish the validity of these
          relationships we collected all the true positives
          detected in this search and clustered them on the basis
          of similarity, obtained diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> belonging
          to each cluster, and seeded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST searches with each
          of them. The majority of these searches recovered
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with statistically
          significant e-values. For example a search started with
          the archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Ta0943</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 10640258</ENAMEX>, whole length)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recovers RimM</ENAMEX> (from 
          Vibrio cholerae, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, e =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 -4</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> viridis, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Although some of these searches converged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prematurely</ENAMEX>, they consistently recovered true positives
          detected in the other searches with at least borderline
          statistical significance (e <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>).
          We prepared separate multiple sequence alignments of
          this region for all the major, distinct clusters of the
          proteins detected in the above searches and predicted
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for each of them. The predicted
          secondary structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] corresponded perfectly with
          that of the barrel domain of the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with this region were
          detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaea</ENAMEX> (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ta0943</TIMEX>) and
          their length of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> exactly
          corresponded to that of the β-barrel that forms a
          distinct folding unit seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunit.
          Consistent with this, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as mll3685
          from 
          Mesorhizobium loti, have
          duplications or triplications of this region, which
          indicate that the boundaries of each repeat correspond
          perfectly to the β-barrel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H.</ENAMEX> These
          observations suggest that this region indeed defines a
          novel evolutionarily mobile domain of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We named it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photosynthetic</ENAMEX> reaction center subunit H, in which it was
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observed.
          Most of the sequence conservation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel is
          centered on the hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that stabilize the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> strands of the domain. Additionally, there is a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly invariant</NUMEX> glycine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) that corresponds to
          the beginning of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and is likely to stabilize the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> β-hairpin in the structure. Beyond the conserved
          core, there is considerable variability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          in the loops, and these are likely to impart the
          specificity required for the diverse interactions of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Potential biological functions of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels
          The experimentally characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> possess diverse biological functions: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> themselves are involved in photosynthesis in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purple bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">30S ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX> and is required
          for efficient translation and processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-disruption studies in 
          Rhodobacter capsulatus indicate
          that loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunit results in disruption of
          the reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the light-harvesting complex-1
          and loss of photosynthetic growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. Biochemical
          studies have pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel of the
          purple bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX> lies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytosolic</ENAMEX> face of the
          reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and directly affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">redox</ENAMEX> processes
          during the photosynthetic reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 28</TIMEX>]. On
          photoactivation there is an electron-transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> from
          the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> - the bacteriochlorophyll molecules -
          to the primary quinone, and then to the secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX>. A glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E173</NUMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> viridis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX>) located in the
          loop between strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX> domain is in the
          vicinity of the secondary quinone of the reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
          The site-directed mutagenesis of this glutamate severely
          retards the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> electron transfers from the
          primary quinone that successively reduce the secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinone</ENAMEX> to semi-quinone and quinol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The crystal
          structure of the reaction center reveals that this acidic
          residue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel is situated close to other
          acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-L</ENAMEX> subunit, which interact
          with the quinone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Thus, the acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the
          loop between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX> could act as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the
          electrostatic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the reaction complex to potentiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transfer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple alignment</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel reveals that this glutamate, or an
          equivalent acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, is conserved in the majority
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels that are most closely related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H
          version. In addition to the purple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such
          versions are seen in the cyanobacteria, α-proteobacteria
          such as rhizobia, 
          Agrobacterium tumefaciens and 
          Brucella melitensis, and 
          Deinococcus radiodurans (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          In the case of the cyanobacteria, it is possible that
          some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain an
          equivalent acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> might associate with their very
          distinct photosynthetic reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>],
          by analogy with their purple bacterial counterparts. One
          of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          Anabaena cylindrica is exclusively
          expressed in the spore-like akinetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], though its
          actual function remains unknown. The extensive spread of
          this version of the domain in non-photosynthetic
          proteobacteria such as the rhizobia, suggest that a
          similar mechanism of regulating electron transfers may,
          perhaps, be used in regulating non-photosynthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX>-transfer reactions.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels, including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RimM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
          lack the acidic residue typical of those related to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunit and required for redox regulation. The
          crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel domain
          mediates a contact with the amino-terminal cytoplasmic
          peptide of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-M subunit and also makes contacts with
          the other structurally less ordered regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This suggests that, in
          addition to the specific electrostatic regulatory
          function, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel mediates specific interactions
          with other molecules through multiple surfaces. These
          interactions are consistent with the 'foundational role'
          postulated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the
          reaction center [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
          role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> could be a potential
          function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels that do not possess the
          features suggestive of redox regulation. Given that RimM
          specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">30S ribosomal</ENAMEX> subunit
          rather than the fully assembled ribosome, and
          participates in the maturation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>], it is possible that the carboxy-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel
          could be used to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. An acidic residue
          at the beginning of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and a patch of large and
          acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the extreme amino terminus of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel that is specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are of
          particular interest in this regard (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). On the
          basis of the structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel it can be
          predicted that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RimM</ENAMEX> these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are likely to line
          a cleft that may accommodate a peptide from an
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Other surfaces of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could interact with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, or, alternatively, interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The
          original report on the crystal structure of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photosynthetic</ENAMEX> reaction center suggested that the region
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunit
          could bind a small-molecule ligand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. While the
          structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels with a central aperture
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) makes this a tempting possibility,
          currently there is no evidence to support the possibility
          that these domains bind small-molecule ligands.
        
        
          Evolutionary history and diversification of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels
          The phyletic patterns and relationships of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels have a number of important implications,
          including some for the evolution of the photosynthetic
          reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Phylogenetic analysis and
          similarity-based clustering show that these domains
          essentially form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> large and distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> smaller clusters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H subunits
          and their close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> from cyanobacteria,
          non-photosynthetic α-proteobacteria and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans form the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. They are represented in multiple copies in
          the proteomes of most α-proteobacteria. In addition, they
          are also seen in multiple copies in the cyanobacterium 
          Anabaena, the actinomycete 
          Streptomyces coelicolor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiodurans</ENAMEX> and the euryarchaeon 
          Methanosarcina acetivorans. In this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel occurs either linked to
          amino-terminal transmembrane helices or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as</NUMEX> tandem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repeats</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to three</NUMEX> copies, or linked to another
          α-helical repetitive domain also found in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus protein YsnF</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this group contain a negatively charged
          residue in the loop between strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          that could be implicated in electrostatic regulatory
          processes, as in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H proper. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is represented in all the euryarchaeal
          genomes available to date and is additionally found in a
          few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> belonging to
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> are the stand-alone minimal version of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of these proteins
          comprises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> orthologs. These are the most
          prevalent of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and are present
          in a single copy in all bacterial proteomes available to
          date, and also in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the form of a
          chloroplast-derived version. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have an
          additional specific amino-terminal β-strand-rich domain
          with no detectable relationship to other domains.
          In addition to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, there is one
          small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> only in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and appears to
          contain more distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this group contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel, and, in most cases, one of these
          copies contains an acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the loop between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> that might be equivalent to the classic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like regulatory acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. The presence of a
          predicted amino-terminal transit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX> in the plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proteins</ENAMEX> suggests that it probably functions in the
          chloroplast, and that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may, in part, have a
          regulatory function analogous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX> subunit. The
          other small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, typified by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis protein YrrD</ENAMEX>, has
          so far been found only in the actinomycetes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is most closely related to the above-discussed
          plant-cyanobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and is ultimately a distant
          relative of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> have duplicate copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel domain
          and typically lack the acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the loop between
          strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>.
          The phyletic pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> is reminiscent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that for part of the ribosome or participate in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Likewise, the presence of the
          euryarchaeal-type solo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels in every euryarchaeal
          genome, despite the metabolic diversity of these
          euryarchaea, suggests that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> probably have a
          core cellular function. One likely possibility is that
          they function in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>, perhaps as the archaeal
          equivalents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX>. In contrast to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and their more distant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> have a phyletic distribution, mainly limited to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> or archaea with large genomes and complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>. This suggests that they were, perhaps,
          derived later in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> evolution from a version
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>. The extensive presence of
          multiple copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like versions in diverse
          α-proteobacteria suggests that this particular form, with
          the characteristic acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, was derived in their
          common ancestor. A corollary to this is that these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> probably functioned, initially, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX>-transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> in non-photosynthetic energy
          metabolism systems in the ancestral α-proteobacterium.
          They were subsequently utilized in the photosynthetic
          reaction center after a subset of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> acquired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX>. The phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> supports a close
          relationship between some of the cyanobacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the photosynthetic
          α-proteobacteria (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This implies that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> probably acquired these forms of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel through lateral transfer from the purple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and may have incorporated them as regulatory
          subunits into the organizationally distinct
          cyanobacterial photosystems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>] or into other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncharacterized electron</ENAMEX>-transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. This is
          consistent with the previously observed case of
          horizontal transfer of α-proteobacterial reaction-center
          genes, including that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX>, into the
          β-proteobacteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We show that the carboxy-terminal β-barrel domain of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> subunit of the photosynthetic reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> defines a
        novel all-β-sheet fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of which are
        widespread throughout the prokaryotic world. Homologs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC-H</ENAMEX>, with a conserved acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that has been shown
        to have a role in regulating electron transfer in the
        reduction of the secondary quinone of reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, are
        also found in non-photosynthetic α -proteobacteria,
        cyanobacteria, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans and the archaeon 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> acetivorans. It appears likely
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-H-like version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels was first
        derived in the ancestral α-proteobacteria, followed by
        dissemination into other lineages. Probably, these proteins
        originally functioned in non-photosynthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX>-transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and were subsequently incorporated
        into the photosynthetic apparatus after its emergence in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-proteobacteria</NUMEX>. In addition, this domain also appears
        to mediate specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. This is
        likely to be the principal role of versions of this domain
        present in the pan-bacterial RimM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other
        proteins widely distributed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea. A
        protein comprising only a stand-alone copy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrel is conserved in all the euryarchaeal proteomes
        available to date, and, by analogy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RimM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        is predicted to function in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>. It seems
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX>-barrels with a sporadic distribution and
        a regulatory function in energy metabolism or
        photosynthesis are likely to have been derived from more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> and ancient versions that were probably involved
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>. The identification of this domain may
        help in the exploration of hitherto unexplored facets of
        diverse biological processes such as photosynthesis, energy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The non-redundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> was searched using the BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Profile
        searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with
        either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query,
        with a profile-inclusion expectation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of
        e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, and were iterated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 35</TIMEX>].
        Before use in PSI-BLAST searches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRC</ENAMEX> domain was
        evaluated for compositional bias using the SEG program [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]. No such bias that could skew the statistics of
        sequence relationships in searches of the NR database was
        detected. Accordingly, to achieve maximum sensitivity, all
        searches were run with the compositional-bias-based
        statistics turned off [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were
        constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], followed by
        manual correction based on the PSI-BLAST results.
        Structural manipulations were carried out using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss-PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and the ribbon diagrams were
        constructed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLSCRIPT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Searches of the PDB
        database with query <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> was conducted using the
        program DALI [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Protein secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
        predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the
        program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> peptides were predicted using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIGNALP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>] and the transmembrane regions were
        predicted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPRED</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
        Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the
        maximum-likelihood, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares
        methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>]. Briefly, this involved the construction
        of a least-squares <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX> program or a
        neighbor-joining <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">NEIGHBOR program</ENAMEX> (both from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>], followed by local rearrangement
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml</ENAMEX> program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Molphy</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] to
        arrive at the maximum likelihood (ML) <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The statistical
        significance of various nodes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was assessed
        using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml RELL-BP</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> replicates.
