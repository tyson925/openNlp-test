        Axonal regeneration is limited in the central nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (CNS) following injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This regeneration
        failure appears not to be due to intrinsic limitations of
        mature neurons to grow axons but, rather, to nonpermissive
        properties of the CNS environment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. One theory is that
        white matter contains putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of axonal growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with myelin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. However, extensive axonal growth occurs 
        in vivo from neurons transplanted
        into white matter, providing that disruption of tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and glial scarring are minimized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. In
        contrast, when tissue disruption was significant and
        accompanied by glial scarring, including astrogliosis and
        the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX>), axonal growth stopped in areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX> expression.
        These studies have questioned the role of myelin-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in preventing axonal regeneration and, together
        with 
        in vitro studies showing inhibition
        of neurite growth by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21</TIMEX>], implicate the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX> at injury sites in causing regeneration
        failure.
        However, these transplantation studies involved survival
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> so that the contributions of glial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scarring</ENAMEX> and disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of cells and
        molecules that were present prior to injury (disrupted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geometry</ENAMEX>) cannot be evaluated separately. This limitation
        can be overcome by culturing neurons on cryostat sections
        where both the success and orientation of neurite growth on
        white matter have been shown to depend on the geometry of
        the underlying fiber tract [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Neurites on white matter
        are restricted to a parallel orientation, consistent with
        successful axonal growth 
        in vivo from neuronal transplants [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. Given the dependence of
        neurite growth on tissue geometry, we sought to determine
        whether disruption of this geometry is sufficient to
        inhibit neurite growth in the absence of glial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scarring</ENAMEX>.
        Adult rat spinal cord or sciatic nerve was crushed with
        forceps 
        ex vivo and immediately frozen to
        prevent additional changes within the tissue, such as glial
        scarring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallerian</ENAMEX> degeneration and formation of bands of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ¼ngner.</ENAMEX> Neurite growth on the uncrushed portions of spinal
        cord white matter or nerve was extensive and mostly
        parallel to the tract but significantly inhibited by
        crushed white matter or nerve. In contrast, neurites were
        unimpeded by crushed gray matter. These data suggest that
        disruption of CNS white matter and peripheral nerve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometry</ENAMEX> is sufficient to prevent axonal regeneration. The
        disrupted tissue elements involved in white matter may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligodendrocytes</ENAMEX> and/or myelin since neurites were not
        inhibited by crushed gray matter. Therefore, regeneration
        failure in CNS white matter may be partly due to the
        persistence of disrupted myelin. In peripheral nerves,
        acute injury may also prevent regeneration but successful
        regeneration may occur following chronic changes involving
        clearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">putative inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Histology of crushed tissue
          Crushed portions of spinal cord white matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A)
          and sciatic nerves (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D) were characterized by
          increased optical density compared with uncrushed tissue
          when viewed with phase-contrast optics. This is similar
          to the appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber tracts sectioned</ENAMEX> transversely
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. No increase in optical density was evident within
          crushed gray matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GFAP (Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) and myelin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C), which are normally aligned mostly in parallel
          with the fiber tracts, appeared to be disrupted within
          crushed white matter. Patches of increased GFAP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> could occasionally be seen within
          crushed tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) but not to the extent or
          morphology normally seen in glial scars [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 29</TIMEX>].
          Moreover, no increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was
          present within crushed white matter (data not shown). A
          line of complete tissue disruption could often be seen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midway</ENAMEX> through crushed segments of spinal cord white
          matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A,B,C).
        
        
          Neurite growth on sections of crushed spinal
          cord
          The distribution of neurons was heterogeneous on
          uncrushed spinal cord white matter but the behavior of
          neurites was independent of cell density. Therefore, for
          purposes of demonstration, the photomicrographs shown are
          generally of cases from higher density cultures. Neurite
          growth on uncrushed spinal cord white matter was
          extensive and mostly constrained to an orientation
          parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tract (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A,C). These neurites, however, were generally inhibited
          from extending onto crushed white matter. In some cases,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> terminated abruptly at the border of crushed
          white matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,C). In other cases, the neurites
          became increasingly disoriented as they approached the
          border of the crush and were closely associated with
          other neurites, appearing to use each other as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E), similar to neurites that
          occasionally extend over cross-sections of white matter [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. Neurites that extended from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurons</ENAMEX> attached
          directly to crushed white matter often grew in
          non-parallel orientations and frequently appeared to use
          each other as a substrate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). In other cases,
          neurons on crush <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> showed minimal neurite outgrowth
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E). Interestingly, neurites were generally
          unaffected by crushed gray matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>).
          The numbers of neurons that attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> white
          matter were limited and large segments of uncrushed white
          matter often contained no neurons at all, even with the
          improved culture conditions utilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurobasal</ENAMEX> medium.
          Furthermore, while neurites generally appeared to be
          inhibited by crushed white matter, this inhibition was
          not absolute as neurites occasionally crossed onto
          crushed tissue. To determine more precisely if crushed
          white matter is less permissive for neurite growth,
          quantitative comparisons were made of neurite lengths
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurons</ENAMEX> attached directly to crush <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and neurons
          attached to uncrushed regions. Since it is difficult to
          follow a single neurite from soma to growth cone in the
          case of high neuronal densities, the quantitative
          comparisons were derived from measurements of neurites
          from neurons that attached in lower densities. The mean
          length of neurites on crushed spinal cord white matter
          was significantly reduced compared with that of neurites
          on uncrushed white matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), indicating that
          regions of disrupted white matter geometry are inhibitory
          to neurite growth. To determine the effect of disrupted
          geometry on neurite orientation, quantitative comparisons
          were made of the orientations of these same neurites. The
          mean angular deviation of neurites from an orientation
          parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract on
          crush sites was significantly greater than that of
          neurites on uncrushed spinal cord white matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Moreover, the
          variance of this deviation on crushed white matter was
          significantly greater than that of neurites on uncrushed
          white matter [F(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30,37</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.788</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.0001</ENAMEX>]. This is consistent
          with the interpretation that neurites extend in a wider
          range of orientations on crushed white matter.
        
        
          Neurite growth on sections of crushed sciatic
          nerve
          The density of neurons and neurites was considerably
          greater on sections of sciatic nerve compared with that
          seen on spinal cord white matter. Similar to that on
          spinal cord white matter, neurite growth on uncrushed
          segments of sciatic nerve was extensive and oriented in
          parallel with the longitudinal axis of the nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4A,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). However, as in the case of crushed spinal cord
          white matter, neurites rarely extended onto crushed
          sciatic nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A,C,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurites</ENAMEX> approached the
          crushed tissue they often appeared to deviate from a
          parallel orientation and also appeared shorter in length
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>).
          Neurite density was quantified in relation to the
          crushed tissue by assessing the average total
          fluorescence at a range of spatial positions along the
          longitudinal axis and subtracting the fluorescence due to
          neuronal cell bodies. Differences in total plating
          density between culture experiments, culture dishes, and
          sections were normalized by dividing each value by the
          maximum fluorescence value within the same field. Using
          this quantification technique, a statistically
          significant reduction ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, comparing positions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼m on either side of crush edge) in neurite density
          was detected on crushed sciatic nerve tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A),
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">acutely</ENAMEX> crushed sciatic nerve tissue is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> to neurite growth.
          A similar quantification of neuronal density in
          relation to the crushed sciatic nerve showed that
          neuronal attachment was also significantly reduced ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) on crushed sciatic
          nerve tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). Since it is possible that the
          reduced neurite density on crushed sciatic nerve is a
          direct consequence of there being fewer neurons, a
          separate analysis was made comparing the lengths of
          neurites from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurons</ENAMEX> attached directly on crushed
          sciatic nerve with those attached on uncrushed sciatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nerve</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). Neurite length was significantly reduced
          on crushed sciatic nerve ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). To determine if the
          orientation of neurites is altered by crushed sciatic
          nerve tissue, the orientations of these neurites were
          also compared (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). The mean angular deviation of
          neurites from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal
          axis on crushed sciatic nerve was significantly greater
          than that of neurites on uncrushed sciatic nerve ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Moreover, the
          variance of the deviation on crushed nerve was
          significantly greater than that on uncrushed nerve
          [F(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65,122</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.226</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.0001</ENAMEX>], indicating a wider
          range of orientations on crushed tissue.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Central nervous system regeneration
          Spinal cord injury disrupts the anatomical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> (geometry) of the cells and molecules that
          compose fiber tracts, including myelin, and elicits glial
          scarring, including astrogliosis and increased expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. These latter factors inhibit neurite
          growth 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. The success
          of axonal growth from neurons transplanted into white
          matter appears to depend on avoiding significant
          disruption of this geometry and the upregulation of CSPGs
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. When avoided, extensive parallel axonal growth
          can occur. When disrupted, the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX> expression
          is coincident with abortive axonal growth. These
          observations have supported the argument that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX> are
          the primary cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">axonal regeneration failure</ENAMEX>.
          However, the relative contributions to abortive
          regeneration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX> upregulation and the disruption of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of cells and biochemical factors, such
          as, for example, myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, that were
          present prior to injury (disrupted geometry) cannot be
          easily assessed 
          in vivo . By the time axons
          initiate a growth response to the injury, the tissue has
          undergone considerable change, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulation</ENAMEX>. Disrupted tissue geometry may contribute to
          blocking axonal regeneration independently of glial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scarring</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPG</ENAMEX> upregulation.
          Most previous attempts to establish an organotypic
          culture model of axonal growth on CNS white matter have
          failed because it was not possible to obtain attachment
          of neurons to white matter without enzymatically altering
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] or treating with neurotrophins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>] or conditioned medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. It was recently shown
          that sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> can attach to longitudinal
          sections of CNS white matter provided that they are grown
          under optimal conditions and plated in large numbers.
          Culture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neurobasal</ENAMEX> medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] has been shown to
          optimize the survival of embryonic chick sympathetic
          neurons 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] and provides the
          necessary numbers. Consistent with the available data
          from both 
          in vivo and 
          in vitro studies, these neurons
          extend neurites in parallel on white matter and are
          inhibited from extending onto white matter from gray
          matter, indicating that these neurons are sensitive to
          the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitory</ENAMEX> and growth-orienting cues found
          in white matter.
          A limitation of tissue section culture is that it
          accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensions normally
          present 
          in vivo . However, the intent of
          this study was to examine the role of the parallel array
          of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">two-dimensional</ENAMEX> sections are longitudinal cuts through
          this three-dimensional parallel geometry. The behavior of
          growth cones on the sections cannot be assumed to be the
          same as that normally occurring in the more complex
          three-dimensional structure of the tissue in vivo.
          Nevertheless, the striking similarity to the parallel
          axonal growth within white matter observed from
          transplanted neurons 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 36</TIMEX>] makes it unlikely that the pattern of neurite
          growth in tissue section culture is due to a limitation
          in the available degrees of freedom. In fact, the
          correspondence between the orientation of neurite growth
          in this assay and that observed 
          in vivo suggests that tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> culture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> at least some of the relevant
          tissue properties and geometry. This same technique
          provides a unique opportunity to assess the response of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> to injured tissue without glial scarring. Spinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cord</ENAMEX> was removed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bilaterally</ENAMEX> crushed, and immediately
          frozen to prevent additional injury-induced changes.
          Longitudinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were then used as substrata for
          neuronal cultures.
          It was evident from phase-contrast optics, GFAP
          immunoreactivity, and myelin staining that the crush
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manipulations</ENAMEX> disrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of spinal cord
          white matter. However, as assessed by GFAP
          immunohistochemistry, there was no indication of the
          dense astrogliotic matrix characteristic of glial scars [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 29</TIMEX>]. Although patches of increased GFAP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> appeared in the crushed tissue, these
          were likely due to increased accessibility and density of
          GFAP caused by crushing. The short period of time between
          crushing the tissue and freezing (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 5 minutes</TIMEX>)
          would have prevented astrogliosis. Moreover, CSPG
          immunohistochemistry showed no increase in CSPG
          expression.
          On uncrushed white matter, neurites extended in
          parallel with the fiber tracts, as previously reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. However, crushed white matter appeared to be
          relatively non-permissive for neurite growth. Like those
          on cross-sections of white matter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurons</ENAMEX> attached
          directly on crushed white matter often extended
          non-parallel neurites or little neurite outgrowth at all.
          Moreover, neurites originating on uncrushed white matter
          were inhibited by crushed white matter. This is most like
          the situation 
          in vivo when regenerating axons
          approach an injury site. These neurites often terminated
          abruptly as they approached crushed white matter, often
          turning in non-parallel directions and appeared to use
          each other as a substrate. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of complete tissue
          disruption was often present within the injury site but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> rarely extended far enough onto the crushed
          tissue to encounter this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>.
          Earlier studies using tissue section culture, in which
          virtually no neurons attached on white matter, concluded
          that white matter is nonpermissive for neurite growth [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 6, 7, 12, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. This conclusion was premature in
          light of recent studies demonstrating that although white
          matter is less permissive for neuronal attachment than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> matter, it is highly permissive for neurite growth
          from those neurons that do attach, providing that this
          growth occurs in parallel with the fiber tract [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          This parallel constraint on neurite growth may be
          mediated by myelin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pettigrew and Crutcher</ENAMEX>, companion
          paper <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomedcentral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/1471-2202/2/9</ENAMEX>), and
          possibly, its neurite-growth inhibitory activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 8,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. Because myelin is
          organized in parallel with the fiber tract, it may
          normally permit parallel neurite growth while inhibiting
          non-parallel growth.
          This same inhibitory activity might also contribute to
          the non-permissive properties of crushed white matter. An
          injury to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a myelinated</NUMEX> tract may disrupt the parallel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of myelin, thereby contributing to a
          relatively non-permissive environment for axonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this hypothesis, neurites
          were unimpeded by crushed gray matter, exhibiting
          essentially random growth as seen on uncrushed gray
          matter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Injury</ENAMEX> may also unmask <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that are
          normally inaccessible to growing axons. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> inhibitor,
          myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), is reportedly
          expressed within, but not on outer surfaces of, myelin
          sheaths [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. An injury to white matter could presumably
          expose these factors by disrupting the sheaths. As a
          result, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axons</ENAMEX> approaching injured white matter would
          encounter disorganized myelin debris containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. In combination with disruption of the
          permissive substrates upon which axons normally grow,
          disrupted white matter could become a non-permissive
          environment due to exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Although
          factors other than myelin-associated inhibitors likely
          play a role in preventing axonal regeneration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that disrupted geometry may contribute to
          the non-permissive properties of the injured tissue.
        
        
          Peripheral nervous system regeneration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurites</ENAMEX> also extended on uncrushed segments of
          sciatic nerve. In fact, consistent with previous reports
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 12</ENAMEX>], neuronal attachment and neurite density were
          greater on sciatic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> than on CNS white
          matter. The parallel orientation of neurite growth on
          peripheral nerve has been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40, 41</TIMEX>] but
          little mention has been made of this phenomenon. Such
          growth might be due to non-permissive factors aligned in
          parallel with the nerve that constrain neurites to this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. In fact, neurite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAG</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSPGs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], are normally distributed in parallel
          within nerves. It is possible that disrupting the
          geometry of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> creates an obstacle to
          growing neurites. On the other hand, strong
          neurite-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> such as laminin, are also present in
          peripheral nerves. In fact, laminin has been shown to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-ride the inhibition of neurite growth caused by MAG
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Therefore, it is possible that the combination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> and stimulatory factors ultimately determines
          the permissiveness of the substrate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
          limitations of the in vitro approach used here is that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the proportion of such factors might not
          reflect the actual conditions obtained in vivo. Other
          changes in the tissue, such as haptotactic changes or
          lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blebbing</ENAMEX> could conceivably contribute to the
          non-permissive substrate properties obtained after crush
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and tissue section culture.
          Whatever changes are ultimately responsible, neurites
          extending on uncrushed portions of sciatic nerve, like
          those on spinal cord white matter, abruptly terminated
          upon reaching crushed portions of the tissue. Moreover,
          both neuronal attachment and neurite density on crushed
          sciatic nerve were significantly reduced compared with
          uncrushed nerve. The reduced neurite density cannot be
          attributed solely to reduced neuronal attachment. Direct
          comparisons of neurite growth on crushed and uncrushed
          sciatic nerve were made independently of differences in
          neuronal density. Consistent with the hypothesis that
          crushed sciatic nerve is less permissive for neurite
          growth, neurites were significantly shorter on crushed
          sciatic nerve than on uncrushed sciatic nerve. Neurites
          extending on crushed nerve were also significantly less
          parallel.
          That crushed sciatic nerve is relatively
          non-permissive to growing neurites may seem surprising
          since axonal regeneration normally occurs in peripheral
          nerves. However, regenerating axons do not encounter
          regions of acute injury in vivo. During the lag between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and robust growth, extensive changes occur within
          the injury site, including clearance of degeneration
          debris. In fact, these data are consistent with studies
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant Ola mice</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallerian</ENAMEX> degeneration is
          delayed and peripheral nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX> is impaired [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>]. Axonal regeneration, although normally
          successful in peripheral nerves, may be nevertheless
          dependent on degeneration of the distal nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and
          subsequent reconstruction of the normal tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometry</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        These results support a surprising hypothesis. Both
        white matter and peripheral nerves may contain inhibitory
        factors whose normal role is to constrain axons to a
        parallel orientation by preventing collateral sprouting. In
        both situations, disruption of tissue geometry would result
        in a substrate that is less navigable by growing axons.
        However, whereas in peripheral nerves the appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometry</ENAMEX> is reconstructed, in white matter, such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> apparently fails or does not succeed in
        sufficient time to permit regeneration. In addition, glial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scarring</ENAMEX> has long been suspected to contribute to the
        non-permissive environment encountered by regenerating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
        What may then distinguish white matter and peripheral
        nerves with regard to regenerative potential is the rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> and/or reconstruction of the peritraumatic
        region and distal stump. Wallerian degeneration normally
        occurs much faster in peripheral nerves than in white
        matter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47, 48</TIMEX>]. Although myelin clearance within the
        peritraumatic region of central fiber tracts begins soon
        after injury, this clearance proceeds slowly. Myelin debris
        have been reported within peritraumatic regions of white
        matter as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 52 to 60 days</TIMEX> following injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>].
        Even if myelin debris are ultimately cleared from the
        peritraumatic region, this may not be sufficient to permit
        axonal regeneration. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurons</ENAMEX> appear to possess the
        intrinsic capacity to regenerate their axons, this capacity
        may not be retained indefinitely following injury. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant Ola</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallerian</ENAMEX> degeneration is significantly
        delayed following injury to peripheral nerves but
        nevertheless occurs. However, nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX> in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> never reaches the capacity observed in injured
        nerves of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. If a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-constraint exists in white matter then degeneration of
        the distal stump must occur sufficiently within a critical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> period to allow regeneration. The slow rate of
        Wallerian degeneration and reduced restoration of white
        matter geometry following injury, compared with that in
        peripheral nerves, may be a key reason why axonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> is impaired.

          replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F12</NUMEX> medium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurons</ENAMEX> and neurite

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, acetoxymethyl

          and replaced with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F12</NUMEX> medium. The cultures
          were then visualized using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon Diaphot</ENAMEX> fluorescent
          microscope with a fluorescein filter and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4x</NUMEX> or 10x
          objective. Substrate histology was visualized using
          phase-contrast optics. Photomicrographs were captured
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mm camera. In other cases, digital images
          were captured to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Macintosh</ENAMEX> microcomputer with a

          enhanced to increase contrast.
        
        
          Quantification of the spatial distribution
          (density) of neurons and neurites
          The relative distribution of neurons and neurites over
          a longitudinal distance spanning the crushed and
          uncrushed portions in sciatic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> was assessed
          using a customized macro program written for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.60</NUMEX> software. The orientations of the longitudinal axes
          and the spatial extent of the crushed portions of the
          sciatic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> used as substrata were assessed
          using phase-contrast digital images showing the anatomy
          of the section but not the neurons and neurites within
          the field. Each field consisted of the adjacent uncrushed
          segments of nerve on either side of a crushed segment,
          which could be identified by its greater optical density
          (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). The orientation of the fiber tract was
          measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and
          measuring the angle of this line using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.60</NUMEX>
          software. A rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">contour</ENAMEX> was then drawn selecting
          the uncrushed segment of the nerve section to the left of
          the crushed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image rectangle tool.
          This contour was drawn to fit within the limits of the
          tissue section while selecting a maximum area of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> to the left of the crush. The right edge of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rectangle</ENAMEX> was drawn to coincide with the left edge of the
          crush. The procedure was then repeated for the uncrushed
          segment of nerve section to the right of the crush (in
          this case the left edge of the drawn rectangle coincided
          with the right edge of the crush). The traced
          longitudinal axis as well as both rectangular regions
          drawn over the uncrushed segments were recorded by the
          macro program.
          A fluorescence image of the same field showing only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and neurites labelled with vital dye was then
          opened and automatically rotated using a macro function
          so that the longitudinal axis of the nerve was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizontal</ENAMEX>. The image was then thresholded to optimize
          the signal (the neurites and neurons)-to-noise ratio. A
          macro function then automatically measured the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> value at each position along the longitudinal axis
          of the nerve including the crush. This value is
          proportional to the number of fluorescently-labelled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and neurites at each position. The procedure was
          then repeated after adjusting the threshold so that only
          the neuronal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> were shown.
          The following data were then computed automatically by
          the macro. The average gray values for both total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> (cell bodies + neurites) and cell bodies
          only were computed for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pixel-wide bin along the
          longitudinal axis. The macro automatically assessed the
          position of the crush given the rectangular boxes drawn
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> and one-dimensional longitudinal
          coordinates for each of the bins were assigned. Each edge
          of the crush was defined as an origin (x = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). Spatial
          locations within the crush were defined using
          negative-valued coordinates and spatial locations on
          uncrushed segments were defined using positive-valued
          coordinates. The magnitude of the coordinates defined the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, in pixels, into the crush or away from the
          crush, respectively. The macro also reported the maximum
          average gray value over all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> within each field
          for both the total fluorescence (cell bodies + neurites)
          and cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> without neurites.
          The final data were generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statview</ENAMEX> 5.0
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abacus Concepts</ENAMEX>). A measure of neurites, excluding cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX>, was computed for each bin by subtracting the cell
          bodies-only values from the total fluorescence values.
          The final measures of neurite and neuron density were
          normalized by dividing by their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maximums</ENAMEX> in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> providing, for each bin, a percentage of the
          maximum number of neurites or neurons found in the field.
          For example, if in a given optical field on a given
          tissue section, the maximum fluorescence value was found
          to be at a position <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 Î¼m</NUMEX> distal to the border of the
          crushed tissue then all fluorescence values measured
          within this field were divided by the fluorescence value
          measured at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> Î¼m position. This was intended to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for variability in plating density from culture
          to culture and section to section. The spatial
          coordinates for each bin were converted to micrometers
          using a standard. All statistical comparisons were made
          using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unpaired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-tests.
        
        
          Quantification of neurite length and
          orientation
          The orientations of the longitudinal axes and the
          spatial extent of the crushed regions were assessed using
          phase contrast optics. The orientation of the fiber tract
          was measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and
          measuring the angle of this line using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.60</NUMEX>
          software. A contour was then traced around the perimeter
          of the crushed region, as assessed by its increased
          optical density, using the polygon tool provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
          Image. Both the orientation of the longitudinal axis and
          the spatial extent of the crush were recorded by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">customized NIH</ENAMEX> Image macro.
          This image was then closed and replaced by an image of
          the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but
          not the anatomy of the section. Neurite length and
          orientation were then assessed. A neuron was included for
          analysis if its neurite did not form fascicles with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> and if it was possible to visually follow the
          entire length of the neurite. Neurite length was assessed
          by tracing the neurite using the straight-line tool in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX>. The net length, i.e. the straight-line
          distance between the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and growth cone, was
          measured in pixels and then converted to micrometers
          using a known standard. From vector arithmetic we know
          that this distance is the weighted (by segment length)
          average of the orientations of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> along
          the total length of the neurite. The macro program
          automatically determined whether the neuronal cell body
          was located within the polygon-delimited spatial extent
          of the crush and classified each neuron as being attached
          to either the crushed portion of the section or an
          uncrushed portion. Neurite orientation was recorded by
          the macro by measuring the angle of the line traced over
          the neurite.The final measure of orientation for each
          neurite, the deviation from an orientation parallel to
          the longitudinal axis of the tract, is the acute angle
          between the neurite and the longitudinal axis of the
          tract without regard to the polarity of either. This
          value ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0Â° to 90Â°</TIMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0Â°</NUMEX> indicated a neurite
          growing in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the
          underlying tract and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90Â°</NUMEX> indicated a neurite oriented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perpendicular</ENAMEX> to the tract. All statistical comparisons
          were made using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unpaired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-tests.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> immunohistochemistry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein</ENAMEX> (GFAP) was labelled in
          the same spinal cord sections on which neurons had been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were incubated with a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dish</ENAMEX> was then removed and replaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> ml of fresh
