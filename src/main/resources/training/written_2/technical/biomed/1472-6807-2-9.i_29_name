        The exact conformation of a tripeptide in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can
        be determined from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> and hydrogen bond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. The backbone conformation is captured in the
        Ramachandran angles Ï†, Ïˆ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The rotamer degrees of
        freedom fixes the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX>. A fixed tripeptide
        occurring in different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will have different side
        chain interactions, which in turn determine the range of Ï†,
        Ïˆ angles. These ranges are typically fairly wide and hence
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure prediction is limited.
        The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramachandran</ENAMEX> angles comes about from the well
        known planarity of the peptide bond. In this work we would
        like to complement this bias. We expect that C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Î²</ENAMEX> locations are more directly
        constrained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> interactions. The data was
        therefore analyzed in terms of the C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> and C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Î²</ENAMEX> locations, without the bias of the
        planarity of the peptide bond. For structure prediction, we
        need the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> interaction statistics in terms of C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> and C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Î²</ENAMEX> locations. The planarity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> bonds can be imposed as a further constraint.
        In theory there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> tripeptides and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrapeptides</ENAMEX>. With the dataset of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1220</TIMEX> polypeptide
        chain structures of high resolution <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(â‰¤ 2Â°A</ENAMEX>), an analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripeptide</ENAMEX> study is feasible and a tetrapeptide study will
        be statistically insignificant. In our representative
        protein data set, for each tripeptide "R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> " (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) we pick the corresponding
        C 
        Î±i , C 
        Î²i i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX> positions, and then compute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distances (Î±i,Î±j</ENAMEX>), (Î±i,<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²j</NUMEX>) and (Î²i,<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²j</NUMEX>) for i not equal to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j.</ENAMEX> These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> distances along with the covalent bond length
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(Î±i,Î²i</ENAMEX>) capture the entire solid structure of the
        tripeptide as embedded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This information is
        sufficient to fix a unique Ï†, Ïˆ value along with the
        position of the C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î²</ENAMEX> . The same " R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> " is picked up from different proteins
        and from different locations within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is statistically analyzed without any further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">physico-chemical</ENAMEX> bias about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. In this way, data
        about various possible conformations of a tripeptide is
        gathered and analyzed as explained in the discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
        Attempts to understand and capture structural features
        were first done as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inter residue</ENAMEX> contact statistics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ]
        involving long range interactions. Short range pairwise
        residue statistics is contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein Atlas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        . In the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] there have been
        many attempts to predict new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or peptide structures
        using small amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid subsequences</ENAMEX> or fragments of length
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 to10.</ENAMEX> In the seminal paper [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , Unger 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . analyzed hexamers and
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> structural building blocks, in which,
        each amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> has a position dependent probability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrence</ENAMEX>. Others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] classified the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> classes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycine, Proline</ENAMEX>, hydrophobic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophilic</ENAMEX>) and identified structural clusters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] used fragments with
        definite amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX>, and their structural
        variations in different known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, as potential
        templates for predicting new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. In all the
        cases they have only used the backbone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (i.e. C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î±</ENAMEX> co-ordinates only). In contrast, we
        have used the C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> and C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î²</ENAMEX> co-ordinates, which then captures a
        significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> configuration. Recently, de novo
        protein design [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19 22</NUMEX> ] is gaining
        importance and our data can also be used for this
        purpose.
      
      
        Results
        Tripeptides have been classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories:
        rigid, non-rigid and intermediate based on the relative
        structural rigidity of various distances between C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> and C 
        Î² atoms in a tripeptide. In our sample
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystallized proteins</ENAMEX>, of the possible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> tripeptides,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 7964</TIMEX> occurred. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> tripeptides, which do not occur
        in our sample, however do occur in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        sequence data. The tripeptides, which occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 5</TIMEX>
        times in our sample, were taken into consideration in our
        analysis. We found that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1294</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>) tripeptides can be
        classified as rigid, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) as non-rigid and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5731</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>. We classify rigid tripeptides as those, where
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,3</NUMEX>) distance has a fluctuation less than
        0.4Â°A and non-rigid tripeptides as those with all the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,3</NUMEX>)
        distance fluctuations greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.7Â°A</TIMEX>. After accounting
        for rigid and non-rigid, all the intermediates have at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,3</NUMEX>) distance fluctuation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 0.4 to 0.7Â°A</NUMEX>.
        The entire dataset of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7964</TIMEX> tripeptides along with all the
        12 relative average distances, standard deviations and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> is available at the URL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">au</ENAMEX>-kbc.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/research_areas/bio/projects/protein/tri.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
        A profile of this large data set can be obtained by
        studying side chain relative abundance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) and
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). To find correlation between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of tripeptides and known secondary
        structure subsequences, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9986</TIMEX> helices of sequence length â‰¥
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 4541</TIMEX> helices of sequence length â‰¥ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 9544</TIMEX> beta strands
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">length â‰¥ 3</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3120</TIMEX> beta strands of length â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 7</NUMEX> from DSMP
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] were analyzed and the results are tabulated in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The distribution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of tripeptides in
        these secondary structure elements mirrors their
        distribution in the entire dataset, occurrence being
        predominantly intermediate followed by rigid and non-rigid.
        It can be inferred that the rigid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tripeptides</ENAMEX> have no
        definite correlation with secondary structure elements.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the frequency of various amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        residues occurring in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories intermediate,
        rigid and non-rigid. In any category we have mentioned the
        relative percentage of occurrence within the same
        tripeptide category. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids Methionine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proline</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tryptophan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutamine</ENAMEX> occur predominantly in the rigid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripeptides</ENAMEX> and not as much in the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine, Proline, Tryptophan</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutamine</ENAMEX> can cause structural rigidity in a tripeptide.
        Similarly, it can be inferred that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Threonine</ENAMEX> can
        cause structural non-rigidity in a tripeptide. The amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acid Cysteine</ENAMEX> tends to be either in the rigid or in the
        non-rigid category, but rarely in the intermediate
        category. The sum of all the percentage numbers within a
        category falls a little short of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        occur at any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible positions in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripeptide</ENAMEX>. Multiple occurrences of a residue within a
        tripeptide are counted only once.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3does</ENAMEX> not reflect the absolute frequency of
        occurrence in our dataset. For example <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methionine</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tryptophan</ENAMEX> actually occur rarely. Therefore, we looked at
        those tripeptides that occur with more than the average
        frequency which is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> in our sample. This high
        frequency sample dataset again shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serine</ENAMEX> and
        Threonine are predominant amongst non-rigids, while
        Proline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alanine, Isoleucine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucine</ENAMEX> occur often
        amongst the rigids.
        The structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> of most tripeptides is shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. The fluctuating nature of tripeptides is quite
        often captured by (Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) distances. So, we chose to classify
        various structural similarities by looking at the (Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) distances alone. This was done by
        taking the (Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) mean distances in bins of 0.2Â°A
        (range being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.8Â°A</NUMEX>) and counting the number of
        tripeptides falling into each bin. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> that almost
        all the intermediate tripeptides have an (Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) distance of (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 Â± 0.7)Â°</NUMEX>A. We take
        the range to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX> as the allowed fluctuation in any
        single tripeptide is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.7Â°A</TIMEX>. The tabulated results show that
        all intermediates are broadly similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Among
        the rigid tripeptides where the maximum allowed fluctuation
        in any individual tripeptide is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4Â°A only</NUMEX>, we find that
        there are essentially two structural categories namely (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8</NUMEX>
        Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>)Â°A and (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.4 Â± 0.4)Â°</NUMEX>A. Finally the non-rigid
        tripeptides, whose fluctuations are certainly larger than
        0.7Â°A, can be thought of having essentially one
        structure.
        The frequency with which each of the tripeptides occurs
        in our sample set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.27 million tripeptides</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1220</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        In the graph (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), Series <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> indicates the
        frequency profile of all the tripeptides, Series 2 is for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, Series 3 is for rigid and Series 4 is for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-rigid</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX> of the tripeptides occur with a
        frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 6</NUMEX>. All the categories except the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-rigid</ENAMEX> do show that tripeptides that occur very
        frequently are fewer. They obey Poisson like statistics.
        Most tripeptides occur with a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. Non-rigids
        are rare and almost each non-rigid tripeptide occurs with a
        different frequency. We find in our sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> tripeptides, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6%</NUMEX> fall into the rigid category, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
        in non-rigids and the remaining in intermediate.
      
      
        Discussion
        Every tripeptide, which occurs in a particular protein
        and in a particular position, may yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. Examining the entire crystallized data will
        give the other possible conformations of the tripeptide
        structures in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. When this is statistically
        analyzed, it will give a clue to the magnitude of
        conformational fluctuations. It should be borne in mind
        that in every event, there are particular chemical bonds or
        steric hindrance, which makes the conformation
        possible.
        The data set that we studied typically has about 0.2Â°A
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> factor) uncertainty in the position of any co-ordinates
        of the atom. Consequently, most of the nearest neighbour
        distance data show a standard deviation ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to
        0.4Â°A. Next nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbour</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) data will typically have a standard
        deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4Â°A</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.7Â°A</TIMEX>. Let us say, we start with a
        rigid structure in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensions given by mutual
        distances between C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±1</NUMEX> , C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> , C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±2</NUMEX> , C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²2</NUMEX> points. We have to find the C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±3</NUMEX> and C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²3</NUMEX> co-ordinates. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> additional
        distances with corresponding standard deviations
        (fluctuations) are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1for</ENAMEX> each of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripeptides</ENAMEX>. Many of the distances are actually redundant.
        Therefore, the best distances are picked to achieve our
        goal. It can be noted that the nearest neighbour distances
        have smaller fluctuations, and to fix a point we need the
        distance of a said point from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other known points.
        This translates to saying that we should know, at least one
        next to nearest neighbour distance. We can choose from
        amongst all the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,3</NUMEX>) distances, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, which has the
        lowest fluctuation and thus fix C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±3</NUMEX> and then C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²3</NUMEX> or vice versa. This yields the
        optimum procedure for fixing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> co-ordinates
        accurately. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2we</ENAMEX> have boldfaced the significant
        range around the medians within the category. This helps us
        in demarcating those with fewer fluctuations than the
        median.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2there</ENAMEX> are occasions where R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , R 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> distances show a large standard
        deviation, greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.2Â°A</TIMEX>. These abnormalities are
        artificial fluctuations in our crystallized data sample.
        For example, in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> data, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have given
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> possible coordinate information due to
        experimental uncertainties in data interpretation. In our
        analysis, the first choice with its uncertainties has been
        taken. This is reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. These occasions are
        rare, and therefore, we have taken them as random errors
        causing fluctuations.
        We discuss some possibilities for the rigidity of
        certain tripeptides. At the outset, we cannot make any
        strict criterion for rigidity. However, statistically more
        often than not the following observations hold. Rigidity
        due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proline</ENAMEX> is well understood because of the side chain
        interacting covalently with the backbone. Consequently, C 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î²</ENAMEX> is held rigidly upto 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> and 
        cis ambiguity. This amounts to the
        fact that essentially Ï† is frozen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-60Â° Â± 20Â°</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        The tripeptide therefore tends to be rigid. On closer
        examination, we find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proline</ENAMEX> in position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the
        tripeptide, makes the tripeptide rigid. This is in
        agreement with the expectations from the covalent bond
        structure.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tryptophan</ENAMEX> are fairly bulky; perhaps, the
        good space filling is the cause for rigidity. Rigid
        tripeptides with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutamine</ENAMEX> invariably also have another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polar</ENAMEX> side chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>; consequently they form a weak
        ionic bond within the tripeptide. Usually <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with
        long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> have more rotameric fluctuations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Occasionally we find they may bind with another residue
        within the tripeptide and end up being rigid. Lastly,
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rigids</ENAMEX> tend to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Threonine residues</ENAMEX>,
        which is consistent with their high polarity. Cysteine,
        which is well known for its tendency to form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di</ENAMEX>-sulfide
        bridge, can fall into either rigid or non-rigid category
        but rarely in the intermediate category.
        A single tripeptide does not have a unique structure,
        indeed it varies as the position of the tripeptide changes
        within a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and across <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This fluctuation is
        captured by the standard deviations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The
        classification of rigid, non-rigid and intermediate is most
        often determined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>) distance alone. Therefore we
        can assess that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different tripeptides have similar
        structure, when their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>) distance along with their
        standard deviations overlap. This criterion implies that
        structurally homologous tripeptides have similar backbones.
        We have also looked at various other cross co-relations
        such as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>) vs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²1,Î²3</NUMEX>) distances, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>) vs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î²3</NUMEX>)
        distances etc. The structural homology conclusion, as
        presented in the results remains unaltered.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Tripeptide analysis is shown to be feasible and
        statistically significant results have been obtained. Some
        regular features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> interactions suggest that
        there are essentially <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of tripeptides: rigid,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-rigid</ENAMEX> and intermediate. These have no correlation with
        the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and hence are
        complementary to such studies. This data may be used to
        predict plausible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for oligopeptides and for
        denovo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> design. Attempts are being made by us to
        develop useful pseudo energy functions to realize the above
        aims.
      
      
        Methods
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> data set of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1220</TIMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> was
        obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Data Bank PDB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] with a sequence
        identity ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¤ 2Â°A</ENAMEX> resolution. This PDB
        list was generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CulledPDB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.L.Dunbrack Jr.</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fccc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/research/labs/dunbrack/pisces/</ENAMEX>), which
        uses an algorithm similar to the remove-until-done
        algorithm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobohm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sander</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . A statistical
        analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.27 million tripeptides</NUMEX> from this set was
        done. If the distribution of tripeptides across proteins
        were random, we would expect each of these tripeptides to
        occur on an average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 34</NUMEX> times. For each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million tripeptides 12</NUMEX> distances <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î²2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²1,Î±2</NUMEX>),
        (Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,Î²2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î²3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²1,Î±3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²1,Î²3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±2,Î±3</NUMEX>),
        (Î±<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,Î²3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²2,Î±3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î²2,Î²3</NUMEX>) were calculated. The mean and
        standard deviation was then computed for each of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. The frequency of occurrence of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> was also calculated. The objective is to find if
        there is a conservation of distances in these tripeptides
        irrespective of where they occur in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>, or
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> they came from.
        As a countercheck for the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reliability</ENAMEX> of our
        analysis, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripeptides</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with sequence identity ranging
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¤ 2Â°A</ENAMEX> resolution was taken and similar
        computational analysis was done. The quantitative results
        as reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2remained</ENAMEX> the same in both the sets.
        Statistical significance became better in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
        sequence identity set. The standard deviation obtained in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> set is therefore much more reliable.
        In order to determine the structural homologs in the
        tripeptides, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Î±1,Î±3</NUMEX>) mean distances were taken in bins of
        0.2Â°A in a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0Â°A</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7.8Â°A</TIMEX>. The number of
        tripeptides from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories rigid,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-rigid</ENAMEX> and intermediate which fall into these 0.2Â°A bins
        was counted. The results are tabulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. Helix
        and beta strand subsequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSMP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extracted</ENAMEX> and the frequency of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of
        tripeptides was computed. The results are tabulated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 5</ENAMEX>.
