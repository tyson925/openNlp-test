        Reading disability (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX>), or dyslexia, is a common
        syndrome with a significant genetic component. Genetic
        linkage studies have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> loci
        located on chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10</ENAMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The linkage to 6p has
        been the most often reproduced in independent samples with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies showing peaks of linkage to different regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> sets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . We recently constructed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC contig</ENAMEX> of the 6p <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> locus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and identified the
        precise location and order of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</NUMEX> short tandem repeat (STR)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> spanning this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . A subsequent study
        with this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marker panel</ENAMEX> identified a peak of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium at marker JA04 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G72384</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        .
        We searched the expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) database,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dbEST http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/dbEST/</ENAMEX>index.html, with
        the genomic sequence corresponding to the peak of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">marker JA04.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> are
        partial and usually incomplete cDNA sequences prepared from
        various tissues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presently</ENAMEX>, nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (dbEST
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">release 04/19/02</ENAMEX>) are catalogued in dbEST representing
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80%</NUMEX> or more of all human genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        representative entry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . While not every gene is
        accounted for in dbEST, computer database searching, also
        known as 
        in silico cloning, can identify new
        genes without actual physically manipulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. These
        types of analyses can also characterize intron-exon
        boundaries, splice variants, tissue specific expression
        levels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene homologies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering ESTs</ENAMEX> together to form a contiguous sequence can
        predict putative open reading frame (ORFs). The first map
        of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, which contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, was
        generated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mapping EST</TIMEX> clusters to human-hamster
        radiation hybrid cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Despite their
        wide-ranging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inherent drawbacks: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        they are based on single sequence reads making them
        vulnerable to sequencing errors, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) they are generated
        from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that may contain unexpressed or
        incompletely spliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> derived from heteronuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or other artifacts. The clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> to form ORFs
        could contain both expressed and unexpressed sequences and
        should be treated with caution. Fortunately, the high
        redundancy of entries in dbEST permits the alignment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple ESTs</ENAMEX> for most genes thus diminishing the effects
        of these drawbacks.
        To identify candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> and other disorders
        mapping to this region we downloaded and searched the two
        million base pairs of genomic sequence surrounding the peak
        of transmission disequilibrium. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX>, risk
        loci for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Beh√ßet's disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , inflammatory bowel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IBD3</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , hypotrichosis simplex (HSS) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dependent type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ,
        attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and
        schizophrenia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] have all been assigned to this general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chromosomal</ENAMEX> location by genetic linkage analysis. Using 
        in silico cloning we identified a
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> pseudogenes and mapped their
        precise physical location and direction of transcription.
        The expression pattern of each gene was characterized by
        examining the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> identified from various
        tissues as well as by qualitative RT-PCR with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        different human tissues. This study also allowed us to test
        the usefulness of 
        in silico cloning to identify and map
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a focussed region of the genome.
      
      
        Results
        Using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">blastc13</NUMEX> server at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>, we performed 
        in silico cloning studies of the 6p
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> locus to identify coding regions. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">623</NUMEX> ESTs
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> different tissues were identified and aligned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mb</ENAMEX> of genomic sequence. These searches captured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX>
        putative coding regions from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> pseudogenes
        concentrated in the central <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> Kb shown in detail in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1with</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> starting at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-prime end of</TIMEX>
        FLJ12671 and ending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kb</ENAMEX> centromeric to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-prime end of</TIMEX>
        RPS10. Short tandem repeat marker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JA04</TIMEX>, which identified
        the peak of transmission disequilibrium for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> phenotypes
        in previous studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb</ENAMEX>. The most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">telomeric 200 Kb</ENAMEX> and the most centromeric <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kb</ENAMEX> of genomic
        sequence are void of coding regions. Intergenic distances
        range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0319</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAF</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> Kb
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HNRPA1 and P24</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cytokeratin 8</ENAMEX>, transcribed telomere to
        centromere, is located in the intron between exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>
        of KIAA0319 (transcribed centromere to telomere). Table

        cDNA, number of exons, genomic mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and putative
        function.
        Thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were previously mapped to this region

        NUP50) and are present on the NCBI accession view
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">017021</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6p21.3-22</ENAMEX>. Our 
        in silico studies identified an
        additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPS10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FLJ12671</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UBE2D2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AP3</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cytokeratin 8</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P24</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pseudogenes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HNRPA1</ENAMEX> and
        ASSP2) not represented on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">017021</ENAMEX>. In addition we
        identified a putative <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> exon for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P24</TIMEX> from hypothalamus
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BG715502</NUMEX>) and pineal gland (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AA363698</NUMEX>) cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
        located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between exons</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-prime untranslated
        region and flanked by non-traditional splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> bases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The novel exon was not present in
        the full-length mRNA sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF418980</NUMEX>).
        The functions of the newly identified genes were
        inferred by their similarity to other known genes
        identified in the BLAST searches. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> L21
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RPS10</NUMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> identical to the genomic and mRNA sequences
        of a known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal gene</ENAMEX>. RPS10 is one of the many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that make up the ribosome macromolecule. Other
        highly homologous genes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPS10</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPS5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPS9</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPS29</TIMEX>,
        RPL5, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPl27a</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPL28</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . FLJ12671s a hypothetical
        gene with an unknown function identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEDO</ENAMEX> human
        cDNA-sequencing project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Blasting the FLJ12671
        sequence against the nr database also identified hits on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, suggesting that this gene has been
        duplicated on several chromosomes. Ubiquitin conjugating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2D2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">UBE2D2</NUMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that targets abnormal or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">short-lived proteins</ENAMEX> for degradation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 26S</TIMEX> proteasome
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The EST</TIMEX> sequences identified for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">UBE2D2</NUMEX> gene
        on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> identical to the human <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">UBC4/5</NUMEX> gene
        located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> suggesting that this gene could be
        a duplicate as well. Adapter-related protein complex 3
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AP3</NUMEX>) may be involved in intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> transport [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cytokeratin 8</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> identical to both the genomic
        and mRNA sequences of keratin. Vesicular membrane protein
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P24</NUMEX>), a previously characterized but unmapped gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        has been localized in intracellular organelles of highly
        differentiated neural cells and may have a role in the
        neural organelle transport system. ASSP2 is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        pseudogenes of argininosuccinate synthetase encoded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        chromosomes with the only functional sequence residing on
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Heterogeneous nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribonucleoprotein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HNRPA1</NUMEX>) is also a pseudogene with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other copies on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 13</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        The copy on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12q13.1</NUMEX> is thought to encode the
        gene responsible for the functional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HNRPA1</TIMEX>, which serves as
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> during export to the cytoplasm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The results of the qualitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, though not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantitative</ENAMEX>, were useful for characterizing the pattern of
        tissue expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). While most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were about
        equally represented in the mRNAs of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> tissues in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> (+)-dependent succinic
        semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0319</ENAMEX> had
        exceptional patterns. P24 was almost exclusively expressed
        in brain by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, correlating with the origin of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        publicly accessible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> suggested that the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSADH</ENAMEX> was
        greatest in brain, though it was ubiquitously expressed in
        all tissues tested. Correspondingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> SSADH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ESTs</ENAMEX> accessible on public domain servers were from brain
        cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, with the remainder of mixed origin.
        KIAA0319 had strong signal from brain and cerebellum mRNA,
        reflected by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> publicly accessible ESTs
        originating from brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The primary goal of this study was to identify candidate
        genes surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6p</NUMEX> and to characterize their patterns
        of expression. A secondary goal was to investigate the
        usefulness of the 
        in silico approaches and specifically
        the dbEST database to identify and map new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Mb</ENAMEX> of the peak of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium - but are some better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> than others? The patterns of tissue
        expression as profiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and the frequency with
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> originated from brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
        serve to highlight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are highly expressed in
        the brain: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P24</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSADH</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GPLD1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIAA0386</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIAA0319</TIMEX>. Of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSADH</ENAMEX>, has been associated with
        a brain related phenotype. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> frameshift mutations, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-to-T</ENAMEX> transversion in the intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>, and
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-to-A transition in the intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>,
        cause an exon to be skipped resulting in abnormal
        metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>, an important neurotransmitter in the
        brain. The handful of described cases were originally
        diagnosed by anomalous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> metabolites in the urine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with developmental and speech delays,
        hyporeflexia, and behavioral problems including mild autism
        with clinical variation between affected family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . There is no data, however, that links <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> or GABA
        metabolism to specific defects of reading independent of
        IQ. None of the other genes highly expressed in brain have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> diseases or clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. GPLD1
        selectively hydrolyzes inositol phosphate linkages in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>, releasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> bound to the plasma membrane
        via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor into the cytosol
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . P24 is a neuron specific membrane protein
        localized in intracellular organelles of highly
        differentiated neural cells and is involved in neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelle</ENAMEX> transport. KIAA0386 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encodes a protein</ENAMEX> that
        stimulates the formation of a non-mitotic multinucleated
        syncytium from proliferative cytotrophoblasts during
        trophoblast differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . KIAA0319 encodes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HT012</TIMEX>, an
        uncharacterized hypothalamus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, could also be
        considered as a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">searches</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX> from brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>) do not suggest
        a high level or selective expression in the brain.
        The 
        in silico studies also identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candidate genes</ENAMEX> for other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that map to this region.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> brain candidate genes described above for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> are
        also reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the neurobehavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders schizophrenia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSS</ENAMEX> results in the
        complete loss of scalp hair in childhood. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Betz et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        described evidence for linkage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSS</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> spanning
        D6S276 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400 Kb</ENAMEX> telomeric of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JA04</NUMEX>) through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D6S1607</TIMEX> (5.6Mb
        centromeric of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JA04</NUMEX>). Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> results nor the
        tissue origin for any single gene suggests any best
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Beh√ßet's disease</ENAMEX> is an autoimmune
        disorder characterized by a systemic vasculitis that
        affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, all sizes and types of blood vessels,
        the lungs, the central nervous system, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> tract [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . There is evidence for
        linkage with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb of 6p</ENAMEX> with JA04
        in the middle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Candidate genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beh√ßet's</ENAMEX> would
        include those expressed in lymphocytes or perhaps bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AP3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLJ12671</ENAMEX> and other immune related
        genes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAF</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU2AS</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may also serve as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for other autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> that map to this
        region such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IBD3</TIMEX>.
        Overall the 
        in silico method for identifying
        genes in a specific genomic region worked well here,
        yielding a reasonable gene density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> kb. This
        method is highly dependent upon the quality of the
        information in dbEST. Any contamination from non-coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, cDNA from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, vectors or
        mitochondria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> could generate false gene assignments.
        Fortunately, the high redundancy of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> hits in dbEST
        increased our confidence that any identification was likely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> and that the searches were sensitive. It is
        possible however, that our 
        in silico approach may have missed
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, in particular those with small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> and/or
        large <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-prime and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dbEST</ENAMEX> expands
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be identified with
        repeated 
        in silico searches, or with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biophysical</ENAMEX> approaches such as cDNA hybridization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ,
        exon trapping [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] and amplification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , or by
        identification of evolutionary conserved sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTF</ENAMEX> islands [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Mb</ENAMEX> surrounding the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium peak with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> at short tandem
        repeat marker JA04 on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6p</NUMEX>. 
        In silico searches of the dbEST
        database identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes. While
        tissue expression patterns suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that are
        highly expressed in brain - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a known association
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurological disease</ENAMEX> - neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data nor the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> information can absolutely rule out any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culpable candidates</ENAMEX>. We conclude therefore that 
        in silico cloning is a powerful and
        effective technique for quickly identifying existing and
        novel genes, which can then be used to develop cDNA single
        nucleotide polymorphism markers (cSNPs) for pinpointing a
        more precise location of the 6p <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> gene, and other disease
        genes that map to this region.
      
      
        Methods
        
          In silico cloning
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs of index genomic sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surrounding marker JA04</ENAMEX> was downloaded from the NCBI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">website</ENAMEX> (accession number NT_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">017021</ENAMEX>). A perl script was
          written to parse the sequence into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> files each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">containing 10 Kb</ENAMEX> segments in FASTA format. Repeat
          sequences were masked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> program
          (RepeatMasker at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://ftp.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">washington</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/RM/RepeatMasker</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>).
          Each masked file was sent to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">blastc13</NUMEX> server as a
          query for searching the dbEST database using the BLAST
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Only ESTs with an identity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> or
          greater were considered; all other hits were discarded.
          Surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were then used to search the nr database
          to identify parental cDNA or mRNA matches, which
          assembled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">623</NUMEX> non-overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> gene or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pseudogene</ENAMEX> antecedents. The BLAST search of nr also
          showed hits against chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> sequence.
          ESTs not mapping to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were also discarded. The
          final assemblies of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and cDNA or mRNA sequences were
          aligned to the index NT_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">017021</NUMEX> genomic sequence using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinez Needleman-Wunsch</ENAMEX> algorithm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MegAlign</ENAMEX> (DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star, Lasergene</ENAMEX>) permitting identification of exon-intron
          boundaries, new exons (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P24</NUMEX>), and the direction of
          transcription relative to the telomere.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qualitative</ENAMEX> PCR
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> containing human total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clontech</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Biosciences</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using the RETROscript
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand synthesis kit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>). 2Œºg of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was denatured with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5ŒºM</NUMEX> of random decamer primers in
          a total volume of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12Œºl</TIMEX>, and heated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">77¬∞C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and placed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> strand cDNA was then
          synthesized with the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2Œºl 10 √ó</NUMEX> RT buffer, 4Œºl
          dNTP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unit RNase</ENAMEX> inhibitor, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Units MMLV</ENAMEX>-RT
          in a total volume of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Œºl</TIMEX>. The reaction was incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44¬∞C</TIMEX>, and then 92¬∞C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> and then
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20¬∞C</TIMEX>.
          To check the quality of the first strand cDNA, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1Œºl</NUMEX> of
          cDNA was used in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction to amplify the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX>/S15
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal gene</ENAMEX>. 1.5Œºl of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 √ó</NUMEX> PCR buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>), 250ŒºM
          of each dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Units</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HotstarTaq</ENAMEX> polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5ŒºM</NUMEX> of primer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>) were used in a 15Œºl
          reaction. The reaction was denatured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at
          95¬∞C, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94¬∞C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65¬∞C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1¬∞C/cycle</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">72¬∞C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          additional cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94¬∞C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55¬∞C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">72¬∞C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, and a final extension of
          72¬∞C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions were performed in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ Research</ENAMEX> thermocycler. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          electrophoresed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gels.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> (primer sequences are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were
          designed to amplify the mRNA sequences of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          genes identified in the transcript map (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Each
          amplicon was designed to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 90 and 150</TIMEX> base pairs
          in length. For each amplicon, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1Œºl</NUMEX> of cDNA, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5Œºl</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> √ó
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250ŒºM</NUMEX> of each dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> units of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) were used in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15Œºl</TIMEX> reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions
          were performed as above. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> lane (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>)
          contained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> step to check for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          contamination. Products were electrophoresed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.
