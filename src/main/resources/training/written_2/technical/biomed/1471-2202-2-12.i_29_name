        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) are secreted
        signaling molecules of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² superfamily that have been
        implicated in the control of a host of critical
        developmental phenomena in the central and peripheral
        nervous systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX>, one of the more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prominently</ENAMEX> expressed BMPs in the nervous system, has been
        detected in multiple regions of the nervous system
        throughout development and into adulthood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , yet
        its biological activities in the nervous system are not
        well defined. A role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in dorsal forebrain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patterning</ENAMEX> has been proposed based on its expression in the
        dorsal midline of the developing forebrain and observations
        that ectopic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in the developing neural
        tube of chicks markedly downregulates ventral markers while
        maintaining dorsal markers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] . Further support for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> regulation of early forebrain development has been
        provided by studies of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bmp5/Bmp7</ENAMEX> double mutants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in the mouse brain exhibits
        peak expression levels in the adult striatum and brainstem
        and that maximal expression in the hippocampus and
        cerebellum occurs at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E18 through PN1</TIMEX> and again in the
        mature nervous system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , suggest additional roles for
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> stages of neural development and into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> have been divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> based on
        structural and evolutionary considerations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Although
        closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> have been shown to elicit distinct
        cellular responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> within a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroup</ENAMEX> often display conservation of not only structure,
        but also function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> belongs to the 60A
        subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>, which also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-6/Vgr-1</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7/OP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-8a/OP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-8b</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60A</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 8</NUMEX> ]
        . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60A</NUMEX> subgroup have been shown to
        modulate neuronal morphogenesis through selective effects
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dendrites</TIMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">BMPs 6, 7</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60A</ENAMEX> stimulate dendritic
        growth in cultured sympathetic neurons derived from either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perinatal</ENAMEX> or adult ganglia in the absence of effects on
        cell survival or axonal growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-7</ENAMEX> has
        also been shown to enhance dendritic growth in hippocampal,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical</ENAMEX> and spinal motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> similarly promotes dendritic growth has
        not been previously addressed. Since dendrites are the
        primary site of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synapse</ENAMEX> formation, we felt it was important
        to examine this possibility. Moreover, since dendritic
        remodeling occurs throughout the life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, such
        studies could suggest a function for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in the adult
        nervous system. In this report, we demonstrate that like
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60A</NUMEX> subgroup, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> triggers robust
        dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons 
        in vitro coincident with activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noggin</ENAMEX> and follistatin, soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known
        to function as physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ,
        also inhibit the dendrite-promoting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-5.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are detected in intact
        sympathetic ganglia and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neuron</ENAMEX>/glia cocultures,
        respectively, consistent with a proposed role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in
        regulating dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons 
        in vivo. 
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> induces dendritic growth in cultured
          sympathetic neurons
          As previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , sympathetic neurons
          grown in the absence of serum and glial cells fail to
          form dendrites (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>); however when grown in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX>, these neurons extend multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrites</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Similarly, addition of recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> to the culture medium elicits dendritic
          growth in sympathetic neurons as evidenced by the
          presence of tapered processes that are immunoreactive for
          MAP2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). Comparative analyses of
          concentration-effect relationships for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-5
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX>; however maximally
          effective concentrations of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> growth factors have
          comparable effects on sympathetic neurons as assessed by
          the percentage of neurons with dendritic growth, the
          number of dendrites per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and the total dendritic
          length per cell. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> course studies of dendritic growth
          in neurons exposed to maximally effective concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> reveal comparable temporal responses
          as well (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> elicit dendrite
          formation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the neuronal cell population
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 to 48</TIMEX> hr (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The gradual increase in
          the number of dendrites per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 17-day</TIMEX>
          treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> parallels that observed in sister
          cultures exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> during the same period (Figure
          3B). Experiments in which cultured sympathetic neurons
          were treated simultaneously with maximally effective
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> indicate that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">effects of BMP-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> on dendritic growth are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">additive</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Treatment of sympathetic neurons with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> induces
          phosphorylation of Smad1
          In most cell systems that have been examined, the
          primary signal transduction pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> involves
          phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and recent evidence
          suggests that this is also true for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> induced
          dendritic growth in sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . To
          determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> initiates similar signaling events in
          sympathetic neurons, cultured sympathetic neurons grown
          in the absence of glial cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 or 60 min</TIMEX> then analyzed by Western blotting using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX>
          specific for total Smad-1 or for phosphorylated Smad-1.
          Phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> is evident within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>) with significantly
          increased pSmad-1 levels apparent at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> min. In contrast,
          treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> did not alter levels of total Smad-1
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Antagonists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>- function inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX>-induced
          dendritic growth
          Recent data suggest that in the developing nervous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, signaling by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least BMPs 2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 7</NUMEX> is
          determined by the spatiotemporal expression patterns of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, and by relative levels of the
          soluble BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> such as follistatin and noggin
          that directly bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> in the extracellular compartment
          and prevent functional receptor/ligand interaction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . The extent to which these factors may
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regulate BMP-5</ENAMEX> signaling is difficult to determine
          because of the paucity of data regarding either
          antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> signaling by follistatin and noggin
          or the interaction between known BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-5.
          To address the former question, we tested the ability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follistatin</ENAMEX> and noggin to block the dendrite-promoting
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX>. The latter was evaluated indirectly
          using a recombinant chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing the
          extracellular domain of the BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> fused to
          the immunoglobulin Fc domain (BMPR-IA-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fc</ENAMEX>). The chimeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMPR-IA</ENAMEX> was chosen because it has been
          previously reported that this is the predominant BMP
          receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal
          superior cervical ganglia (SCG) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . As indicated in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, follistatin and noggin significantly inhibit
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">dendrite</ENAMEX> promoting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in a
          concentration-dependent manner. Maximally effective
          concentrations of noggin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1000 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) and follistatin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1000 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) reduce BMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-induced dendritic growth by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> respectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">BMPR-IA-Fc</ENAMEX> chimera also
          significantly inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5-induced</ENAMEX> dendritic growth.
          Increasing the concentration of any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
          to levels greater than those expressed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5did</NUMEX> not
          cause greater inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5-induced</ENAMEX> dendritic
          growth (data not shown).
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in SCG
          cells
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> is a physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of dendritic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> in sympathetic neurons, then its
          spatiotemporal patterns of expression should be
          coincident with dendritic growth in this neuronal cell
          type. Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> include neuronal and
          glial cells within the ganglia. To examine this
          possibility, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX>) specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> was used to
          immunostain cocultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> neurons and glial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> that
          had been cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> to allow for significant
          expansion of the glial cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The specificity
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> used in these experiments is indicated by
          demonstrations that it recognizes purified recombinant
          BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX>, but not purified recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-6</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> in
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Moreover, the reaction with
          BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5 protein</ENAMEX> is significantly blocked by preincubation
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> with blocking peptide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In SCG
          cultures immunostained with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> is present in most if not all ganglionic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glial</ENAMEX> and neuronal cells (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7Aand 7B</ENAMEX>). In glial
          cells, fluorescence is present throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> but
          excluded from the nucleus; in neurons, immunoreactivity
          is evident in both the soma and processes. Preincubation
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> with specific blocking peptide (Figure
          7Cand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7D</ENAMEX>) reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> to levels
          comparable to those observed in control cultures reacted
          with the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> only (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7Eand 7F</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> expression in vivo was assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>-PCR
          analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> harvested from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> of different ages
          corresponding to various stages of dendritic growth in
          sympathetic neurons. As indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> mRNA
          is present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> at embryonic day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E20</NUMEX>), which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the period of initial extension of primary
          dendrites, and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal days 3 and 7</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PN3 and PN7</TIMEX>),
          which corresponds to the period of maximal dendritic
          growth. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was not detected in adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX> is widely expressed in the nervous system
        throughout development and into adulthood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , yet
        the only function described for this growth factor thus far
        is dorsal patterning of the developing forebrain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
        . Our data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> may also regulate later
        stages of neural development, specifically dendritic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. The most direct support for this hypothesis
        is the finding that addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> to sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in culture causes these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to extend multiple
        dendritic processes. These data are consistent with
        conclusions from previous studies indicating that
        dendrite-promoting activity is restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> from the
        60A or dpp (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BMPs 2 and 4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> and is not observed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-13</ENAMEX> or
        dorsalin, or with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² superfamily
        such as activin, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1, -Î²2</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-Î²3</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Functional
        redundancy between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60A</NUMEX> subgroup has been
        previously reported with respect to other developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , of which some, such as upregulation of
        cell adhesion molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , may be directly relevant
        to effects on dendritic growth. BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> as well as
        dpp subgroup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX>, have been shown to
        influence other aspects of sympathetic neuron development,
        such as differentiation of adrenergic sympathetic neurons
        from neural crest [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] and
        neuropeptide phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . It will be of interest to
        determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> also exhibits functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redundancy</ENAMEX> with
        respect to these effects.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacological</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> indicate that relative
        to BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> is less potent but equally efficacious in
        promoting dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons.
        These data, together with observations that maximally
        effective concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> are not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">additive</ENAMEX>, suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ligands share aspects of a
        common signaling pathway. It has been shown that
        phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> precedes dendritic extension in
        cultured sympathetic neurons exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX>; moreover,
        expression of a dominant negative construct of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> in
        cultured sympathetic neurons significantly inhibits
        BMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-induced dendritic growth in these neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        These data suggest that activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> is a necessary
        component of the signal transduction pathway by which BMP-7
        induces dendritic growth. In this report we demonstrate
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> similarly induces <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in
        sympathetic neurons as detected by Western blot analyses
        using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of
        Smad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. These data suggest conserved mechanisms of
        signaling within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 60A</TIMEX> subgroup. The molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanism</ENAMEX>(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced dendritic growth downstream of
        Smad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> activation are not well characterized. Previous
        studies have demonstrated that transcriptional and
        translational events are required for dendritic growth in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , but the gene expression profile
        responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-induced dendritic growth has yet to be
        determined. Thus, it is not clear if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7</NUMEX> induces
        dendritic growth directly, or if some other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> made by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> is responsible for initiating
        dendritic growth.
        BMPs activate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> by binding to type I and type II
        serine-threonine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . Specific
        receptor subunits shown to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> include BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>
        type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> (BMPR-IA), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR-IB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMR-II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activin</ENAMEX> receptor type I
        (ActR-I), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ActR-II</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> can bind
        to either type I or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> subunits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independently</ENAMEX>, but both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> types are required for
        high-affinity binding and signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The finding
        that the soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMPR-IA-Fc</ENAMEX> chimera significantly inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> induced dendritic growth suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> may be
        activating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> signaling pathway via interactions
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR-IA</ENAMEX>. Although the physiological relevance of this
        finding has yet to be confirmed by ligand binding studies
        using endogenous neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR-IA</ENAMEX>, these data are
        consistent with reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR-IA</ENAMEX> is the predominant BMP
        receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal superior
        cervical ganglia (SCG) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        It is becoming increasingly evident that BMP signaling
        is regulated not only by the spatiotemporal expression of
        BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, but also by relative levels of
        soluble BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, which directly bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and
        prevent functional receptor/ligand interaction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 24 25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . The different BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with varying degrees of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. For example, follistatin binds both activin
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> avidly but competes weakly or not at all with the
        type I receptor for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 45</NUMEX> ] , whereas
        noggin binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> with greater affinity than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> function can be antagonized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noggin</ENAMEX> or follistatin has not been previously reported, but
        our results suggest that simultaneous addition of either
        antagonist with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> significantly inhibits the
        dendrite-promoting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in a
        concentration-dependent manner. Thus, profiling the BMP
        binding affinities as well as the expression patterns of
        these BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> will be critical to understanding the
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> signaling in the nervous system.
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> is important in regulating dendritic growth in
        intact ganglia, its expression should correlate with
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of dendritic growth 
        in vivo . In sympathetic ganglia,
        dendritic growth begins prenatally and maximal expansion of
        the dendritic arbor occurs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal weeks 1 and 2</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . RT-PCR analyses of intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> indicate that cells
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCG express BMP-5</ENAMEX> transcripts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E20 through P7</TIMEX>.
        Preliminary observations indicate that these BMP-5
        transcripts are translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> in vivo as
        assessed by Western blot analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Lein</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished observations). Earlier studies have
        demonstrated the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> transcripts in
        developing avian sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ganglia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] , suggesting
        the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple BMPs</ENAMEX> in sympathetic ganglia
        throughout development. These data, in conjunction with
        observations that mRNA for BMP type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> and type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are expressed in the developing sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ganglia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , are consistent with a potential role for
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX> in regulating the initiation and rapid expansion of
        the dendritic arbor in sympathetic ganglia of perinatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        The cellular distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> was determined by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX> in sympathetic neurons cocultured with
        ganglionic glial cells. Both neurons and glial cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">express BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In situ hybridization analyses of
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> indicate that both cell types also express
        BMP transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Lein</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations). These
        findings are consistent with previous reports that
        dendritic growth can be induced in sympathetic neurons in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> when cultured at high neuronal cell density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] or
        in the presence of ganglionic glial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] .
        Dendritic growth continues, albeit to a lesser extent,
        into adulthood, and dendritic remodeling occurs throughout
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s life. Mature sympathetic neurons cultured from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult animals</ENAMEX> respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> with enhanced dendritic
        growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-7</ENAMEX> enhances recovery
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53 54 55 56</NUMEX> ] . Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was not detected in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX>, Western blot
        analyses indicate that BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5 protein</ENAMEX> is present in adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SCG (P. Lein</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations), presumably derived
        from nonganglionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> such as serum or target tissues.
        These observations together with reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> is
        expressed at significant levels in the adult nervous system
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] suggest a potential role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> in modulating
        dendritic morphology not only during development, but also
        in adult nervous systems.
      
      
        Conclusions
        These data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> regulates dendritic
        growth. Addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> to sympathetic neurons in culture
        triggers significant dendritic growth that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concentration-dependent</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from western blot analyses
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> specific for phosphorylated epitopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad-1</ENAMEX> as
        well as analyses of dendritic growth in cultures exposed to
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX> in the presence of a soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMPR-IA-Fc</ENAMEX> chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are consistent with a signaling pathway that
        involves binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR-IA</ENAMEX> and activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smad</ENAMEX>-1.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> signaling may be modulated by noggin and follistatin
        since these BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were observed to inhibit the
        dendrite-promoting activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX>. Spatiotemporal
        patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> expression at the mRNA level, as assessed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level, as determined by
        immunocytochemistry correspond to periods of initial
        dendritic growth and rapid expansion of the dendritic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">arbor</ENAMEX>. These observations, together with previously
        published reports from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> indicating
        significant levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> expression in the developing
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> nervous system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] suggest a potential role for
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5</ENAMEX> in modulating dendritic morphology not only during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, but also in adult nervous systems.

          that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated

          Tissue culture
          Sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> were dissociated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> of

          Sprague-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dawley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) according to previously
          described methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Cells were plated onto glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslips</ENAMEX> (for immunocytochemical and morphological
          studies) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mm plastic culture dishes (for Western
          blot analyses) precoated with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml poly-D-lysine</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). Cultures were maintained in
          serum-free medium supplemented with Î²-NGF (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ng/ml</ENAMEX>),
          bovine serum albumin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferrin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). In most experiments, endogenous
          non-neuronal cells were eliminated from cultures by
          adding cytosine-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-D-arabinofuranoside</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) to the culture medium at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hr beginning on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX>. In some experiments this antimitotic was not added
          to cultures but rather endogenous non-neuronal cells were
          allowed to proliferate. Previous studies have
          demonstrated that under these culture conditions, the
          non-neuronal cells are primarily ganglionic glia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Morphological analyses
          Dendritic growth was assessed in cultures
          immunostained with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (mAb) previously
          shown to react selectively with the somatodendritic
          compartment of cultured sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX>'s include <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-52</ENAMEX>, which is specific for the
          cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein MAP2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-32</ENAMEX>, which reacts with
          the non-phosphorylated forms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and H neurofilament
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sternberger Immunocytochemicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). Antigens were localized by indirect
          immunofluorescence as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          Dendritic growth was quantified using SPOT image analysis
          system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> in the text are presented as the mean Â±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.E.M.</ENAMEX> and statistical significance was determined using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX>'s test.
        
        
          Western blot analyses
          Western blot analyses were performed on purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinant BMPs</ENAMEX> to assess the specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX>, and on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates of cultured sympathetic neurons
          to assess the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5</ENAMEX> on phosphorylation of
          Smad1 as well as levels of total Smad (nonphosphorylated
          and phosphorylated). Cell lysates were obtained by
          rinsing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-day</TIMEX> old neuronal cell cultures with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold

          maximum speed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> and the resultant supernatant
          collected. Protein concentration was determined using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford</ENAMEX> assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> containing

          Subsequently, blots were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as described
          above, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
          detection method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>). Blots of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates
          were stripped and reprobed using antibodies specific for
          Î±-tubulin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). To quantify data, films were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> was used to localize BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-5 protein</ENAMEX> in SCG
          cultures containing sympathetic neurons and ganglionic
          glial cells. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> in culture, cells were fixed
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> at
          -20Â°C (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>), and then reacted with
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). Immunoreactivity was visualized
          by indirect immunofluorescence as previously described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . The specificity of the immunoreaction was
          determined by preincubating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-5 Ab</ENAMEX> with its
          specific blocking peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) prior to reaction
          with the cultures.
