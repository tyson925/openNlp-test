        Although numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> have been proposed to
        describe the etiology of aneuploidy in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gametes</ENAMEX>, the
        only steadfast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> remains maternal age [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        Besides this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, very little information is
        available about the numerous potential mechanisms that may
        disrupt normal chromosome segregation in oocytes. Based on
        studies involving compounds that alter microtubular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> and induce both cell-cycle delay and aneuploidy,
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have proposed that temporal perturbations
        during mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oocyte</ENAMEX> maturation (OM) predispose oocytes
        to aneuploidy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . In addition to faulty
        microtubule kinetics, perturbations during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> may also stem
        from abnormal function of centrosomes, kinetochores,
        spindle checkpoints <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the anaphase-promoting
        complex (APC), the securin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">separin</NUMEX>-cohesion complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and the proteasome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> encompasses the nuclear and cytoplasmic changes that
        occur during the transition from the dictyotene stage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">meiosis I to metaphase II</ENAMEX> (MII). During this transition,
        tightly-regulated post-translational
        phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events and
        proteasome-mediated proteolytic reactions regulate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and inactivation of signal transduction pathways
        that control chromatin condensation, nuclear membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissolution</ENAMEX>, microtubule nucleation, and formation of a
        haploid oocyte [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Several kinases that exert
        major roles during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> include maturation promoting factor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPF</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] , mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> (MAPKs)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , and the product of the c-mos protooncogene Mos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . Also, during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> oocytes undergo two
        highly-regulated metaphase-anaphase transitions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAT</ENAMEX>) in
        which homologous chromosomes are equally and randomly
        segregated to an oocyte and first polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and a
        subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in which equational division of sister
        chromatids results in a haploid oocyte and a second polar
        body. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATs</ENAMEX> are predicated upon the coordinated
        activities of the spindle checkpoint [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] , the
        anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] ,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , and the cohesion-complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved with chromosome cohesion and separation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alterations</ENAMEX> in the temporal sequence of these
        coordinated activities may potentially predispose cells to
        faulty chromosome segregation.
        Abnormal chromosome segregation has been observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mad2</NUMEX> checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The
        spindle checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utilizes sensory proteins</ENAMEX> that detect
        kinetochore-microtubule tension and occupancy and
        transiently block anaphase until all of the chromosomes are
        properly attached to microtubules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Although
        the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spindle</ENAMEX> checkpoint appears to differ between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> and meiosis, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>, and male
        and female germ cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , anaphase subsequently
        follows stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 29</NUMEX>
        ] in both vertebrate mitotic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and meiotic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
        cells.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that ubiquinates
        mitotic cyclins and other regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are
        destined for timely proteolysis by proteasomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Proteasomes are multicatalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">26S</ENAMEX> proteases consisting of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20S</ENAMEX> central core catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> bordered by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 19S
        components [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] which hydrolyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal peptide
        bonds to acidic, basic, and hydrophobic amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 34</NUMEX> ] . Proteasomes proteolyze securins which inhibit
        separase activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Separase</ENAMEX> is needed for inactivating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohesions</ENAMEX> and enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid separation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and mammalian cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
        ] . Although differences have been reported among species [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] and cell types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , it appears that the majority
        of cohesion is removed from mammalian chromosomes during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prophase</ENAMEX> and prometaphase; whereas, a lesser amount remains
        at kinetochores until anaphase onset. Proteasomes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocated</ENAMEX> to meiotic spindles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat oocytes</ENAMEX> and MG-132
        induced-inhibition of proteasomal activity resulted in
        partial segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ]
        . Moreover, defective proteasomal activity in fission yeast
        impaired chromosome segregation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        To test the hypothesis that transient inhibition of
        proteasomal activity during mouse meiosis I was associated
        with chromosome missegregation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse oocytes</ENAMEX> were exposed
        in vitro to the reversible proteasome inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">metaphase II</ENAMEX> (MII) oocytes were analyzed for structural and
        numerical chromosome aberrations. This transient arrest of
        proteasomal activity represents a perturbation during the
        normal temporal sequence of events during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        Transient exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> oocytes to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h
        followed by washout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 17</NUMEX> h
        culture in vitro enabled exposure of cells during meiosis I
        and sufficient time for them to progress to metaphase II.
        Although the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes were classified as
        normal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A), the data indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG-132</ENAMEX> induced a
        dose-response perturbation or delay in the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> and
        an increase of single, unpaired chromatids and hyperploidy
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). The significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>)
        increase in the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> oocytes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mcg</ENAMEX>/ml group relative to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the
        significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) decrease of oocytes exhibiting
        premature centromere separation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C) in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mcg/ml</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relative to the controls suggest that
        proteasomal inhibition retarded the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX>. An inverse
        relationship has been shown to exist between the
        proportions of arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX> oocytes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exhibiting PCS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) dose
        responses of higher frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes with single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figs.</ENAMEX> 1C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>) and of hyperploidy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figs.</ENAMEX> 1D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>)
        suggest that the MG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>-induced transient inhibition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasomal</ENAMEX> and calpain activities during meiosis I
        predisposed oocytes to abnormal chromosome segregation.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> were continuously exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>,

        Discussion
        Proteasome activity is required for germinal vesicle
        breakdown (GVBD) in starfish and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad oocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] and
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xenopus</ENAMEX> oocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . Also,
        proteasomes are needed for regulating centrosome
        segregation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 47</NUMEX> ] , kinetochore structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid cohesion and separation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . When rat
        oocytes were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MG132</TIMEX>,
        proteasomes translocated to the meiotic spindle, MPF
        activity was sustained, and oocytes were arrested in MI
        with partially segregated chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        Besides inhibiting proteasome activity, the peptide
        aldehyde <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteasome inhibitors</ENAMEX> have been also reported to
        repress certain lysosomal cysteine proteases and calpains [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] . The finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> can obstruct the casein
        degrading activity of the calcium-dependent protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calpain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] appears relevant to oocyte maturation.
        Calpain activity is needed for proteolysis of the c-mos
        proto-oncogene product pp39 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> oocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] ,
        certain cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (alpha-tubulin, actin,
        dynamin, lamin B) in starfish oocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , and of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
        We report that exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> oocytes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mcg</ENAMEX>/ml
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> during meiosis I led to significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>)
        increases in the proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oocytes</ENAMEX> and of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> and hyperploidy. Coupled with these
        findings was a significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) decrease in the
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes exhibiting PCS (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX>
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> arrest in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oocytes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spermatocytes</ENAMEX> indicates cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> which is
        often associated with aneuploidy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 54</NUMEX> ] . Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mcg/ml MG-132</ENAMEX> increased the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> arrested
        oocytes, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> may not be entirely
        attributed to proteasome inhibition. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> can also
        inhibit calpains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] which are needed for cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] and cyclin degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Previous
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 55</ENAMEX> ] have shown that an inverse relationship
        usually exists between the proportions of arrested MI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes exhibiting PCS. Oocytes residing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> for longer periods of time tend to display higher
        frequencies of PCS; whereas, those deferred in MI spend
        less time in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> prior to fixation. The significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>) increase in the proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes exhibiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX> in controls relative to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> reflects
        the greater length of time that control oocytes spent in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> prior to fixation. We suggest that the PCS detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes mainly resulted from in vitro aging. As such,
        the frequencies of PCS noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1would</ENAMEX> represent
        independent events relative to the other cytogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> reported.
        On the other hand, PCS during meiosis I can result in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aneuploid MII</ENAMEX> oocytes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX> of homologous chromosomes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister chromatids</ENAMEX> prior to establishing proper
        kinetochore-spindle attachment during meiosis I increases
        the probabilities of both homologues going to the same pole
        and of equational division of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anaphase I. Upon</ENAMEX> normal fertilization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes with an
        additional chromosome result in trisomic zygotes; whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oocytes</ENAMEX> containing an extra chromatid would be expected to
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> trisomic zygotes due to random segregation
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">anaphase</ENAMEX> II. This situation also applies to oocytes
        missing chromosomes and chromatids. Experimental data
        support PCS as a prelude to aneuploidy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX> of homologues
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">meiosis</TIMEX> I and equational division of sister
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatids</ENAMEX> during anaphase I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] and premature
        separation of chromatids during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">meiosis</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] have been shown to increase the incidence
        of aneuploidy in subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. The partially
        segregated chromosomes found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> oocytes exposed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> may have represented homologous chromosomes and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister chromatids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        The origin of single, unpaired chromatids in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes
        has been proposed to result from premature separation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister chromatids</ENAMEX> prior to anaphase I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] . The
        possibility exists that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> and aneuploidy may have
        originated from PCS of homologues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAT</ENAMEX> of meiosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Upon</ENAMEX> removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> from
        the culture media during meiosis I and the subsequent
        resumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> and proteasomal activity, faulty
        kinetochore-microtubule attachment accompanied by
        degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cohesion proteins</ENAMEX> could conceivably lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX> of homologues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids. Following anaphase
        I, a probability exists that both homologues and sister
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatids</ENAMEX> could randomly assort to the same pole and
        result in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> and aneuploid MII oocytes.
        Although the frequency of homologue separation increased
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> dose, the sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> oocytes is much too
        low to comment about their possible origin or their
        influence on other abnormalities detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes.
        The possibility exists that the observed homologue
        separation may actually reflect anaphase onset. The finding
        of diffuse chromatin in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> continuously exposed to
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.0 and 50.0 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mlMG-132 may be related to the sustained
        elevation of MPF activity noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> oocytes exposed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and the stabilization of polyubiquitinated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and enhanced deubiquitination of nucleosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histones</ENAMEX> in chromatin following proteasomal inhibition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
        ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        The findings of the present study indicate that
        transient in vitro exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> oocytes to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with abnormal chromosome segregation. However,
        additional data are clearly needed to further investigate
        the roles of calpain proteolysis and proteasome-mediated
        proteolysis on chromosome segregation as well as the
        numerous other potential molecular mechanisms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aneuploidy</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> is a peptide aldehyde that inhibits

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat oocytes</ENAMEX>, its activity is reversible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . We
          conducted preliminary experiments to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> dose
          range that would transiently perturb or inhibit OM during
          meiosis I while enabling oocytes to complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX> following
          washing out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from oocytes cultured
          in either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.0</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50.0 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> from
          one h after initiating the culture until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 h later</TIMEX>
          showed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> higher doses completely blocked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, when oocytes were
          exposed to these same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> doses from one h after
          initiating the culture until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h later</TIMEX> when the chemical
          was washed out (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4X</NUMEX>) and cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 17</TIMEX> h
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX>, oocytes exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml MG-132</ENAMEX> were still arrested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. Thus, data from
          these preliminary experiments enabled the selection of a
          protocol in which oocytes were placed into complete
          culture media and incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h prior to adding
          either 0 (solvent only), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.0</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml MG-132</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six h later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> was washed out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> by
          rinsing the oocytes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times in complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> and then re-incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> h. Under this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, oocytes were exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX> during meiosis I
          and the subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> h culture time provided sufficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for the oocytes to overcome the MG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>-induced
          meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> Î¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> per ml complete media and
          processed in the same manner as those exposed to
          MG-132.
        
        
          Cytogenetic analysis and statistical analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          Oocytes were collected and processed according to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX>-harvest procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] and chromosomes were
          C-banded [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] to distinguish between complete dyads
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> chromosomes) and disjoined dyads (single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatids</ENAMEX>). In each cell analyzed, the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> and/or chromatids was counted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> Ã—
          magnification to provide data for calculating aneuploidy.
          The number of hypoploid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-19 1/2</NUMEX>), haploid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>), hyperploid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 1/2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 1/2</NUMEX>), and polyploid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-40</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes were recorded. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocyte</ENAMEX> classified as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 1/2</NUMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> dyads and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chromatid or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyad</ENAMEX>. The frequencies of each ploidy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> were divided
          by the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> analyzed excluding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyploidy</ENAMEX>. The frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> oocytes displaying
          premature centromere separation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCS</ENAMEX>), single chromatids
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>), premature anaphase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) were also calculated
          relative to the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> analyzed.
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> and polyploid oocytes are distinct categories
          and are disregarded when computing aneuploidy, their
          frequencies were calculated relative to the total number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> analyzed.
          The criteria for eliminating a cell from analysis
          included: inadequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>banding for discriminating between
          intact dyads and those separated at the centromere,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapped</ENAMEX> or clumped chromosomes, or excessive
          chromosome scatter that precluded an objective analysis
          of numerical or structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aberrations</ENAMEX>. The frequencies
          of hyperploid cells were used as a measure of aneuploidy
          because an unknown proportion of the hypoploid cells is
          influenced by technical artifact resulting from excessive
          chromosome scatter during slide preparation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-Square</ENAMEX>
          analysis and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fisher's Exact Test</ENAMEX> were used for data
          analyses.
