        Heterochromatin was first distinguished from euchromatin
        cytologically, on the basis of differential staining
        properties [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Molecular and genetic properties that
        further distinguish heterochromatin from euchromatin
        include DNA sequence composition, replication timing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">condensation</ENAMEX> throughout the cell cycle, and the ability to
        silence gene expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. In addition to genes
        required for viability and fertility [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], heterochromatin
        contains essential 
        cis -acting chromosome inheritance
        loci, including elements required for centromere function [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>], meiotic pairing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid
        cohesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. A significant fraction of the fly and
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> are heterochromatic, yet our current
        understanding of the sequence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> is very limited. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterochromatin</ENAMEX> is
        concentrated in megabase-sized tracts in the centric and
        subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. It contains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandemly</ENAMEX> repeated short sequences (satellite DNAs), middle
        repetitive elements (for example, transposable elements),
        and some single-copy sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progress</ENAMEX> has been made
        in the analysis of the non-satellite component of 
        Drosophila, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. Less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progress</ENAMEX> has been made in analysis of satellite sequences,
        although recent studies have revealed the structure and
        composition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centromeric</NUMEX> satellites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterochromatin</ENAMEX> accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 59</NUMEX> megabases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">176-Mb</ENAMEX> genome of the 
        Drosophila melanogaster female, and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mb male Y chromosome</ENAMEX> is entirely heterochromatic
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Polytene chromosomes, which are so valuable in
        mapping euchromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila , provide minimal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> in the heterochromatin. The heterochromatin is
        either severely under-represented or poorly banded in
        polytene chromosomes, and aggregates into an unbanded
        structure known as the chromocenter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. 
        Drosophila heterochromatin is best
        defined by the cytogenetic map of neuroblast mitotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, which resolves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> heterochromatic bands
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h1-h61</ENAMEX>) by differential staining properties [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 25</ENAMEX>]. The
        locations of repeated sequences within the heterochromatin
        have been studied using 
        in situ hybridization of probes
        derived from known repeated elements to mitotic chromosomes
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. This, together with molecular analysis of
        minichromosomes, has elucidated the general organization
        and composition of heterochromatin. Satellite blocks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kilobases</ENAMEX> (kb) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> are interrupted by 'islands' of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-50</NUMEX>
        kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> sequences that contain a high density of
        transposable elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>].
        The transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin
        appears to be gradual rather than abrupt. For example, a
        hallmark of heterochromatin is a high density of
        transposable elements, and the density of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in
        the genomic sequence increases continuously toward the
        centric ends of the euchromatic portions of the chromosome
        arms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. This trend continues in the centric
        heterochromatin, which contains large blocks of specific
        types of middle-repetitive sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 27</TIMEX>].
        Heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been defined by mutations
        that affect viability or fertility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX> screens,
        reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> vital loci in the
        heterochromatin of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> vital loci
        in the heterochromatin of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Although no
        vital loci have been identified in the proximal
        heterochromatin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], several
        identified loci map near the boundary between the centric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> and the euchromatin (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]). There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-linked loci required for male fertility ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>],
        reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]). Thus, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 32</NUMEX> identified
        genetic loci required for viability or fertility in the
        centric heterochromatin. This is likely to be an
        underestimate, because saturating genetic screens have not
        been done for all of the heterochromatin.
        Molecularly characterized 
        Drosophila heterochromatic genes
        encode diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and functions. Examples include 
        light (post-Golgi protein
        trafficking), 
        concertina (Î±-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX>), 
        Nipped-B (morphogenesis), 
        rolled (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX>), poly(ADP-ribose)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> (chromatin structure), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bobbed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>), and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-linked fertility factors 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kl-2, kl-3</ENAMEX> and 
        kl-5 (dynein heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        Genes have been localized on the cytogenetic map through
        analysis of chromosomal rearrangements and by fluorescence 
        in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. The genomic structures of several of these genes
        have been determined, and they differ from those of
        euchromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Their introns and regulatory regions are
        composed of clusters of partial and complete transposable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and some introns are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of kilobases in
        length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43, 44, 45, 46</TIMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> (WGS) assembly of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of
        short, unmapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> representing heterochromatic
        sequence. The most recent version, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>], assembled a
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of the 
        Drosophila genome, using an improved
        assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> and the same trace data used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A high-quality sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> that spans the
        euchromatic portions of the chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> is reported in
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. For the sake of consistency, we refer to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">116.9-Mb</ENAMEX> sequence as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'Release 3</NUMEX> euchromatic sequence'
        even though, on the basis of the cytological criteria for
        defining the boundary between euchromatin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> described below, we believe this sequence
        extends into the centric heterochromatin of each chromosome
        arm. The annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in
        this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of heterochromatin-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are
        reported in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 48</TIMEX>]. Here, we characterize and annotate
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20.7 Mb of WGS3</ENAMEX> sequence, the 'WGS heterochromatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence'</ENAMEX>, that is not represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">116.9 Mb Release</ENAMEX>

        Results
        
          Annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic sequences
          WGS3 was aligned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">116.9 Mb Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence
          spanning the euchromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. The WGS sequence that
          extends beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence (or
          otherwise fails to align) is an unfinished, draft-quality
          assembly of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of the heterochromatic
          portion of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome. The WGS3
          heterochromatic sequence is distributed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,597</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX>. It includes portions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> scaffolds that
          overlap with and extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
          sequences of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">arms X</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3L and 3R</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">712 kb</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,170</NUMEX> sequence gaps accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>).
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX>, particularly those under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb, may map
          within sequence gaps of larger scaffolds.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence was aligned to the
          corresponding portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence. Although
          there are local differences between the two assemblies,
          the order and orientation of sequences are well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. The most significant difference between them
          is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic scaffolds are often
          considerably longer than the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX>. For example, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">252-kb</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> scaffold extends
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 13</NUMEX> smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX>, and includes all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> exons of the heterochromatic gene 
          rolled in the correct order and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). 
          rolled maps to bands <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h40-h41</ENAMEX> on the
          right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
          We annotated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">12.0 Mb of WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic
          sequence in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">85 scaffolds longer than 40 kb</TIMEX>, plus a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX>-kb sequence at the centric end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          euchromatic sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome that was not
          annotated by Misra 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. We arbitrarily
          excluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.7 Mb of WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic sequence in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,512</NUMEX> scaffolds shorter than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kb from detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. Preliminary analysis suggested that gene
          identification in these small scaffolds is hampered in
          part by the separation of exons onto different scaffolds.
          This is illustrated by our annotation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          'super-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX>' that were constructed by linking
          together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 short WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatic scaffolds using
          cDNA evidence (see below). Thus, the scaffolds shorter
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kb do contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, but a reliable annotation of
          these sequences will require further analysis.
          Identifying genes within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">heterochromatin</TIMEX> presents
          challenges not encountered when annotating euchromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Open reading frames (ORFs) in transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> can interfere with the identification of
          single-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>, particularly when
          transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are nested within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">introns</TIMEX>. Also,
          heterochromatic genes can have large introns separating
          relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43, 44, 45, 46</TIMEX>]. Therefore,
          transposable element and low-complexity sequences were
          masked; then the lengths of masked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and sequence
          gaps were reduced to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 bp</NUMEX>, which is the
          median intron length of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">euchromatic protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 50</TIMEX>].
          We annotated the masked scaffolds using the
          computational annotation pipeline developed by Mungall 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] and the annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tool Apollo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. The pipeline generates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and
          filters alignments of expressed sequence tags (ESTs),
          cDNAs, and the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> similarity searches and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-prediction algorithms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apollo</ENAMEX> displays the filtered
          results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> in tiers of evidence, and allows
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> to evaluate and use the evidence to
          construct gene models. The guidelines used to define gene
          models in the euchromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] were modified slightly,
          to deal with the unique properties of heterochromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). We generated 351
          preliminary gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> on the masked scaffolds.
          Next, the preliminary gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were re-curated on
          the unmasked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterochromatic sequence scaffolds</ENAMEX>. The
          unmasked scaffolds were run through the computational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX>, and the preliminary gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
          aligned to this genomic sequence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> preliminary
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> could not be aligned to the unmasked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> using sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. After further examination, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          of these were accepted as curated gene models, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were
          similar to transposable elements and were rejected, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> could not be reconciled with the unmasked sequence.
          A higher-quality genomic sequence may be required to
          verify these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and they have not been
          included here. The remaining preliminary gene models
          aligned in a consistent manner. After re-examination of
          the evidence, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> preliminary gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
          accepted, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene models.
          Because they are present on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatic
          scaffolds shorter than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kb, a number of previously
          known <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> were missed by our
          analysis. We annotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kl-2, kl-3, kl-5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pp1-Y2</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ppr-Y</ENAMEX> ). The WGS sequence data were
          generated from clone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from mixed-sex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, so the male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome is represented by a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold lower density of sequence reads than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autosomes</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-linked genes can have very
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. Consequently, sequences on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
          chromosome are represented by shorter scaffolds in the
          WGS assemblies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-linked
          genes that we annotated were first characterized by
          analysis of short WGS scaffolds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56</TIMEX>]. We used cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to identify short WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> bearing
          fragments of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, concatenated these
          scaffolds into larger scaffolds (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'super-scaffolds</NUMEX>'; see
          Materials and methods), and annotated the resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> models. We produced and
          annotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-scaffold</ENAMEX> (linked_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) using
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-scaffolds</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          gene model.
        
        
          Evidence for the gene models
          We generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene models, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene models. These include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          previously known and molecularly characterized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> in the
          additional data file). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are
          supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> classes of evidence: alignment to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila ESTs</ENAMEX>; alignment to 
          Drosophila full-insert cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> similarity; and prediction by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-finding algorithms. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>)
          that overlap <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> aligned <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> of these
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) are further supported by an aligned cDNA sequence.
          There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">167</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> similarity
          evidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">241</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>) supported by gene
          prediction. The numbers of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> supported by all
          combinations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of evidence is diagrammed in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) supported only by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          evidence require further validation, because cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> can be contaminated with various artifacts,
          including sequences from unprocessed transcripts. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>
          models (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) supported only by gene prediction are
          included in our curated set because they encode peptides
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with no significant
          similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by transposable elements
          (see below). Finally, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) supported only
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> similarity have BLAST or TBLASTX expect scores
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>values) of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 1 Ã 10 -10to</NUMEX> sequences in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          We excluded gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 95%</NUMEX> identity
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> bp to known transposable elements. We then
          examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> remaining preliminary gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> Ã <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -9when</TIMEX> compared to a
          database of transposable elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], and we retained
          all but one of them in our annotation. Although these
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have weak similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by
          transposable elements, the extent of similarity is
          insufficient to suggest that they represent 
          bona fide transposable element
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> represent the genes 
          kl-5 and 
          scro , and the region of similarity
          in 
          scro corresponds to the homeodomain
          of this transcription factor gene. To further verify that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic annotations do not show
          significant homology to transposable elements, we
          compared the distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterochromatic</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> similarity
          to transposable elements over a range of expect scores
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This analysis shows that the percentage of
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with weak similarity to transposable elements
          is comparable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatic annotation and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic annotation.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are supported by
          fewer data than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic gene models. In
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have an
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overlapping EST</TIMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euchromatin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent</NUMEX> of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in the WGS3
          heterochromatin are based on full-insert sequences of
          cDNAs, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 70%</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">euchromatin</ENAMEX>.
          However, this observation is biased because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> were
          selected for full-insert sequencing based on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> gene models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>], and the WGS3
          heterochromatin annotation preserves few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          models and adds many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Many WGS3
          heterochromatic gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are based solely on gene
          predictions. Despite generating a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-finding algorithms were less successful at
          predicting heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than euchromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 72%</NUMEX> of the heterochromatic gene models
          are supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> predictions, as opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic gene models.
          Finally, we annotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding RNA</ENAMEX>
          genes. WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scaffold 211000022279294</ENAMEX> contains rDNA
          sequences, including two complete copies each of the 5.8S
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> rRNAs, a truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18S</ENAMEX> rRNA sequence that extends
          into a sequence gap, and a truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX> rRNA sequence
          that extends beyond the end of the scaffold. This region
          probably represents a portion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the two 
          bobbed loci, which map to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and
          Y chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58, 59</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were annotated by
          similarity to euchromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the Additional data file).
        
        
          Comparison to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotation
          The annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic sequence has
          increased both the number and quality of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in
          the heterochromatin, relative to the corresponding
          portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> in the
          additional data files). During the curation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> from the corresponding portion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> were deleted, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> new gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
          created. Many of the deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotations
          represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that overlap transposable elements. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterochromatin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> gene models
          were merged into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was
          split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> annotation
          was split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, one of which was merged with
          another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 30</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">130 Release 2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were preserved intact in the
          new annotation; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> previous models were preserved with
          modifications. Thus, a much higher fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> was modified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatin
          annotation than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic annotation,
          in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two-thirds</NUMEX> of predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were
          unchanged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
          As in the annotation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, the increased numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and cDNA
          sequences available for alignment to the WGS3
          heterochromatic sequence resulted in significant
          improvements in the annotation of untranslated regions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>), alternative transcripts, and intron-exon
          structures (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> in additional data
          files). Twice as many genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatin have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">annotated 5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> as in the corresponding portion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' UTR length is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">258 bp</NUMEX> and the
          average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' UTR length is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">335 bp</NUMEX>, both of which are close
          to the average UTR length of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> transcript;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> were annotated in the corresponding portion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">377</NUMEX> predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          transcripts encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,096</NUMEX> distinct exons, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as
          many as were annotated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. The average number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> per gene model increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>, but
          remains below the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> average in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euchromatin</ENAMEX>. The average length of introns increased
          significantly, from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">892 bp</NUMEX> in the corresponding portion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,743 bp</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatin. The
          longest annotated intron in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatin is
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">119,217 bp</NUMEX>, dwarfing a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,613 bp</NUMEX> intron that was the
          longest in the corresponding portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> introns <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 10 kb</TIMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in WGS3
          heterochromatin have introns <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 10 kb.</TIMEX> Whereas
          the majority of annotated introns in both the WGS3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">euchromatin</ENAMEX> are in the
          range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-70</NUMEX> bp, there are clearly more long introns in
          heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Annotations of selected regions
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic scaffold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">594 kb long</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) and incorporates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">separate Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX>. The sequence of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> is contained within a previously described BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contig</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 61</TIMEX>]. Because the scaffold contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> well
          studied autosomal heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          light and 
          concertina , analysis of its
          sequence provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both the WGS3</TIMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and the annotation
          process over an extended heterochromatic region. This
          scaffold maps within band h35 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Lh</TIMEX>, and its orientation
          with respect to the centromere is known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 61, 62</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scaffold</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX> kb proximal to the
          end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2L</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] as
          determined by genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> blots using single-copy
          probes derived from the ends of the scaffold and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3 2L</ENAMEX> sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> is entirely consistent with previous 2Lh mapping
          studies in that the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> single-copy sequences
          and the predicted 
          Not I, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pme I, and</ENAMEX> 
          Sfi I restriction maps of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> (except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> regions corresponding to
          sequence gaps) are the same as those observed in the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig and on genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> blots.
          We annotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX>.
          The annotation of the 
          rolled gene illustrates how masking
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence improved Genscan
          performance and simplified curation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sequences</ENAMEX> define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative 
          rolled transcripts that differ in
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. All 
          rolled exons defined by the cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> align to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic scaffold and
          the masked scaffold in the correct order and orientation.
          In the annotation of the unmasked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scaffold</ENAMEX>,
          transposable elements within 
          rolled introns interfered with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> so that a very poor 
          rolled gene prediction was
          generated, and protein similarity results of transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> complicated the evidence. In the annotation of
          the masked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genscan</ENAMEX> predicted a single gene
          model that includes all but one 
          rolled coding exon, and protein
          similarity evidence supported the exon that Genscan
          missed.
        
        
          Transposable elements
          We carried out a preliminary analysis of the
          transposable element sequences found in the WGS3
          heterochromatic sequence. We used a database of
          transposable elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>] to
          measure the amount of sequence that was derived from each
          transposable element <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Many of the sequences we
          identified represent only portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>; such
          fragmentary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are often generated when
          transposable elements insert into one another to form
          complex nests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Despite this complication, we were
          able to estimate the contribution of each transposable
          element class.
          The most striking observation is the high <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence that is derived from
          transposable elements. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.7</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mb</ENAMEX>
          WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterochromatic sequence</ENAMEX> had similarity to known
          transposable elements. Using similar analyses,
          transposable elements account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 5.0%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence; a slightly lower value of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9%</NUMEX> was obtained in the analyses reported in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>],
          which required a higher level of sequence conservation.
          There were also some differences in the relative
          contributions made by different classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> and euchromatin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> represent
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> of euchromatic transposable elements and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 78%</NUMEX> of heterochromatic elements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> of the euchromatic and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the
          heterochromatic transposable element sequence. TIR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> in euchromatin and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were identified using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX>; a more targeted search identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> kb
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FB</ENAMEX> element sequence.
          Although we found a much higher density of
          transposable element sequences in the heterochromatin
          than in the euchromatin, it is likely that we missed many
          heterochromatic transposable elements. In fact, we found
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> with similarity to transposable elements, such as
          those encoding transposases, outside those regions we
          annotated as transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7a</TIMEX>, for
          example), suggesting the existence of novel transposable
          element <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Finally, many of the sequence gaps
          within scaffolds probably correspond to regions of the
          genome with very high transposable element density. Thus,
          our analysis almost certainly represents an underestimate
          of the total transposable element content of the WGS3
          heterochromatic scaffolds. As repetitive elements are
          difficult to assemble using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> strategy, an accurate
          estimate of their contribution to the heterochromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence</ENAMEX> awaits a more finished version of the
          sequence.
        
        
          Cytological boundaries of centric
          heterochromatin
          Although there is no universally accepted definition
          of heterochromatin, the most reliable classification of
          the centric heterochromatin is cytological. Therefore, we
          consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> located within the bands (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h1-h61</ENAMEX>)
          of the cytological map defined on mitotic chromosomes to
          be heterochromatic. In order to correlate heterochromatin
          cytology with the genome sequence, we mapped the
          boundaries of the euchromatin and centric heterochromatin
          on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">arms X</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3L and 3R</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC-</ENAMEX>derived probes to mitotic chromosomes (see Materials
          and methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were selected from the centric ends of
          the essentially finished <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence contigs that
          span the euchromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>], and the positions of the
          resulting hybridization signals on the cytological map
          were determined (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These data show that
          the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence contigs extend into the
          centric heterochromatin on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were localized to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (data not
          shown), the cytology of this chromosome is too poor to
          permit a clear <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based mapping of the boundary of the
          centric heterochromatin. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome has no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundary</ENAMEX>, because it is entirely heterochromatic.
          For the purposes of defining the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content of the
          heterochromatic portion of the genomic sequence, we
          provisionally designate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the distal</TIMEX> ends of the indicated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) as defining the boundaries of the centric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> within the finished genomic sequence.
          However, the transition from euchromatin to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> appears to be gradual rather than sharp,
          and the resolution of these cytological mapping
          experiments appears to be on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb.
          Therefore, we have approximately localized the
          heterochromatin-euchromatin boundaries with respect to
          the genomic sequence, and have defined precise boundaries
          here simply as a convenience in discussing the genome
          annotation data. By this definition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          sequence that spans the euchromatin includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of
          sequence in centric heterochromatin, and this sequence
          includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> curated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> described in Misra 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. These genes are in
          addition to those identified in our analysis, which was
          restricted to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic scaffolds
          described above.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> that we localized on the cytological map of
          the mitotic chromosomes have also been positioned using 
          in situ hybridization to salivary
          gland polytene chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47, 60</TIMEX>]. Although banding in
          the proximal regions of the polytene chromosomes is not
          as distinct as in the euchromatic regions, comparison of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> datasets shows the approximate extent of overlap
          between the mitotic and polytene cytogenetic maps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The boundary of the centric heterochromatin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosome at the distal edge of band <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">h26</NUMEX> corresponds
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> to polytene division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20C</TIMEX>, band h35 on
          chromosome arm 2L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to polytene division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40A</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">band h45</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX> corresponds to polytene division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41F</TIMEX>, band
          h47 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3L</TIMEX> corresponds to polytene division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80A</TIMEX>, and band
          h58 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3R</TIMEX> corresponds to polytene division <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82C</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Improvements to the annotation
          The annotation of the heterochromatic portion of the 
          Drosophila genome described here is
          a work in progress. We have annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          genes, and summarized preliminary observations on
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> and transposable elements. Our
          analysis was limited by the high repeat content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> and by the unfinished quality of the WGS3
          heterochromatic sequence. Our decision to delay
          annotation of the scaffolds shorter than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kb has
          probably resulted in failure to identify some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          especially on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome. Despite these
          limitations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene annotations are
          generally reliable, as demonstrated by the identification
          of previously known heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and the
          alignment of cDNA sequences to the draft genomic sequence
          and the annotated gene models. Nevertheless, the quality
          of the annotations will be greatly improved by the
          addition of more full-length cDNA sequences of
          heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and by comparative analysis using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosquito</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>] and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>] WGS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          Future analyses of the differences between euchromatic
          and heterochromatic sequence may lead to improvements in
          the performance of computational gene-prediction
          algorithms on heterochromatic sequence. Our observations
          that the gene-prediction tools <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>] performed relatively poorly in identifying
          heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> suggests that these programs could
          be modified to improve their performance on
          heterochromatic sequence. Processing the genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, by masking repeats and reducing the distances
          between potential coding exons, improved the performance
          of the gene-prediction tools, and improved gene
          identification during subsequent re-annotation of the
          unmasked sequence. Optimization of these preprocessing
          steps should lead to improved performance. The annotated
          gene models that are supported by cDNA and/or
          high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> matches provide a useful dataset for
          training and testing gene-prediction algorithms on
          heterochromatic sequence.
          A collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> transposable element insertions
          in heterochromatin has recently been generated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>]
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.Y. Konev</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.M. Yan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. O'Hagan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Tickoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.H.K.</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data). These 
          P element insertions will provide
          tools for the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterochromatic genes</ENAMEX> and
          manipulation of the heterochromatic portion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. For example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -element-mediated deletions of
          centric heterochromatin have been used to map genes and
          regions responsible for controlling gene expression and
          replication [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Improvements to the genomic sequence
          We plan to improve the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence
          by filling sequence gaps and correcting assembly errors.
          The quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> suggests a strategy for
          bringing these sequences to high quality: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, select a
          tiling path of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb genomic clones from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> that
          span each scaffold; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, sequence each clone to high
          quality; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, assemble these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb sequences to
          reconstruct the genomic sequence; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, verify the
          assembly by comparison to cDNA sequence alignments and to
          restriction digests of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, assayed if necessary
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> blots. cDNA alignments will also be useful in
          linking separate scaffolds in cases in which the exons of
          a single gene lie in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> scaffold. We gained
          extensive experience in each of these steps during our
          finishing of the euchromatic portion of the genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>],
          and no new technology is required to bring the WGS
          scaffolds we have described here to finished quality.
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the heterochromatin are clonable in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contigs from the genome physical
          map are located in the centric heterochromatin of
          chromosome arms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3L</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. Draft sequences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> spanning these contigs were produced during the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX> phase of the genome-sequencing project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>]. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX> corresponds to the WGS3
          scaffold that includes 
          light and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concertina</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>],
          and the contigs on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R and 3L</TIMEX> also align to WGS3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX>. We have also identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BACs</ENAMEX> containing the 
          rolled, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> and 
          SNAP25 genes in pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS</ENAMEX> content
          mapping experiments in the heterochromatin. Doubtless
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the heterochromatin will be represented
          in large-insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> will be useful for
          linking and orienting short WGS3 heterochromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX>. However, we were unable to identify BACs
          containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-linked genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ccy</ENAMEX> and 
          kl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> in available 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 72</TIMEX>],
          perhaps due to high satellite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content. This suggests
          that not all heterochromatic regions assembled in WGS3
          will be represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>. We also do not yet know
          whether the highly repetitive nature of heterochromatin
          decreases the stability of sequences cloned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>. For
          these reasons, we favor a sequence-finishing strategy
          based on the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones generated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Genomic sequence alignments
          The alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> to the essentially finished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence spanning the euchromatin is described
          in Celniker 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> that
          did not show significant alignment were defined to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatic</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> aligned
          to the centric ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence
          and extended beyond them. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sim4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUMmer</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>] to realign these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> scaffolds, and the sequence
          extending beyond the aligned portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          euchromatic sequence contigs was extracted with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX> and included in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WGS3</TIMEX> heterochromatic
          sequence. Finally, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX>-kb region including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BACR48D21</ENAMEX> at
          the centric end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3 X-chromosome</ENAMEX> sequence [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>] was not included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euchromatin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. This sequence was included in the
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> heterochromatic sequence.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence scaffolds were
          aligned to the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence scaffolds
          using BLAST2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>]. The alignment results were carefully
          examined, and the two assemblies were found to have few
          discrepancies.
        
        
          Masking sequence scaffolds
          We masked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequences before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>], with the default
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, to mask transposable elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and
          low-complexity sequences. Next, we shortened all sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> and repeat-masked regions to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 bp</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Databases</ENAMEX> and tools
          To annotate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic sequence, we used
          the computational analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> and databases
          described in Mungall 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. This pipeline aligns 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila ESTs</ENAMEX>, cDNA sequences,
          and other sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> using sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>], performs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and protein sequence similarity searches of the

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> were filtered using the Bioinformatics
          Output <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parser</ENAMEX> (BOP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>], and the filtered results were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curated</ENAMEX> using the tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curation</ENAMEX> guidelines
          To determine the intron-exon structure of gene models,
          curators visually inspected the alignment of
          computational evidence types to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> heterochromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>. Alternative transcripts supported
          by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> were annotated. The criteria
          used to curate the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WGS3</TIMEX> sequence were
          identical to those used in the annotation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euchromatin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exceptions. First,
          computational results derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genscan</ENAMEX> were not
          judged by their scores, as it was empirically determined
          that low-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> results often correctly
          predicted the intron-exon structures suggested by other
          evidence types such as cDNAs. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> annotation were compared to a
          curated transposable element dataset [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Gene models
          with an alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</NUMEX> nucleotides with at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> identity to transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were
          rejected.
          Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> produced on the masked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> were
          mapped to the unmasked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX> sequence using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sim4</ENAMEX>. Gene
          models that aligned with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 95%</NUMEX> identity to the
          unmasked sequence were not preserved. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
          checked to ensure that they did not overlap transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> and that they did not have major alterations of
          their intron-exon structure due to the presence of
          unmasked data. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were refined using evidence
          that had not aligned to the masked WGS3 sequence.

          The location of the BAC signals relative to the DAPI
          banding pattern on the heterochromatic map was determined
          by visual analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Photoshop</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>). In addition, an
