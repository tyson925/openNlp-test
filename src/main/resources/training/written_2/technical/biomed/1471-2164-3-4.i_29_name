        The introduction of small subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> as a
        tool in microbial taxonomy by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Woese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Fox</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] led most microbiologists to assume that the concepts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and plant taxonomy could be extended to the realm of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX>. In particular, it was assumed that a natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomic</ENAMEX> system for microorganisms was feasible [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The goal of a natural taxonomic system is the formation of
        taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that are defined by shared ancestry [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        . By definition, an ancestor that defines a monophyletic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> can only give rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> outside this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has a lineage that traces back
        to the same ancestor (paraphyletic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>); however, there
        might be earlier ancestors that define more inclusive
        monophyletic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The metaphor for organismal evolution
        that underlies a natural taxonomic system is a strictly
        bifurcating <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>
        promised that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it might be possible to place every
        extant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> on a universal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of life, and the hope
        was that more genomic sequences would make this placement
        more accurate.
        However, the analyses of completely sequenced genomes
        initiated a reassessment of concepts in microbial evolution
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . While some molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> were found to agree
        with one another e.g., [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , others do not [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Transfer of genetic information between divergent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> has turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of life into a net or web [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] , and genomes into mosaics. Different parts of genomes
        have different histories, and representing the history of
        genome evolution as a single tree appears inconsistent with
        the data. Nevertheless, the assumption of a tree-like
        process still underlies many approaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genome</ENAMEX> content
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> have been calculated based on the presence and
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] or types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folds</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . While there is limited agreement between genome and
        rRNA phylogeny, at present it remains unclear whether this
        similarity is based on shared ancestry of part of a less
        frequently exchanging genome core [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , or if the
        apparent congruence is itself the result of horizontal gene
        transfer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Overall genome content is not best represented on a
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1gives an example of an alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depiction</ENAMEX>, where thickness of a line reflects percentage of
        genes shared between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomes. The coherence among the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains of life (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria, Archaea, Eucarya</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ),
        is clearly reflected in genome content; i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX> share
        more genes with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Archaea</ENAMEX> than with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, but many
        features are incompatible with representing the
        relationships between different genomes as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. For
        example, the mesophilic euryarchaeon 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. has more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
        common with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesophilic Bacteria</ENAMEX> than does the
        thermophilic crenarchaeote 
        Aeropyrum pernix . However, the
        extremophilic euryarcheote 
        Archaeoglobus fulgidus shares many
        more genes with the extremophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, 
        Aquifex aeolicus and 
        Thermotoga maritima than does 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halobacterium</ENAMEX> . While this example
        illustrates the web-like relationships among genomes,
        recent phylogenetic reconstructions from molecular data
        have explored only few alternatives to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-paradigm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] ).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious drawback of the star-like representation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1is that it utilizes BLAST search results only. Any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> information retained in the sequences is not
        utilized beyond the presence or absence decision based on a
        single expectation value cut-off. Because of recombination,
        individual genes themselves might be mosaic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ;
        however, within-gene recombination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coding genes</ENAMEX>
        occurs mostly between closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The
        redundancy of the genetic code greatly reduces
        recombination between divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Even if a region
        is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> conserved on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> level, the encoding DNA
        can be so different as to allow the mismatch repair system
        to prevent recombination. For studies of single divergent
        orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein encoding genes</ENAMEX> the assumption of a
        tree-like evolutionary history remains a reasonable
        expectation. In this manuscript we focus on methods that
        utilize the phylogenetic information that is retained in
        molecular sequence data, while not presuming that genomes
        as a whole evolved in a tree-like fashion.
        In an elegant approach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korbinian Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arndt von</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haeseler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] utilized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities
        to assess the phylogenetic information contained in an
        alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> homologous sequences. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sequences
        there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> possible tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX>, and thus the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> posterior probabilities corresponding to these three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trees</ENAMEX> must sum up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Utilizing a barycentric
        coordinate system, the resulting probability vector is
        represented as a point in an equilateral triangle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
        where the distances of the point P to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sides
        represent the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> probabilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
        Haeseler applied this approach to depict the phylogenetic
        information content present in a multiple sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. They plot the results from the analyses of all
        possible quartets, where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are selected
        from a single multiple sequence alignment in the same
        coordinate system. If there is a lot of phylogenetic
        information in the alignment, then most probability vectors
        will fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX>; conversely datasets
        containing little phylogenetic information will mainly
        result in vectors falling into the center of the triangle.
        Here we explore the application of this and similar
        approaches in comparative genome analyses. In particular,
        we compare different approaches to calculate Bayesian
        posterior probabilities, and we compare these probabilities
        to the more widely used bootstrap support values. We assess
        the reliability of the different probability mapping
        approaches through their application to mitochondrial
        genomes, and we illustrate their usefulness by mapping
        selected interphylum and interdomain relationships.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Overview of data flow in probability mapping
          An outline of our approach to genome probability
          mapping is given in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SEALS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and
          MySQL we developed scripts that identify and retrieve 
          quart ets of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> rthologous 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> rotein-encoding open reading frames
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> selected genomes. We use the term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> to denote the collection of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> identified in
          a genome. (In the case of genomes that are not well
          annotated, it is feasible to use a very wide definition
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>, e.g, all amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> encoded between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          stop codons in any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> possible reading frames. As
          long as one of the genomes included in the analyses is
          properly annotated, only those identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that are
          actually homologous to an identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> will become part
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> of orthologs.) We utilize an operational
          definition of an ortholog: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> open reading frames are
          considered orthologous, if and only if they are each
          other's top scoring BLAST hit when one is used as a query
          to search the other genome. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> is formed when each
          of the open reading frames picks the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quartet</ENAMEX> as the top scoring hit in searches of the
          respective genomes. QuartOPs are similar to the clusters
          of orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (COGs) maintained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] , but differ in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> require only
          unidirectional, circular best hit relationships for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          of the reference genomes, whereas we require the
          reciprocal top hit relationship for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genomes
          included in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX>, and we do not limit our
          identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> to a number of reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montague</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchison</ENAMEX> utilized a comparable
          approach in their definition of congruent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          So far we have analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> quartets (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> material). The number of QuartOPs
          identified per genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">82</NUMEX> (for genome
          quartet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#6</NUMEX>: 
          Deinococcus radiodurans, Treponema
          pallidum, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Escherichia coli</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX> .) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1182</TIMEX> (for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">genome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#63</NUMEX>: 
          Agrobacterium tumifaciens,
          Sinorhizobium meliloti, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mezorhizobium</ENAMEX> loti and 
          Caulobacter crescentus ).
          Each of the aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> from a genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> was
          analyzed with respect to the posterior probability of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible tree topologies given the aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX>.
          Routinely we calculated these probabilities using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Haeseler</ENAMEX>'s approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] : Using
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> topologies as a usertree, we calculated
          the maximum likelihood for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> topologies
          given the data. We then use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> maximum likelihoods
          to calculate the probability for topology 
          i according to the formula: 
          P 
          
            i 
           = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ), where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           is the likelihood for the best tree given topology 
          i . Other types of reliability
          measures used to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> were bootstrap support
          values and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities estimated
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> program (see below).
          An example for the comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four genomes</NUMEX> from
          different phyla is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A. Surprisingly, each
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX> is strongly supported by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>, and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> appear to
          strongly support one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. None of the three
          possibilities has majority support. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5lists</NUMEX> the
          functional categories of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that strongly
          support the different tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX>. None of the
          categories shows a preference for a particular tree
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of the
          strongly supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> belong to the category
          "information storage and processing", while this category
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 1/3</NUMEX> of the genes present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. While the genes in this category appear more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> and phylogenetically informative, the strong
          support that the genes in this category provide is nearly
          evenly split between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possibilities.
        
        
          Impact of model parameters and sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>
          To test if ill-aligned sequences might have had an
          impact on the analyses, we repeated the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">genome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 8</NUMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) using only QuartOPs
          that contained very similar sequences. By default we only
          excluded top hits with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value larger than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>. We
          repeated the example given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Awith a cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>, i.e., we not only required the sequences in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> to be each others top hit, but in addition we
          asked for a high similarity between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences. As
          a result the support for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> topologies in genome
          quartet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>) (the numbers in parenthesis are the numbers of
          quartets that support the topology with posterior
          probability larger than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90% and 99%</NUMEX>, respectively). To
          access the level of sequence conservation within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>' sequences, we calculated the average percentage
          of pairwise identity per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX>. It varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.53</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.54% to 43.84 ± 9.7%</NUMEX> when the E-value cut-off was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">varied</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10 -2and 10 -20</TIMEX>(see supplementary material
          for the summary table). While pairwise sequence identity
          is not a universally dependable measure of phylogenetic
          information content, these values illustrates that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">QuartOP</ENAMEX> are neither identical to one
          another, nor so divergent as to be saturated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> and of questionable homology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Using
          only the most conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> does not change the
          qualitative result: each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible tree
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topologies</ENAMEX> is supported by about an equal number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> (see supplementary material).
          We recalculated the likelihoods for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">genome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> using a model that incorporates 
          a mong

          r ate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> ariation (ASRV). The posterior
          probabilities calculated according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haeseler</ENAMEX> did not change dramatically and each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX> is still supported by roughly equal
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>. The maps for this analysis are
          available in the supplementary material.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX>), each with the same prior probability. These
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are those that have the highest likelihood
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible topologies. However, there are
          infinitely many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that differ from the three
          chosen ones only by differences in branch lengths. What
          is the effect on the calculated posterior probability of
          using only the single best <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of
          all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with the same topology? There is no 
          a priori reason to exclude the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that have slightly lower likelihoods.
          A different approach that does not make these
          assumptions is the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>
          methods to explore tree space. We used the program
          MrBayes written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huelsenbeck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronquist</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Using a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QuartOP</ENAMEX> with posterior probabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.76</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> we explored different parameter choices for the
          biased random walk through <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-space. We chose two
          chains with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> burn-in cycles, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> after every cycle as a compromise between
          increased precision of the probability estimate and
          computation time (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and Methods for more
          details).
          The result of calculating the posterior probabilities
          of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> in genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> is given in figure
          4B. Again all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX> are strongly
          supported by some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>. When we repeated this
          analysis using the same settings, none of the
          probabilities changed by more than a few percent. The
          support for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topologies changed from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67/47/37</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69/40/22 and 86/55/32</NUMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> numbers
          indicate total support and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that supported a
          topology with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than .90 and .99</NUMEX> respectively) in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> run to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67/47/37</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70/41/22 and 85/55/32</NUMEX> in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, indicating that the chosen parameters provided
          satisfactory reproducibility. Plots of both analyses are
          available in the supplementary material. Comparing figure
          4Bwith <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4Ait</ENAMEX> is clear that in this case the Bayesian
          posterior probabilities estimated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> are more
          conservative assessments of reliability than the ones
          calculated according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> support level
          calculated according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX> corresponds
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> support level calculated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Bootstrap support values versus posterior
          probabilities
          To facilitate comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior
          probabilities with a more widely used confidence measure,
          we generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrapped samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> in case <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bootstrapped samples</ENAMEX> was
          analyzed using maximum likelihood with the same model of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> as before. Each of the bootstrapped samples
          supports one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible topologies, thus the
          sum of the bootstrap support values for the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">topologies</ENAMEX> adds up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, and the percentage of
          bootstrapped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> that best supported
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was again plotted in a barycentric coordinate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C). Many more QuartOPs map into the central
          region of the triangle as compared to Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Aand 4B</TIMEX>.
          Clearly, for this test bootstrap support values are more
          conservative measures of support than either of the
          posterior probabilities calculated above. Nevertheless,
          there are still several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that strongly support
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX>; however, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          QuartOPs that support grouping 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> with 
          Treponema pallidum with better than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> bootstrap support, whereas the alternatives are
          supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12 and 13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comparing Figures 4Aand 4Cit</ENAMEX> appears that in analyzing
          quartets <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> bootstrap support is comparable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.99</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> probability calculated according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Comparison of the different reliability assessment
          tools
          ML-mapping according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] is the least
          conservative of the tools explored. For the test cases
          analyzed a posterior probability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.99</NUMEX> according to [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] , corresponds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probability of
          .90 calculating using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> exploration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tree-</ENAMEX>space using [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> bootstrap support.
          We did not find a strong dependence of the results on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">substitution</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> used in calculating likelihoods and
          separate runs indicated satisfactory precision of the
          calculated probabilities and bootstrap values. Given that
          we only analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          approaches it would be premature to generalize our
          findings; however, other analyses that utilized both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities also
          found bootstrapping to be more conservative than
          posterior probabilities calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> methods
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> sampling (e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX>
          ] ).
        
        
          Mitochondrial genomes
          While gene transfer into the mitochondrial genomes has
          been inferred [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38 39</NUMEX> ] , mitochondrial genomes are
          expected to have undergone many fewer legitimate and
          illegitimate recombination events than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX>. Clearly, if probability mapping is to be
          considered a reliable approach, we expect that when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyzing</ENAMEX> quartets of mitochondrial genomes, the
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> should all support the same tree
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX>.
          In most instances, this expectation is fulfilled (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>), even though we selected instances in which the
          splits could be expected to be ill resolved, e.g.,
          echinoderm, mammal, insect, mollusk (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">m4</NUMEX>), or protist,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungus</ENAMEX>, animal, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">m7</NUMEX>). The only exception was an ORF
          in quartet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">m7</TIMEX> that encodes the cytochrome oxidase subunit
          II. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> did not support grouping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with the
          fungal homolog as expected; rather it grouped the protist
          and animal homologs together (posterior probability
          according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">» 0.99</NUMEX>). Inspection of the
          aligned sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) revealed that there are more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX> shared between the homologs from 
          Cafeteria roenbergensis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> thanbetween the
          homologs from 
          Cafeteria roenbergensis and 
          Arabidopsis thaliana . No artifact
          that could be responsible for this unexpected grouping
          was detected. The same high support for this unexpected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> is also recovered in bootstrap analysis and in
          posterior probabilities calculated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
          .
          The finding of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> in a mitochondrial genome
          quartet that supports a non-traditional grouping could
          either reflect a rare recombination event, selection
          pressures that led to convergent evolution in two
          lineages, or a chance event - if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks at enough
          samples one will find some that (considered by
          themselves) appear significant. At present it is not
          possible to decide between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible
          explanations. Our analysis of mitochondrial genomes shows
          that in most instances the calculated probabilities
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX>-mapping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values) support the expected tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX>,
          albeit with surprisingly strong support values. Rarely,
          unexpected groupings can be recovered and support for
          these probably erroneous groupings can be high. In most
          instances the ML-mapping approach accurately revealed the
          expected relationships between the mitochondrial genomes.
          This confirms the suitability of this approach in genome
          analyses.
        
        
          Interphylum genome quartets
          Here we focus on examples that illustrate the utility
          of the probability mapping approach. Focusing on the
          relationships between the cyanobacteria with other
          bacterial phyla we calculated several genome quartets
          that include the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> each of other bacterial phyla (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In
          all cases that included both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC Gram positives</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>., the majority of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> supported the topologies that grouped these two
          organisms together. The alternative topologies were
          significantly supported by some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>, but the number
          of strongly supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> was lower than for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> - 
          Synechocystis grouping. This also
          was true when one of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomes was from a
          high GC Gram positive (genome quartets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#53</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#54</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#55</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#68</NUMEX>). Only when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two low</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GC Gram</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">positives</ENAMEX> were included
          in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX>, was the intra-phylum grouping of low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX> positives supported by many more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> than
          the grouping of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> quartets
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#51 and #52</NUMEX>).
          Previous analyses based on a limited number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and signature insertions and deletions had
          suggested different bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>
          to cyanobacteria. Among the suggested sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcales</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] and spirochetes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] . Our
          analyses do not support these earlier claims, but are in
          agreement with the recent analyses of genes involved in
          chlorophyll biosynthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , which indicated that
          the low GC Gram positive heliobacteria are closest to the
          last common ancestor of all oxygenic photosynthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>. The analyses summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2also
          illustrate that interphylum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, while turning genomes
          into mosaics, has not eroded all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phyla</ENAMEX>. In the case of cyanobacteria, a close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between</NUMEX> low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC Gram positives</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> is supported by the majority of conserved
          genes. Similar observations of reproducible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
          between phyla based on genome wide comparisons were
          recently published [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . However, at present
          it cannot be decided to what extent these closer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> reflects shared ancestry or are due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferred HGT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Interdomain genome quartets
          In our search for the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>-phylum" to the
          cyanobacteria we also analyzed a few quartets including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. One noteworthy finding was that in the genome
          quartet including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Synechocystis sp.,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Halobacterium sp.,</ENAMEX> 
          Aquifex aeolicus and 
          Thermotoga maritima the grouping of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. was recovered by
          many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> .99</NUMEX>) than the grouping
          that would be expected following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA phylogeny (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          QuartOPs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.99</NUMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). To test if this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> was specific for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>., we repeated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> replacing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> . The result was
          qualitatively the same: at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.99</NUMEX> level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> supported grouping 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>., and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 27</NUMEX>
          supported grouping 
          Aquifex aeolicus with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          Clearly, there are many artifacts possible in
          analyzing divergent sequences. For many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> the
          ortholog from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. is expected to be
          the longest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>. To test for the possibility that long
          branch attraction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] might be the reason for the
          strong support of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. grouping with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>., we repeated the
          analysis replacing the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. genome with that
          from 
          Archaeoglobus fulgidus , another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeon</ENAMEX>. Gratifyingly, many more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> supported the
          grouping of the thermophilic archaeon 
          Archaeoglobus with the thermophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacteria</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga</ENAMEX> . The different
          interdomain genome quartets that include a meso- or
          thermophilic archaeon are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
          An analysis of the putative functional assignments of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that grouped 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. with the
          mesophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. To assess which
          of these categories have an increased percentage of
          QuartOPs as compared to distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> within the
          genome, we also calculated the distributions of ORFs
          among functional categories in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. and 
          A. fulgidus genomes. Open reading
          frames within a genome are distributed almost evenly
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> meta-categories (see columns labeled "H"
          and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A"</ENAMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the
          halobacterial orthologs with those from mesophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> are distributed differentially among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-categories. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> are in the
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Metabolism</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Storage and Processing</ENAMEX>"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-categories. These are also the categories in which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. shows many more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OuartOPs</ENAMEX> in support of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">topology 3</ENAMEX> than 
          A. fulgidus .
          The analyses described in this section reconfirm that
          genes have been transferred across domain boundaries [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Not surprisingly, these transfers
          appear to occur preferentially between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> living
          in the same or similar environment. The genome of the
          mesophilic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. contains many
          genes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the orthologs from mesophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, whereas the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the
          thermophilic archaeon 
          Archaeoglobus fulgidus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with
          the orthologs from the extremely thermophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the halobacterial
          orthologs with the ortholog from the mesophilic bactria
          belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four meta</NUMEX>-categories: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Processing</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Metabolism"</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Storage and Processing meta</ENAMEX>-category that
          support the grouping of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. with 
          Synechocystis/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus</ENAMEX> are listed
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. A complete listing is available in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> material. As expected, this list includes
          several tRNA synthetases, which were previously found to
          be frequently transferred [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , and enzymes
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cf .</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ). More surprisingly,
          this list also includes translation initiation factors
          and several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>. The latter were assumed
          to be infrequently transferred, but recent analyses
          reported them to be horizontally transferred among
          bacterial lineages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The initiation factor IF-2
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. was previously
          shown to have strong similarity to the initiation factor
          IF-2 from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Most of the genes that group 
          Halobacterium with the mesophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria encode</ENAMEX> functions that were postulated to be
          frequently exchanged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . While no meta-category
          appears exempt from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, some functions appear to be more
          often transferred than others (cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).

        Conclusions
        Maximum likelihood mapping is a useful tool for
        analyzing and depicting the mosaic nature of genomes.
        ML-mapping is much less conservative than other approaches
        of estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities. If
        ML-mapping is used as the only probability mapping tool,
        the overestimation of supporting probabilities has to be
        taken into consideration. A posterior probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.99</NUMEX>
        calculated with ML-mapping often corresponds to a posterior
        probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only .90</NUMEX>.
        Many relationships among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> cannot be depicted
        by a tree-like pattern reflecting a core of rarely
        transferred genes. Rather prokaryotic genomes are mosaics
        where different parts have different evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">histories</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> between divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> has not
        erased all patterns of interphylum relationship. For
        example, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the cyanobacteria
        with the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX> positives as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> phyla.
        Due to horizontal gene transfer even organisms from
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> living in the same or similar
        environments share more genes with each other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with a similar degree of divergence that live in
        different environments. These interdomain horizontal
        transfers mainly concern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in nucleotide,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbohydrate</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport and metabolism;
        however, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are part of the translation
        machinery or are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair appear to be
        transferred across domain boundaries as well.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Data</ENAMEX>
          Completed genomes were retrieved from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>'s FTP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">site ftp://ncbi.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/genbank/genomes/</ENAMEX>in the form
          of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> encoded by open reading frames
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>) as identified in the annotated genomes.
          Mitochondrial genomes were obtained from the Organelle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genomes Page</ENAMEX> at NCBI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/PMGifs/Genomes/euk_o.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
          The genomes were formatted using the 
          formatdb program from the
          stand-alone BLAST package, initially of version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0.11</NUMEX>
          and later of versions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2.1</NUMEX> as they were
          released [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . All analyses were performed
          locally.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Flow</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quartet Analyses</ENAMEX>
          For each set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genomes, BLAST [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] searches
          of every ORF in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genome against the other three
          genomes were performed using the 
          blastp program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value cutoff
          for the BLAST searches was set to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>(in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test case
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 -20was</NUMEX> used). For every BLAST
          search the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> number of the top hit (if it was below the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cutoff</ENAMEX>) was saved along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> number of the query
          sequence forming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI pair</ENAMEX>. This resulted in twelve lists
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> pairs for each of the twelve possible pairwise
          genome comparisons. This information was further used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identify</ENAMEX> quartets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>).
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tatusov et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] we defined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> as
          those sets of genes that mutually pick each other as the
          top scoring hit in the BLAST comparisons. The detection
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX> database
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">software http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mysql</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. The lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> pairs were
          entered into twelve tables of a database. The tables were
          joined into one table under conditions that satisfy the
          definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> (see above). This resulted in
          a table with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI numbers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX>. The
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> were retrieved from
          GenBank at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> and were aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> 1.8 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          ] . QuartOPs were analyzed using the ML-mapping approach
          according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Haeseler</ENAMEX>, Bayesian
          probabilities mapping and bootstrap support values
          mapping techniques (see details below).
        
        
          Posterior probabilities according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and

          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> possible unrooted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topologies
          maximum-likelihood values and posterior probabilities
          were calculated using in-house JAVA programs that were
          written utilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogenetic Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> version 1.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vanilla</ENAMEX> package
          version 1.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . If not indicated otherwise,
          likelihood values were estimated using the automatically
          selected suitable substitution model (chosen from
          BLOSUM62, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPREV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dayhoff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MTREV24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAG</ENAMEX>) with
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ASRV</ENAMEX>. The maximum-likelihood mapping approach was
          further used to visualize support for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , i.e. the posterior probability vector for each
          QuartOP was plotted into an equilateral triangle.
          Maximum-likelihood maps were generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNUPlot</ENAMEX> v.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posterior Probabilities</ENAMEX> calculated with MrBayes
          program
          Posterior probabilities were also calculated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> version 2.01 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> was analyzed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> cycles
          under the JTT substitution model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASRV</ENAMEX>. One
          chain was heated with the temperature set equal to the
          default value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>. Samples were taken at each cycle.
          The "burn in" option was set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. The
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> were used to calculate posterior
          probabilities for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX>. The
          posterior probabilities were plotted to equilateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triangle</ENAMEX> as described above. For discussion of the choice
          of the parameters see below.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bootstrap Support Values</ENAMEX>
          As an alternative to posterior probability vectors,
          bootstrap support values were calculated and plotted.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> was bootstrapped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times and the
          proportion of bootstrapped datasets supporting each tree
          topology was recorded as a bootstrap probability vector.
          The bootstrap probability vectors were plotted into an
          equilateral triangle with the zones changed to "total",
          "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>" and "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>" (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> from mitochondrial genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>m1
          was analyzed multiple times with different parameters.
          According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Haeseler</ENAMEX>'s approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> has posterior probabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.76</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>. In all runs samples were taken at each cycle;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and the JTT substitution model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASRV</ENAMEX> were used.
          First, we analyzed the dataset with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. We
          tried different "burn in" options in the range of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>. The posterior probability values changed by
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX> from case to case. We selected a "burn in"
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> in further analyses. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we tried
          different numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> to calculate posterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities</ENAMEX>. The probabilities were calculated using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with increment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>.
          Again, the posterior probability values did not change
          significantly from case to case. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we raised the
          "temperature" parameter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, heated
          chain. This did not result in changes of the estimated
          posterior probabilities. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> cycles
          and repeated the analysis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times, calculating average
          and standard deviation of all runs. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          probabilities the standard deviation was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.01</NUMEX>.
          Based on these analyses we selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with a
          "burn in" of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> as a compromise between precision of
          probability estimation and computational time spent. As a
          final test, we performed the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>
          twice with selected parameters. This did not result in
          significantly different maps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphs</ENAMEX> and tables depicting
          the results of these analyses are given in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> material.
        
        
          Mapping taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ASRV</ENAMEX> into account
          For the genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> we calculated posterior
          probabilities under the model which takes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ASRV</ENAMEX> into
          account with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Haeseler</ENAMEX>'s [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] approach
          and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> program version 2.01 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TREE-PUZZLE 5.0</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] was used to calculate posterior
          probabilities according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strimmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Haeseler</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] . A discrete approximation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> ] was used to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASRV</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> rate categories
          were used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TREE-PUZZLE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rate
          categories were used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MrBayes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The maps are
          available in the supplementary material. Due to the
          amount of time required for calculations, the analyses
          were not performed for other genome quartets.
        
        
          Functional assignments using the COG
          database
          Datasets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> with strong preference for a
          particular tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topology</ENAMEX> (i.e. with posterior probability
          above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> for that particular topology, or in other words
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> located in the very corners of the
          equilateral triangle) were extracted. For each of those
          QuartOPs the COG functional category [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] was
          identified. In order to detect the functional categories,
          the COG database was downloaded from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTP</ENAMEX> site

          release). The COG database was formatted using the 
          formatdb program of BLAST package.
          Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuartOP</ENAMEX> was compared to the COG database using the 
          blastp program. The category of the
          each sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOP</ENAMEX> was assigned according to
          the category of the top hit of each BLAST search. The
          numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuartOPs</ENAMEX> in each functional category were
          calculated for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX>.

          Every predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> in a genome was compared to the
          COG database (release of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2001</TIMEX>) using the 
          blastp program with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value cutoff
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>. The category of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was set to be equal to
          the category of the top hit of the corresponding BLAST
          search. Category Q was dropped from the results, because
          the corresponding genome quartets were analyzed with the
          previous release of the COG database (release of year
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) that did not contain the Q category.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis Automation</ENAMEX>
          The repetitive tasks of analyses were automated using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX> package version 0.824 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The tasks that
          were not available through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX> package were programmed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERL</ENAMEX> v. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.005</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERL</ENAMEX> scripts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> programs are
