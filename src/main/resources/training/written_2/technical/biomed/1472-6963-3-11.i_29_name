        Providing information tailored to the specific needs of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> permits informed decision-making. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] However,
        patient participation in health care decision-making may be
        compromised if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> rely solely on verbal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> may forget or
        misunderstand spoken information. Or, they may not get all
        their questions answered, leaving them less able to make an
        informed decision. And, there may be substantial variation
        in the quantity and nature of information given to patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preoperatively</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        Patient well-being may be improved by providing an
        educational pamphlet, video, or audiotape preoperatively. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] The Internet has become an increasingly important
        medium for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seeking a wide variety of health
        information. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] Even though the quality of the
        information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> needs to improve, medical
        information on a web site can be updated at low cost. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alternatively</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can be sent customized
        educational information via e-mail.
        The value of the Internet to deliver medical information
        to patients having surgery would especially increase if a
        lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> existed in the questions that patients
        want answered preoperatively. This is because unlike
        traditional patient information tools (such as a brochure
        or a video where only a limited amount of preoperative
        information can be provided), a Web site could be
        structured to address the particular questions an
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might have.
        Our hypothesis was that a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of questions is
        not sufficient to meet all the preoperative information
        needs of a particular surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. We chose to study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> considering undergoing total hip arthroplasty
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX>) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) because we are
        formalizing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> education program for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX> also deserve study as they are commonly
        performed, and provide substantial improvements in quality
        of life due to reduced pain and greater mobility. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ]
        To date, however, there are few data on the particular
        information needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> considering joint replacement
        surgery, and which of these needs deserves highest
        priority. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] A study of a broad range of patient and
        procedures found that preoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> include: pain
        they might experience afterwards (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), whether
        the surgery would improve their condition (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX>), and
        whether they would fully recover from the surgery (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>). [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX> or THA, semi-structured interviews of German
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> found that they were more interested in
        information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and recovery (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> each)
        than about risks (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>). [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        The goal of this study was to have patients considering
        undergoing either total hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> or TKA rate the importance
        of different questions concerning their care. Then, the
        optimal method of communicating these information needs can
        be studied.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of question items for survey
          instrument
          We assembled an initial list of questions that might
          be important to patients having joint replacement surgery
          through informal discussions between the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> scheduled to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> scheduled to
          have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> orthopaedic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeons</ENAMEX>. The list produced by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> was
          augmented by analyzing the results of a computerized
          literature search (MEDLINE) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989-2001</TIMEX> using the
          following terms: "patient information, information needs,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX>." This search yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> relevant published
          articles (a sample of these studies is included in the
          references) which were read by the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> to
          generate other potential questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might have.
          For example, one study found that pain immediately after
          surgery, length of recovery, ability to walk, and ability
          to return to recreational activities were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> most
          important concerns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> or TKA. [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ]
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> then qualitatively edited (e.g., similar
          questions were eliminated) the list to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          items. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main criteria used to determine this final
          list were to ensure that significant elements of care
          were included, and to keep the number of questions low
          enough so as not to make the survey take longer than 12
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to complete. Each question expressed one idea and
          no question was phrased in a negative tense (i.e., not or
          neither). The survey instrument was written at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a sixth</NUMEX>
          grade reading level, as assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flesch-Kincaid</ENAMEX>
          method.
          The final written questionnaire instrument was
          organized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parts. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was the informed
          consent. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> asked for basic demographic data. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> part instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to judge the importance of
          addressing each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> questions with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> point Likert
          scale from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> (least important) - 5 (most important).
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were given the following
          instructions: " 
          Please rate how important it is to you
          that these questions be answered fully ." The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> also allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to write in any other
          questions that they might have. Pilot testing suggested
          that completion of the survey required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s time. The actual survey is
          available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMC</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">660</ENAMEX> bed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> affiliated, tertiary
          care medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,000</NUMEX> surgical cases/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> greater than 18 years of age seen by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          orthopaedic surgeons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Orthopedic Clinic</ENAMEX>
          for evaluation for hip or knee replacement surgery were
          eligible to participate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> unable to speak or read
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or with cognitive disabilities were excluded.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-month period</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          refused to participate) considering undergoing joint
          replacement surgery were selected randomly by
          computer-generated tables. No announcements or fliers
          were used to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          regularly scheduled office consultation, a trained
          research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> approached the eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
          described the study, and asked if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
          interested in participating.
          If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> agreed, he or she was asked to complete
          the written questionnaire. Subjects provided consent by
          returning the completed survey. The identity of the
          patient was not recorded, and no data was collected from
          medical records, billing records, or any clinical or
          research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">databases</ENAMEX>. The research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> was available
          to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> completing the survey.
          In order to increase sample size, we also obtained
          survey data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> knee replacement surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>
          refused to participate) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> hip replacement surgery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> refused to participate) seen by one
          orthopedic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> at a community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice clinic</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Since the question importance data were not normally
          distributed, a question's importance was ranked based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medians</ENAMEX>.
          We also quantified agreement (or disagreement) in
          responses by determining the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
          that answered each question similarly. For example, let's
          assume that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> answered a question with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          possible answers 1 (least important) - 5 (most
          important)). If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> answered "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">4"</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> patient
          answered "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> answered "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1"</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          answered "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">5"</ENAMEX>, the agreement percentage equaled 6/10
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>). To quantify variability in answers, we also
          computed the percentage of answers that were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or more
          units different than the overall median for that
          question. In the example above, this would equal 1/10
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        Patient characteristics from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> were
        similar. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
        The survey results from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> locations were
        combined because a) for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the questions the median
        scores were equal between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, b) the difference in
        medians equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the questions, and c) the
        difference in medians equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of
        questions.
        The following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> questions were rated as most important
        with a median score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at both
        sites: Will the surgery affect my abilities to care for
        myself? Am I going to need physical therapy? How mobile
        will I be after my surgery? When will I be able to walk
        normally again? (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>)
        However, overall there was disagreement on question
        importance. For example, the mean percentage disagreement
        among all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> questions was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Some questions that overall had high median scores for
        importance were rated by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to be of low
        importance, and vice a versa. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3and 4</ENAMEX>)
        For example, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> questions rated highest with a
        median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, there was at least one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patient</ENAMEX> (total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> questions
        that rated it a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 or less</NUMEX>. Overall, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>
        of all the questions answered (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> questions multiplied
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 or more</NUMEX> units different than the
        overall median for that question.
        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of all the questions answered (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> questions multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or more
        units different than the overall median for that question.
        For example, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> questions rated the lowest (median
        score of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 or less</NUMEX>), there was a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-6</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for each question that rated it a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> studied were also asked to list other questions
        that they might want answered besides those on the
        questionnaire. No single question was suggested by more
        than one respondent. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>)
      
      
        Discussion
        We found that there was enough agreement to define a
        core set of questions that should be addressed with most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> considering undergoing either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TKA</ENAMEX> or THA. These
        questions rated to be of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> related to whether
        the surgery affected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s ability to care for
        themselves, whether they would need physical therapy, and
        how mobile (i.e., able to walk again) they would be after
        surgery.
        However, each of the remaining questions in our survey
        was also judged to be of highest importance to some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> wrote on the questionnaire other
        questions they wanted answered. This finding of variability
        in patient preferences is similar to other studies. For
        example, although avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>/vomiting and incision
        pain are high priorities for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after surgery,
        there is important variability on how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rate
        different postoperative outcomes. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        The difficulty in finding homogeneity in information
        needs suggests that the database of information required
        for education of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing joint replacement
        surgery cannot be reduced, because each piece of
        information was necessary to some. Providing core
        information to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> plus education tailored to an
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s requests may be a way to address
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in patient information needs.
        Perhaps this is one reason that Web sites have become
        available to deliver information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        Increasingly, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have Internet access. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> study of cancer screening found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had home Internet access and a further <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> had web
        access from other sources. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty-six percent</NUMEX> of
        orthopedic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> had access to the web. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> studies have found similar rates of Internet access. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ]
        A single Web site is part of a larger net of information
        so that a topic not covered by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Web page may be covered
        by another, via links. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] Future studies need to be
        designed to determine if in-depth, and evidence-based
        educational information available via a web site is better
        at accommodating preoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> education than paper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> or videos given out in the waiting room prior to the
        patient seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> would have to reach consensus on the content of "easy
        to understand" answers for each question. Some of the
        questions may be difficult to address due to lack of clear
        evidence.
        As in most studies in health care, our subject sample
        depended on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' willingness to participate and the
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> studied. The
        potential for selection bias was minimized, to the extent
        possible by sampling a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of various ages,
        gender, ethnicities, and education levels. Since our sample
        were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that were in the final decision making period
        about undergoing surgery, information about risks was not
        included in the list presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, although it
        did come up in the additional questions suggested by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who are not sure whether or not they
        wish to undergo these treatments are likely to be more
        interested in knowing about the risks, than those who have
        already made the decision. For example, some patients
        mentioned a need to know about infection rates and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeon</ENAMEX>'s qualifications and previous experience with
        performing this procedure. This additional information
        would likely be needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> deciding whether or not
        to have surgery.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The content and relative importance of information that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKA</ENAMEX> or THA need is unclear. Since the
        trend is for more Internet based education, we wanted to
        know what questions to address on our web site to provide
        better individualized information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> before
        surgery. We found that although there was enough agreement
        to define a core set of questions that should be addressed
        with most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> deemed suitable for the procedure by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeon</ENAMEX>, some of the remaining questions were also
        considered highly important by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The core set
        of information, therefore, would not be adequate to satisfy
        any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s essential information needs. It may be
        that the Web offers a flexible medium for informing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and accommodating their variety of needs.
