          Modeling variable DNA sequence sites
          The set of binding sites for a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be highly variable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], and the degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> variation tolerated generally differs from
          position to position within a site [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. This
          sequence diversity can have important functional
          consequences as the affinity between regulatory proteins
          and their binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is modulated by changes in
          binding-site sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Large datasets of related DNA
          sites are now available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Currently, more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes have been
          completely sequenced, permitting cross-species
          comparisons of even larger sequence assemblies than
          collected here (see, for example [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]). Computational
          approaches can therefore be used to detect and model the
          sequence patterns present within the binding-site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. The most useful models of variable DNA sites
          provide classification algorithms for identifying
          functional sites as well as insights that can help
          elucidate the relationship between the structure and
          function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
          Variable DNA sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are frequently described
          by a consensus sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] or a weight matrix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. Consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> have limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for
          even moderately variable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> because they preserve
          little or no information about the variability within the
          sequences they characterize. Differences from consensus
          are quantified by counting the number of mismatched
          positions, making no distinction between mismatches that
          abolish function of the site and those that modulate
          function.
          Weight matrices were introduced to characterize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and translation initiation sites in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] and have
          become standard for characterizing binding sites for
          transcription factors. A weight matrix is a
          two-dimensional matrix in which each row corresponds to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides and each column corresponds
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position in the site being described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the matrix are the observed counts for each
          nucleotide at each position in an alignment of the DNA
          sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], or some function of these counts (reviewed
          in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]). Any sequence can be scored by summing the
          matrix elements corresponding to the sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>],
          thereby quantitatively rating the sequence's functional
          potential.
          Weight matrices can be used to scan genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
          determine statistically significant matches to the
          sequence pattern described by the matrix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Putative
          sites are scored by the weight matrix, so the number of
          false positives and false negatives can be balanced by
          choosing an appropriate threshold score defining
          functional sites. The scores of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
          sometimes correlated with their level of function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23</TIMEX>].
          Weight matrices are typically based on order zero
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, meaning they assume that individual base
          pairs in the binding site affect binding affinity
          independently. Weight-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">matrix models</ENAMEX> based on order one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> assume that adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 24, 25, 26, 27</TIMEX>]. Ponomarenko 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] constructed weight
          matrices for many different transcription factor binding
          sites using mono-, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di-</ENAMEX>, and trinucleotide motifs allowing
          correlation between non-adjacent positions by specifying
          X 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> NX 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 and X</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> NX 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> NX 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> motifs, where X 
          i is the nucleotide at position i of
          the motif and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is any nucleotide. While this approach
          allows for correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> non-adjacent
          positions, the motifs may still be unnecessarily
          restrictive. The apposition of distant binding-site
          positions can be important to recruitment of the binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, for example, through formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> secondary
          structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>], or to the interaction of the
          binding site with its binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Therefore
          correlation between distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> is expected.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karlin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] used hypothesis testing via Ï‡
          2tests to detect significant correlations between any two
          positions and introduced a model-building procedure,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">maximal</ENAMEX> dependence decomposition, to account for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dependencies</ENAMEX>. For each significant correlation, this
          method partitions the dataset into subsets of sequences
          exhibiting no correlation; the final model is a composite
          of weight matrices (order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>), one for each subset. Our
          model-building technique is based on cross-validation
          criteria rather than on hypothesis testing 
          per se , and we use a more general
          model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>.
          Models that allow for pairwise correlations between
          positions were developed in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayes</ENAMEX> networks
          by Cai 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Bayes networks
          represent a large class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and in fact, our model
          can be recast as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, although it is not now
          formulated in those terms.
          We have developed an approach to determine the
          correlation structure present in a set of variable
          sequence sites. For each position in the site, we
          identify all other correlated positions placing no
          restrictions on the number or spatial relationship of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> positions in the site. Our approach
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">determines</ENAMEX>, from all possible combinations of disjoint
          probability distributions, the set of distributions that
          most effectively distinguishes functional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> from
          non-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of models
          we consider is very large, we proceed by model selection
          rather than hypothesis testing. The selected probability
          function is the product of these disjoint probability
          distributions. The natural logarithm of this probability
          function can be used as a score for any sequence, thereby
          recognizing the presence of evolutionarily conserved
          nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. We have applied this approach to
          recombination signal sequences (RSS), a set of DNA
          binding sites necessary for specific immunity.
        
        
          Recombination signal sequences
          Specific immunity depends on the ability of B and T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> to recognize antigens, molecular identifiers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The immune system does not anticipate
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> will be encountered, but remarkable genetic
          mechanisms have evolved that generate diverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-receptor repertoires</ENAMEX>. The primary generative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanism is V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination, the rearrangement of
          B-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (BCR) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>) V, D, and
          J gene segments to form functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; the resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combinatorial</ENAMEX> and junctional diversity can produce around
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 14BCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specificities</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18TCR</ENAMEX> specificities
          in one animal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. This extraordinary plasticity has a
          price: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination can produce self-reactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> leading to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>] and may
          err to create oncogenic chromosomal translocations [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination proceeds by the introduction of
          double-strand DNA breaks (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]). To prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> breaks that would cause cellular damage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX>
          recombinase must be specifically targeted to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bcr</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tcr</ENAMEX> loci. This targeting is
          regulated primarily by binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAG1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], an enzyme
          in the recombinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> adjacent to each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> gene segment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> were initially
          identified as a conserved heptamer (consensus CACAGTG)
          and a conserved nonamer (consensus ACAAAAACC) separated
          by a less conserved spacer of either <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Â± 1 or 23 Â±</NUMEX> 1
          base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. The initial CAC of the heptamer is
          highly conserved, but all remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> show
          moderate to very low levels of conservation (reviewed in
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> variability has important functional consequences:
          the efficiency with which each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> mediates recombination
          depends on its sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. There is strong evidence
          that differing recombination efficiencies of RSS result
          in the biased utilization of their associated gene
          segments (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47, 48</TIMEX>]). In addition, the biases
          in gene segment use observed in the post-selection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
          repertoire are consistent with the biases observed before
          selection, suggesting that the primary immune repertoire
          may be genetically patterned [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
          The high level of diversity among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> makes it very
          difficult to evaluate their recombinogenic potential. RSS
          not associated with a V, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> gene segment but
          participating in aberrant (illegitimate) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX>
          recombination are particularly difficult to recognize.
          These non-physiologic RSS are important because of their
          potential involvement in oncogenic chromosomal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor editing</ENAMEX>, a process that alters
          the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoreactive receptors</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Non-physiologic RSS</ENAMEX> that have simply arisen by chance can
          be referred to as fortuitous RSS whereas those thought to
          have descended from the same ancient transposon as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic RSS</ENAMEX> can be referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as cryptic</NUMEX> (cRSS) [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. Generally, the origin of a non-physiologic RSS
          is not known; for simplicity, we will refer to both types
          as cryptic.
          To understand the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> variability in the
          formation of the primary immune repertoire and of cRSS in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illegitimate V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombination, it is necessary to
          quantify the genetic variability among physiologic RSS
          and the relationship between this variability and the
          regulation of recombination. Allowing for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          nucleotides at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 10</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 or 39</TIMEX> RSS positions
          results in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10</NUMEX> 6different signals - it is not
          feasible to measure the efficiency of all potential RSS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> variability
          that allow prediction of recombination efficiency are
          essential to furthering our understanding of the
          biological function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> variability.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> estimate of cRSS frequency in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> bp [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. Promiscuous recombination at
          this frequency, however, would result in significant
          damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. This suggests that complex patterns
          underlie the high level of nucleotide diversity observed
          at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>, thereby increasing the
          specificity of the signal governing recruitment of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombinase.
          We find significant correlations between nucleotide
          positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, suggesting they act cooperatively and
          that nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are conserved. We used our
          model selection procedure to determine the best models of
          RSS correlation structure, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> model for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-bp spacer</NUMEX> RSS
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS) and one for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS. We also modeled both types
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> with order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. The
          scores from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are highly correlated with
          measured recombination efficiencies, but the models
          arising from our technique are much better than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> at identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologic</ENAMEX> and cryptic RSS
          in genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouse RSS</ENAMEX> show limited sequence conservation
          We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologic</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSS</ENAMEX> (see Methods).
          While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">219/356</NUMEX>) of these RSS contain a consensus
          heptamer, just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">57/356</NUMEX>) contain a consensus nonamer
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48/356</NUMEX>) contain both a consensus heptamer
          and a consensus nonamer. To measure the level of
          nucleotide diversity at individual RSS positions, we
          computed the entropy ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] for each position 
          i in an alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201 12</NUMEX>-RSS
          and an alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155 23</NUMEX>-RSS (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). A
          strictly conserved position in which no variation is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerated</ENAMEX> has 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 0</ENAMEX>, while a position in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides
          are observed at nearly uniform frequencies has 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 1</ENAMEX>.
          The signal specified by the individual RSS positions
          is very low, especially in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The
          average entropy is 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS; for a randomly
          generate string of A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, C, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, the
          expected value for is one. The patterns of nucleotide
          diversity at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are similar for both
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS: the initial CAC of the heptamer is
          invariant, the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> of the heptamer
          are moderately diverse, the spacer is highly diverse, and
          the A tract of the nonamer (positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) is
          better conserved than the other nonamer positions (Figure
          1a). The average entropy for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> is higher than for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS, primarily because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS nonamers are much
          more diverse than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS nonamers ( 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX>; 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>).
          It is known from experimental studies that nucleotide
          substitutions at highly diverse positions influence
          recombination efficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 52</TIMEX>]. That a given RSS
          position can be both highly variable and exhibit strong
          effects on signal efficiency appears contradictory. The
          contradiction can be reconciled, however, by
          hypothesizing correlations between nucleotides in RSS: a
          nucleotide substitution at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position may be
          compensated for by a change at another position in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Significant pairwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX> exist between
          positions in the RSS
          To test for correlation between pairs of positions in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, we computed the mutual information, 
          MI 
          
          i , 
          i  , [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] between all pairs of
          positions 
          i and 
          i ' in an alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologic</ENAMEX> mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and in an alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologic</ENAMEX> mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS (see Methods) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
          Statistically significant 
          MI 
          
          i , 
          i ' values result when there is
          a correlation between nucleotide frequencies at the two
          positions, indicating selection pressure to maintain (or
          avoid) a particular dinucleotide.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, we detect statistically significant
          correlations between positions in those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the
          RSS exhibiting high levels of position-wise entropy.
          These are the spacer, especially the nonamer-proximal
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, and the positions of the heptamer and nonamer that
          are adjacent to the spacer (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). In general,
          correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions decreases as a function
          of distance, but there are examples of strong correlation
          between widely separated positions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). For
          example, we observe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS with A at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 and 19</TIMEX>
          at a much higher frequency (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.38</NUMEX>) than expected (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.11</NUMEX>)
          from the independent frequencies of A at each position.
          In addition, we find that the levels of correlation are
          higher in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS than in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>); this is an
          especially interesting observation given that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS are
          much more variable than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> models of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS determine the
          relevant correlation structure
          The 
          MI computations give evidence for
          strong pairwise correlations, including between distant
          positions, and correlations may exist between any number
          of positions. We therefore developed statistical models,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and one for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, that can account for
          correlations between arbitrary positions without regard
          for their distance from each other or the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> positions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were developed using a
          procedure that selects from all possible combinations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disjoint</ENAMEX> probability distributions the set of marginal
          (for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position) and joint (for multiple positions)
          distributions that most distinguishes physiologic RSS
          from other nucleotide sequences of the same length. For
          example, positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 and 19</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS are highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). They could be included in the
          model either through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marginal probability
          distributions - the distribution over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          nucleotides at position 8 and the distribution over the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>, or through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> joint
          probability distribution - the distribution over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          pairs of nucleotides at the pair of positions. Each model
          computes a score for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> information content: 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-bp sequences and 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39-bp sequences</NUMEX>; the formation
          of joint probability functions is determined by
          maximizing the mean score for physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>.
          The selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is:

          Most of the marginal probabilities have been merged to
          form joint probability functions, but the order in which
          the joint functions were formed reflects the relative
          strength of the correlations between the corresponding
          positions: positions with large 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> are grouped early in model
          selection (data not shown). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of positions with
          the strongest correlations are (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7,8,19</NUMEX>), (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16,17,18</NUMEX>), and
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20,21,22</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19,27,30,31,32,33,37</NUMEX>), (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8,9,21</NUMEX>), and (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7,24,25</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). For both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, the positions
          exhibiting the strongest cooperative influence lie in the
          nonamer-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">proximal half</NUMEX> of the spacer and in the heptamer
          and nonamer positions adjacent to the spacer (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, these positions overlap substantially with
          positions exhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ethylation</ENAMEX>/methylation interference
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> complexed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAG1/RAG2</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2and</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>])
          suggesting that the correlations detected by the models
          are relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAG-RSS</ENAMEX> interaction.
        
        
          The selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were compared with order zero
          and order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> models
          To determine whether the correlation structure
          detected by our model selection procedure improves RSS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> and evaluation, we constructed weight matrix
          models based on order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>.
          Order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> ( 
          WM0 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and 
          WM0 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS) assume that all RSS
          positions are independent and are therefore computed from
          marginal probability distributions. The score for an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -bp sequence is computed as
          
          where 
          P 
          
            i 
           is the probability of observing nucleotide 
          X at position

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> and 
          WM1 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ) assume that adjacent positions
          are correlated (the identity of the nucleotide at
          position 
          i depends on the nucleotide at
          position 
          i - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and are computed from
          conditional probability distributions:
          
          where 
          P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is the marginal probability
          distribution for position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          i | 
          i - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is the probability of
          observing nucleotide 
          X at position 
          i given the nucleotide at position 
          i - 1.
          For physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, the score distribution
          is shifted toward higher scores for models that include
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> and 
          WM1 ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          difference is most striking for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The mean scores for the physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS are 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-19.84</NUMEX>, 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-18.49</NUMEX>, and 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-18.47</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>); the mean scores
          for physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS are 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-37.07</NUMEX>, 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-31.51</NUMEX>, and 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-32.39</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). There is
          relatively little change in the value of low scores
          across models, so as the correlation structure of the
          models increases in complexity, the increase in high
          scores results in an increase in the score range (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          3and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Functional RSS</ENAMEX> are best discriminated by
          RICscores
          To test whether functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> can be recognized by
          the sequence properties captured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, we
          characterized the score distributions for non-RSS DNA
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These background distributions are
          characterized by their means and ranges. 
          WM0, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WM1</ENAMEX> and 
          RIC scores were computed for all
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28- and 39-bp</TIMEX> segments in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212,128</NUMEX>-bp fragment of mouse
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC084823</NUMEX>) containing no known RSS. We also
          characterized the background distributions by computing
          scores for a pseudorandom string (PRS) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A, T</ENAMEX>, C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          the same length as sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC084823</ENAMEX> and having the same
          nucleotide-usage frequencies.
          As expected, the 
          WM0 score distributions for
          AC084823 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRS</ENAMEX> are almost identical for both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>-bp segments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). For the models
          that account for correlation, however, scores from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are higher on average than those computed for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This is especially true for
          the 
          WM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, indicating that,
          whereas both the 
          WM1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are influenced by
          correlations present in physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the correlations
          detected by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are more specific to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the distributions for 
          RIC scores are always shifted
          toward lower scores than the corresponding 
          WM0 and 
          WM1 distributions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          We next compared across models the frequency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-length segments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC084823</TIMEX> that score above a
          given threshold. To determine test thresholds for a given
          model, we ranked the physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> by score in
          ascending order and took the lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of scores under
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as the test thresholds for that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). For example, the lowest 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-48.16</NUMEX>. It has rank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and
          zero physiologic RSS have a lower 
          RIC

          segments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC084823</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">859</NUMEX> have 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 > -48.16</TIMEX>. Similarly, threshold
          zero under the 
          WM1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-46.32</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,372</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212,101</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01118</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28-bp</TIMEX> segments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC084823</TIMEX> have 
          WM1 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 > -46.32</TIMEX>. Under each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the
          frequency of physiologic RSS scoring below threshold
          estimates the probability of failing to recognize a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional RSS</ENAMEX> and is a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s
          sensitivity. The frequency of non-RSS scoring above
          threshold estimates the probability of classifying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-RSS</ENAMEX> as functional and is a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> should be small. The
          high-scoring non-RSS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> may support recombination,
          however, and, if so, would be classified as cRSS. Those
          not supporting recombination would be counted as false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>.
          In general we find that the 
          WM0 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> predict the highest
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC084823</TIMEX>, and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> predict the fewest
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> test thresholds, there are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> does not predict the smallest
          number of RSS: for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> models, the score for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ninth</ENAMEX>-lowest ranking physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> models, the scores for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>- and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>-lowest ranking physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          From Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, we determine thresholds at which
          excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> more physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> results in a
          large drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>' predicted number of cryptic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. We select <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-38.81</NUMEX> for 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-58.45</NUMEX> for 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX>

          RIC

          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28-bp</TIMEX> segments in sequence AC084823 achieve
          
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 > -38.81</TIMEX>. The frequency of 
          RIC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 > -38.81</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRS</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> Ã—
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 -5</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21/212,102</NUMEX>). Similarly, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> physiologic
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.02</NUMEX>) have 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23 < -58.45</TIMEX>. Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> of the

          AC084823 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 58</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212,091</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> from the PRS
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>) have 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23 > -58.45</TIMEX>. We therefore set
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.81</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-58.45</NUMEX> as 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> and 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23 thresholds</TIMEX>, respectively.
        
        
          The RICmodels reliably recognize physiologic
          RSS
          We searched genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">physiologic RSS</ENAMEX> to
          determine if 
          RIC scores can resolve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X58411</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,360 bp</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X58414</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,867</NUMEX>)
          encompass the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JÎ» locus</ENAMEX> and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four 12</NUMEX>-RSS,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> associated with functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JÎ</ENAMEX>» gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the pseudogene <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JÎ»4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. We computed 
          RIC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,173</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28-bp</TIMEX> segments in
          X58411 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X58414</TIMEX>; the resulting 
          RIC 
          12 distributions are almost identical
          to that for the chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> sequence with means well
          below threshold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). The 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> for RSS associated with functional
          JÎ» gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> lie well outside this distribution
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> score <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">> -38.81</TIMEX> ( 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-21.16</NUMEX>). Analogous searches of
          mouse D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF018146</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJÎ²</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AE000665</NUMEX>)
          regions also demonstrated 
          RIC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> values for physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-RSS
          included in the search, only the RSS associated with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JÎ»4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pseudogene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] scored below threshold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Scans of the sequence containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DÎ²</ENAMEX> and JÎ² gene
          segments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AE000665</ENAMEX>, described above) and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,611</NUMEX>-bp
          sequence containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AE000663</NUMEX>) showed that
          physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS are also easily resolved by their 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> DÎ²
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS have 
          RIC 
          23 well above threshold (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35.85</NUMEX> and
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49.56</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VÎ²</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS associated with
          functional gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are also easily identified (mean
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.17</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). Again, the only RSS not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> above threshold are associated with pseudogenes [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56, 57</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VÎ² 11 -61.78; VÎ² 12-3 -61.76; VÎ² 8 -58.87</ENAMEX>);
          nevertheless, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> 
          RIC 
          23 scores fall above the background
          mean (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77.75</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> cannot be
          stringently selected, so we expect their 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> to be below threshold but above
          background.
          For comparison, we scanned the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sequences
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AE000663</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AE000665</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF018146</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X58411 and X58414</TIMEX>) using
          the 
          WM0 and 
          WM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. In all cases the mean
          score for non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> is lower than the mean score for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> RSS associated with functional gene segments,
          but the disparity between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of scores is
          always greatest for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>), showing that
          discrimination between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> is clearest using
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> models. This wider disparity
          may be important when searching for functional but
          degenerate signals such as cryptic and
          pseudogene-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>.
          
          RIC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AE000663</TIMEX> are directly
          compared with 
          WM0 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23 or</TIMEX> 
          WM1 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The majority of
          scores for non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> fall below the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = 
          x line, indicating that they
          receive lower scores under the 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> model than under either of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for RSS associated
          with functional gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> tend to fall above 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = 
          x , indicating their better
          discrimination by the 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> model (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          pseudogene-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AE000663</TIMEX>, scores for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          fall in the cloud of background scores under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          models whereas scores for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> do not
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Although the scores for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> are
          higher under both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> models than under the 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> model, they are better
          discriminated by the 
          RIC 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> because the background scores
          are higher under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          Parameters for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated from the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201 12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155 23</NUMEX>-RSS). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> contained in the search contigs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> of the RSS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with functional gene segments were part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX> set. In contrast, the pseudogene-associated

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional JÎ² RSS</ENAMEX> were not part of the estimation
          set.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICscores</ENAMEX> identify functional cryptic RSS

          the replacement of the V gene segment portion of a
          rearranged variable-region gene with an upstream V gene
          segment (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]). To test whether our model

          WM0 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. The cRSS were not part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> set
          used for parameter estimation. While the cRSS in V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S1*01</ENAMEX> and V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">14S1</ENAMEX> have higher scores than any
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-bp <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in their respective gene segments
          under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the 
          RIC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> and 
          WM0 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are better at identifying
          them because these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have lower background scores
          than the 
          WM1 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> model (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). The cRSS in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H9</TIMEX>,
          however, is best recognized by its 
          RIC 
          12 score (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). While it has a
          higher score under the 
          WM1 model, its 
          RIC 
          12 score is more separated from the
          background 
          RIC scores than its

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 or</TIMEX> 
          WM0 
          12 score (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). All

          To quantify any correlation between

        Discussion
        We developed models of the correlation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS using a model selection procedure that finds the
        models with the most power to predict the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional RSS</ENAMEX>. The procedure determines the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        positions such that the predictive power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
        increased by including the correlation between the
        positions within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Positions not correlated with
        any other position are included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> by the
        probability distribution over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides at that
        position; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of correlated positions are included by
        the probability distribution for the set of motifs
        prescribed by the number of positions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; for
        example, a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> would be modeled by the
        probability distribution for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> possible quadruplet
        motifs. The models compute an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> information content
        score, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> , for any RSS-length sequence,
        that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-bp <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are scored by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">39-bp</TIMEX> segments are scored by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        Model selection evaluates all possible combinations of
        probability distributions in a stepwise fashion, so the
        correlation structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> is not specified nor assumed,
        but rather detected. Interestingly, the positions
        exhibiting the strongest correlation overlap substantially
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> nucleotides that contact the recombinase
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2and</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]), offering support for the hypothesis
        that positions acting cooperatively to influence binding by
        the recombinase coevolve. This overlap also suggests that
        the correlation structure detected by our model selection
        procedure is relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> function.
        To determine if modeling the correlation structure
        specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> improves RSS recognition and evaluation, we
        compared the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that assume
        RSS positions are independent (order zero <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, 
        WM0 ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that assume adjacent
        positions are correlated (order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, 
        WM1 ). In general we find that, while
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> function equally well, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank correlation coefficients around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.81</NUMEX> for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.88</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are better at
        discriminating between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and non-RSS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. This is
        especially true for the degenerate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of RSS - cRSS
        and pseudogene-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>.
        Under each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we compared the score distribution for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic RSS</ENAMEX> with that for non-RSS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. We find
        that the two distributions are most disparate under the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). While
        including correlation in the models increases the scores
        for most physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), assuming adjacent
        positions are correlated increases scores nonspecifically,
        raising the background scores (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
        distribution of scores for non-RSS was approximated by
        computing the score for all RSS-length segments in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-kb
        region of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> containing no known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and also in
        a pseudorandom string of A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> the same
        length as the chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and having the same
        nucleotide-usage frequencies.
        We determined threshold scores to discriminate between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional RSS</ENAMEX> and non-RSS. The lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of scores for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic RSS</ENAMEX> under each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were used as test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX>; for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thresholds, the frequency of
        non-RSS scoring above threshold was lowest under the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We selected
        threshold 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.81</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-58.45</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS respectively), at which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 98%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> RSS score above threshold, and the predicted
        frequency of functional signals in the mouse genome is on
        the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Many of the signals identified
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may mediate recombination, and so this
        frequency overestimates the false-positive rate. The
        false-positive rate can only be estimated by testing a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sample of these putative cRSS for function.
        We show that the threshold scores can be effectively
        used to screen genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. We screened
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> physiologic RSS
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of which are not part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> set used for
        parameter estimation. Under all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the mean score for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-RSS</ENAMEX> is lower than the mean score for physiologic RSS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with functional gene segments, but the disparity
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of scores is always greatest for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three 23</NUMEX>-RSS have 
        RIC scores below their respective
        threshold scores, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pseudogene-associated RSS
        included in our search are better recognized by 
        RIC than by 
        WM0 or 
        WM1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Furthermore, we
        computed the 
        RIC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">3</ENAMEX>' â†’ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oriented</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-cRSS in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> gene segments observed to mediate
        receptor editing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, cRSS were not included in
        the estimation set. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cRSS</ENAMEX> are recognized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        models, but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is recognized only by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). We expect cRSS and
        pseudogene-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> to be under less stringent
        selection pressure than physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and therefore to
        have lost some of their sequence similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. An
        important future test of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> models will be to scan genomic
        DNA prospectively for cRSS and show that the cRSS
        identified mediate recombination by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> recombinase.
        We have successfully used the model selection procedure
        introduced here to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> and complex binding sites. An advantage of this
        procedure is that the correlation structure of the site is
        determined from the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the sequence
        set alone; therefore, the sequence properties governing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the site by the binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>(s) can be
        identified in the absence of experimental evaluation of
        function. Often there is an abundance of sequence data that
        has not yet been, or perhaps cannot be, experimentally
        evaluated. Information about the correlation structure of a
        binding site can give important insight into how the
        binding site and binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>(s) interact, and may
        suggest important experiments. In addition, by choosing the
        positions to be correlated independently of their relative
        positions, we are able to model highly complex patterns
        with a relatively reduced increase in model complexity.
        Inclusion of highly complex correlation patterns in models
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can improve the precision with which
        sites are identified and functional levels are
        predicted.

          preserve both marginal distributions but disrupt any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlations</ENAMEX>. The proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> permutations giving

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> models of RSS structure
          Single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS define the set of
          probability distributions that contain the most
          information about RSS structure. We developed the models
          by stepwise model enlargement and selection. We begin
          with the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, order zero <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> models
          estimated under the assumption of pairwise site
          independence. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> take as the probability of
          observing a sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> , the product of the individual
          marginal probabilities over the RSS positions, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) = Î  
          
            i 
           
          P 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is the nucleotide observed in
          sequence 
          S at position 
          i . The marginal probability
          distribution for a position defines the probability of
          observing each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides at that position
          and is estimated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> dataset using the Bayesian
          estimator for 
          P 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) described above. Each potential
          model enlargement is accomplished by replacing the
          product of an independent marginal probability and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k -variate</ENAMEX> joint probability by a
          corresponding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-variate joint
          probability.
          For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of model enlargement for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> of length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> compares all possible
          combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> joint probability distribution for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions and marginal probability distributions for
          the remaining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>. positions: for every pair of
          positions 
          i and 
          i ', there is the model
          
          Under each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> we compute scores by taking
          the natural logarithm of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) (ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> )) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> in the dataset
          using leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out cross-validation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. Briefly, for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we exclude <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> from the dataset, estimate
          the probability distributions used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> from the
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, and compute ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) for the excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. We
          perform this computation for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and take the
          average ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) over all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. We then select
          the combination of probability distributions giving the
          largest average ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of model enlargement expands the model
          selected in step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by comparing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          classes: those based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> joint probability
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> formed in step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and one for an
          additional pair of positions, and marginal probability
          distributions for the remaining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N - 4</ENAMEX> positions, and those based on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> joint probability distribution for a group of three
          positions, the pair joint selected in step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> expanded
          to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional position, and marginal
          probability distributions for the remaining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N - 3</ENAMEX> positions. We again compute
          ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) under each model for each RSS
          using leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out cross-validation and select the model
          giving the largest average ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ).
          We continued the step-wise model enlargement and
          selection, iteratively expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> until the
          mean ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) ceased improving. The final
          model is not necessarily optimal, however; we perform the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maximization</ENAMEX> in a step-wise manner and so, as in any
          stepwise statistical procedure, are not guaranteed to
          achieve the global maximum.
          Once the final set of probability distributions has
          been selected (the mean ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) no longer improves), the
          parameters of each probability distribution are estimated
          on the complete set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> is a value between -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âˆž</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> were strictly conserved, the consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> would have ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. We define the ln 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) of a sequence computed from the
          final model as its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> information content ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> ). The final models take the
          form:

          The CA dinucleotide at positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heptamer</ENAMEX> is required for rearrangement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 52, 68</TIMEX>].
          Therefore, the models assign a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to any
          RSS not beginning with CA.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> receive higher 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> values (and 
          WM0 and 
          WM1 values, see below) during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> searches than during model development, because
          the sequence for which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> is calculated is excluded from
          the dataset during model development, a property of
          leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out cross-validation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. In contrast,
          nucleotide frequencies used in the searches are estimated
          on the complete set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>. The difference between the
          two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIC</ENAMEX> values is greatest for rare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and, in general, the differences are larger for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS. The difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> is < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> and for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> models
          We also modeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> with weight matrices based on an
          order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]).
          The order zero <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> model assumes that all RSS
          positions are independent, so the probability of
          observing a sequence 
          S that is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -bp long is:
          
          where 
          P 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) is the probability of observing
          nucleotide 
          s at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX> position 
          i . 
          P 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) is estimated as described above
          from the set of physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS. The score for
          sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is then the natural logarithm of
          the probability 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ),
          
          The order <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> model assumes that all adjacent
          positions are correlated, so the probability of observing
          sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is based on conditional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">probabilities:</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
          i <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> ) is the probability of
          observing nucleotide 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           in position 
          i given that nucleotide 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
          i -1 occupies position 
          i - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayes</ENAMEX> rule,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ,) is the joint probability distribution for the
          dinucleotide 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
          i -1

            i 
           occurring at the pair of positions 
          i - 1 and 
          i . Again, the probability
          distributions are estimated from the physiologic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>- or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-RSS, and we take the natural logarithm of the
          probability 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) as the score for sequence
