        The B cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor</ENAMEX> (BCR) is a multi-subunit
        complex that acts as a key sensor regulating the response
        of lymphocytes to their environment (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] ). In mature B cells, activation through the BCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulates</ENAMEX> cellular proliferation and differentiation. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immature</ENAMEX> B cells, activation through the BCR induces either
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of unresponsiveness, termed anergy, or death by
        apoptosis, depending on the physical nature and
        concentration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . In some B cell lymphomas,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> can induce cell cycle arrest and
        apoptosis 
        in vitro and tumor dormancy 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . The core of
        the multi-subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> is membrane-bound immunoglobulin
        (mIg), which is non-covalently associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-receptor molecules, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD79a</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igα</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD79b</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igβ</ENAMEX>),
        products of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mb-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B29 genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> changes induced by engagement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> are
        extensive and include an increase in tyrosine
        phosphorylation of several intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, fluxes in the
        concentration of intracellular free Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, activation of
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine kinases including components of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase pathway</ENAMEX>, and changes in the activities of a
        panel of transcription factors. Although much is known
        about the biochemical changes occurring in response to
        BCR-mediated activation, the differences in the signal
        transduction pathways that give rise to the different
        cellular responses following activation of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in immature versus mature cells have yet to be
        elucidated completely (discussed in detail in refs. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        ).
        Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR
        engagement are the activation of several non-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine kinases</ENAMEX> (PTKs), including p55 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blk</ENAMEX>), p59 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fyn</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fyn</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53/56</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lyn</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Src</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Btk of the Itk</ENAMEX>/Tec family [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] and p72 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syk/ZAP-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . The importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in BCR signaling and
        lymphocyte development has been clearly demonstrated using
        gene inactivation approaches. Although 
        syk -deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> die perinatally,
        analysis of radiation chimeras reconstituted with fetal
        liver from 
        syk -deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> has demonstrated
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> in the transition from proB cells to preB cells,
        indicating that signal transduction through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> is required
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> B cell development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . Inactivation of
        the 
        syk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken DT40</ENAMEX> B cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lymphoma</ENAMEX> leads to a loss in the activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>, the
        increase in intracellular free Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and the apoptotic
        response following engagement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>. In contrast,
        BCR-mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> kinase was largely
        maintained [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>-dependent signaling pathway
        appears to be facilitated by the adaptor molecule BLNK
        (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLP-65</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASH</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> can
        induce the phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLNK</ENAMEX> in co-transfection
        experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , which may be important for the
        recruitment of other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syk</ENAMEX> substrates like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> through a
        scaffolding function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLNK</ENAMEX> function is necessary
        for signal transduction since no Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+flux or PLCγ2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is observed in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> engagement
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BLNK-deficient DT40 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        The formation of large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> complexes associated with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane receptor</ENAMEX> through specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> appears to be an early step in BCR-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction. In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> becomes non-covalently associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH2</ENAMEX> domains located in the amino terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Following engagement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>,
        phosphorylation of specific tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in
        immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)
        found within the cytoplasmic tails of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD79a</ENAMEX> and CD79b
        provides docking sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46 47</NUMEX> ] .
        The ability of phosphorylated ITAM peptides to selectively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhance Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity 
        in vitro suggests that recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may serve to activate the
        kinase, in part, through allosteric changes in the
        structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 48 49</NUMEX> ] . Upon
        activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> become localized
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-resistant cholesterol-rich membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microdomains</ENAMEX> (lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rafts</ENAMEX>), resulting in the segregation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> from other membrane components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] .
        In this report, we describe the use of a mutant form of
        Syk that leads to the constitutive activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous wildtype Syk</ENAMEX> kinase when introduced into B cells
        - a dominant positive effect - in the absence of detectable
        tyrosine phosphorylation. It was anticipated that the
        presence of a constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> enzyme could help
        in delineating the signaling events that occur upstream and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downstream of Syk</ENAMEX> activation in the BCR signal transduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. However, although these cells carry a highly
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase, no evidence for downstream signaling was
        found. These data indicate that activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase
        enzymatic activity in cells is insufficient for signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> engagement induces apoptosis and Syk
          activation
          Stimulation through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> has been shown to induce
          changes in cell growth and viability in several B cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, including the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Daudi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken DT40</ENAMEX> and
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WEHI-231</ENAMEX> and BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.3B3</TIMEX> B cell lymphomas [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19 27 38</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53</NUMEX> ] . For example, stimulation of BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> .3B3 through the BCR suppressed
          exponential population growth in cell culture (Figure
          1A). Using flow cytometry to measure membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content of cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> stimulation
          resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold increase (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32.6%</NUMEX>) in the
          proportion of apoptotic cells after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hrs</TIMEX> (Figure
          1B).
          BCR-mediated tyrosine kinase activation is thought to
          be involved in the signal transduction cascades that give
          rise to these changes in cell growth and viability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          . To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> engagement under these conditions
          leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activation, increasing amounts of
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">IgM</ENAMEX> were added to cultured BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells. An 
          in vitro Syk specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX>-complex kinase assay was used to measure changes
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX> activity in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> stimulation (Figure
          2A). In unstimulated and control treated BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 6</TIMEX>), low,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> levels of Syk activity were detected. The
          autophosphorylation activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> increased
          dramatically with the addition of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM; Syk</ENAMEX> activity
          responded in a dose dependent manner and reached a
          plateau at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 μg</TIMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) in which activity was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~15</NUMEX> fold
          higher than in unstimulated cells.
          The kinetics of BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> activation was
          analyzed to determine the rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activation
          and inactivation following initial engagement of the BCR
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maximal Syk</ENAMEX> activation occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> engagement (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and decreased to
          intermediate levels at times thereafter (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 5</TIMEX>).
          Additional experiments revealed that even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> after
          BCR stimulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activity remained slightly elevated
          in comparison with unstimulated cells (data not
          shown).
          The increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX> activity in response to BCR
          engagement in BCL 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 .3B3</ENAMEX> was accompanied by an increase
          in tyrosine phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Syk protein</ENAMEX> in cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). No phosphorylated tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were
          detected on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in unstimulated or control treated cells
          (lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk
          peaked after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> stimulation (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and
          decreased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The rapid induction of
          tyrosine phosphorylation and its subsequent reduction
          paralleled the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity (Figure
          2B).
        
        
          Expression of a (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> results in a
          dominant positive effect
          BCR-mediated apoptosis was preceded by an increase in
          Syk kinase activity in BCL 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 .3B3.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> has also been implicated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> B lymphoma
          line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DT40</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . To determine the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in the apoptotic response in BCL 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 .3B3</ENAMEX>, overexpression of a mutant
          form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> was used in an effort to alter the level of
          Syk activation following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> engagement. Site-specific
          mutations were placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>. A lysine at
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid position 395</ENAMEX>, predicted to be critical for
          kinase activity, was replaced by an alanine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> carboxy-terminal tyrosines (positions <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">624-6</ENAMEX>),
          hypothesized to play regulatory roles, were replaced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanines</ENAMEX>. Based on the effects of similar mutations
          in other kinases it was expected that the combination of
          these replacements in (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> might produce a
          dominant negative effect.
          BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells were infected with
          defective retroviruses expressing wildtype or (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant Syk</ENAMEX>. Clones expressing varying levels of wildtype
          or mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> mRNA were identified using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-primer
          reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Using this approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          differing in size were simultaneously amplified from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and the endogenous syk cDNAs in the same PCR
          reaction. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk expression varied relative to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endogenous Syk</ENAMEX> and ranged from undetectable levels
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-10</TIMEX>) to equivalent expression levels
          (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The highest transgene expression was found in
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.2</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX> was used to determine the effect of
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk expression on endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>. Syk activity
          was measured in parental BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> .3B3 (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3D</TIMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3</ENAMEX>) and
          cells that express the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 4 -</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). Surprisingly, cells that expressed the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          molecule displayed constitutive Syk activity in
          unstimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,7</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). A correlation
          between constitutive kinase activity and mRNA expression
          levels of (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> was observed (compare Figure
          3Cwith Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>); clones with higher levels of
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mRNA (e.g. clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.2</NUMEX>) had higher levels
          of constitutive kinase activity, while clones with lower
          levels of (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) Syk mRNA (e.g. clones <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4.2</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.7</NUMEX>) had lower levels of constitutive kinase
          activity. Thus, it appeared that introduction of this
          mutant form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> resulted in a dominant positive effect
          on kinase activity rather than a dominant negative
          effect.
          To determine if the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> activity is an
          artefact of the 
          in vitro assay, a series of immune
          complex kinase assays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> precipitated from mixtures
          of lysates was performed. Most significantly, a mixture
          of a lysate from unstimulated BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells harbouring wildtype Syk
          with a lysate from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">unstimulated DT40</TIMEX> expressing the
          K395A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3F mutant Syk</ENAMEX> (see below), at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:5, 1:1 and 5:1</TIMEX>
          ratios, showed no activity in the immune complex kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These data indicate that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> must be expressed together with the
          wildtype enzyme in cells to generate the dominant
          positive phenotype, and suggest that it's effect is
          indirect. Although we cannot rule out the possibility
          that the kinase activation is occurring during the
          isolation procedure, the results of the mixing experiment
          suggest that the wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> enzyme is active 
          in vivo under these conditions.
          To determine if expression of the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mutant
          resulted in a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> responsiveness, the kinetics
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activation were measured in clones <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.6</NUMEX>
          following BCR stimulation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3E</NUMEX>). Incubation with
          anti-IgM induced a rapid increase and delayed reduction
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX> activity with kinetics similar to that of control
          clones. Although the basal levels of Syk activity were
          elevated in clones that expressed the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX>, the cells were still responsive to BCR
          signaling.
          To determine if the constitutive Syk activity observed
          in unstimulated cells carrying the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
          was accompanied by constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> tyrosine
          phosphorylation, the levels of phosphotyrosine on Syk
          were determined by immunoblotting after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3F</NUMEX>). Syk from unstimulated
          BCL 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 .3B3</ENAMEX> and vector control clones had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phospho-tyrosine</ENAMEX> (lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3,4</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Syk from unstimulated clones carrying
          the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, which had constitutive Syk
          activity, also had undetectable levels of tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 9, 10 and 12</TIMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          Thus, despite constitutive Syk activity observed in these
          infectants, tyrosine phosphorylation did not correlate
          with activity (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 and 10</TIMEX> of Figure 3Dwith
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lanes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 7</NUMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3F</NUMEX>). Syk from all clones
          analyzed became tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 5, 8 and 11</TIMEX>). It was possible that
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in the immunoprecipitate was required for
          detection by the anti-phosphotyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. However,
          even when more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was present in the
          immunoprecipitate, little if any phosphotyrosine was
          detected in unstimulated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 and 15</TIMEX>). These

          results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activation does not require
          tyrosine phosphorylation.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> were considered to explain the high
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> autophosphorylation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstimulated</ENAMEX> clones expressing the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX>, the possibility existed that the intense band
          observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Dlanes 4, 7</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) was
          not due to increased Syk activity, but rather to the
          ability of the background levels of active endogenous Syk
          to preferentially phosphorylate the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          molecule due to possible changes in its three-dimensional
          structure. If the kinase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> was truly higher
          in cells expressing (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX>, enhanced
          phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate would also be
          observed. To examine the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> from cells that
          expressed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk to phosphorylate an exogenous Syk
          target, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c3b-GST</ENAMEX> was added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk ICKA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
          lower panels). The exogenous substrate was phosphorylated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> from unstimulated clones expressing the
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>),
          demonstrating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> isolated from these
          cells was highly active.
          Although activated endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> was the likely
          source of the constitutive Syk activity observed in
          clones that expressed the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule, the
          possibility remained that the activity might originate
          from the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule itself. As proof that the
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule was inactive as predicted,
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> and wildtype Syk expression constructs were
          transfected into 
          syk -negative DT40 cells, and
          activity measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). While wildtype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human Syk</ENAMEX> was capable of autophosphorylation (lane 2
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mutant was not (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) demonstrating that this molecule was kinase-dead.
          This result indicates that the constitutive Syk activity
          identified in BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> .3B3 clones expressing (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          was likely due to endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> and not the
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mutant.
          Expression of the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule resulted in
          constitutive activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>. However, overexpression
          of a full-length unmutated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> might also generate the
          same phenotype. To determine if the constitutive
          phenotype was a result of the specific mutations
          introduced or if overexpression of a full-length Syk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX> was sufficient to give high basal kinase
          activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activity was analyzed from BCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells that expressed a wildtype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The levels of wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human Syk</ENAMEX> expression were determined using the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-primer RT-PCR assay described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>).
          Shown are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> clones that expressed low levels
          or equivalent levels of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Syk mRNA</ENAMEX> as compared with
          the levels of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>, upper
          panel). The levels of Syk activity in unstimulated cells
          expressing wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> were indistinguishable from the
          levels in unstimulated controls (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>, compare lanes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). None of the clones analyzed contained
          elevated constitutive Syk activity in unstimulated cells,
          demonstrating that this phenotype requires the presence
          of the unique mutations introduced.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constitutive Syk</ENAMEX> activity is insufficient for
          downstream signaling
          In 
          syk -deficient DT40 cells, BCR
          induced apoptosis was abrogated indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> was 
          necessary for this cellular
          response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Having established cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constitutive Syk</ENAMEX> activity, it was now possible to
          establish if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activation is 
          sufficient for any of the signaling
          responses. However, no impact on cell growth in culture
          was found in clones with high constitutive Syk activity,
          nor was the growth suppressive effect of anti-IgM
          treatment enhanced (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7A</NUMEX>). Likewise, no significant
          difference in apoptosis was observed between clones with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constitutive Syk</ENAMEX> activity and controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>).
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity alone was insufficient to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> a cellular response in BCL 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 .3B3.</ENAMEX> However, the presence of Syk
          kinase activity was still expected to lead to increased
          phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets in the absence of
          stimulation through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>. To examine this possibility,
          the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphotyrosine</ENAMEX> were evaluated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblotting</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7C</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal</ENAMEX> levels of
          phosphotyrosine-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were detected in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> analyzed (lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,7</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). However, no
          increase was observed in cells with constitutive Syk
          activity. After stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>, many intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> became highly phosphorylated on tyrosine to
          equivalent levels in all clones, regardless of the level
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 5, 8 and 11</TIMEX>). These data
          indicate that despite elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basal</ENAMEX> and induced Syk
          kinase activity in clones carrying the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, global phosphorylation of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was
          not increased.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-phosphotyrosine</ENAMEX> immunoblot used is a
          relatively crude measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity 
          in vivo . The possibility remained
          that any specific effects of constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> on its
          downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> might be masked by the combined
          effects of the other tyrosine kinases activated in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> signaling. To focus the investigation on
          downstream events of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activation, the phosphorylation
          state of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>, an authentic, direct downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] , was evaluated. No <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX> phosphorylation was
          detected in unstimulated clones containing constitutive
          Syk activity (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7D</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 7</TIMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> was rapidly and highly phosphorylated
          after stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 8</TIMEX>). As in the total
          cellular phosphotyrosine analysis, the levels of
          phosphotyrosine on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> were indistinguishable between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and experimental cell lines.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous studies have identified apoptosis and cell
        cycle arrest as mechanisms of BCR-induced growth arrest in
        BCL 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The studies
        presented here have demonstrated that stimulation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> resulted in the rapid and transient activation of the
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor tyrosine kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX>. Previous studies have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implicated Syk</ENAMEX> in BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in other cell lines
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . To examine the putative role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in
        BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and cell cycle arrest in BCL 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 .3B3</ENAMEX>, we attempted to alter Syk
        activity through the expression of mutant forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>.
        When the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mutant was co-expressed with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous Syk</ENAMEX> in BCL 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 .3B3</NUMEX> cells, a constitutive Syk
        activation phenotype was observed. The presence of elevated
        Syk activity allowed us to evaluate the role of Syk
        activation on the growth and viability of BCL 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 .3B3</ENAMEX>, and on other biochemical changes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> signaling. To our surprise, no evidence
        for downstream signaling was found in cells with high
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> novel observations were obtained from these studies.
        First, expression of the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule in BCL 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.3B3</TIMEX> results in constitutive
        activation of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>. Since (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> was
        enzymatically inactive when transfected into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX>-deficient
        DT40 cells, the observed constitutive kinase activity must
        be derived from endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> and not from the
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Mutant molecules that inhibit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> or function of the wildtype counterpart in the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> have been defined as dominant-negative molecules.
        Since (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> has an activating effect on endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wildtype Syk</ENAMEX>, we propose that (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> is a
        dominant-positive molecule.
        It is likely that the replacement of the three
        carboxy-terminal tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with phenylalanine is
        necessary for the dominant-positive phenotype. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitlmann et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> found that transfection of a mutant Syk expression
        construct carrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only the 3F</TIMEX> alteration into a T cell
        lines could overcome the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> occupancy for IL-2
        expression in PMA-treated cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . However, since the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant Syk</ENAMEX> used retained kinase activity, these studies
        could not distinguish between a gain-of-function effect
        versus a dominant-positive effect as found here.
        The mechanism by which the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activates endogenous Syk</ENAMEX> is unknown. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hypothesis is that
        a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> is bound and sequestered by the
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk molecule. By sequestering this negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, expression of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Syk</ENAMEX> molecules gives
        rise to the activation of the endogenous wildtype protein
        in the absence of specific stimulation, leading to a
        constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> phenotype. Several negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> have been reported. BCR-induced
        interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cbl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> increases the
        susceptibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> to proteolysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , possibly
        through enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ubiquitination</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Expression
        of a dominant-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SHP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphatase</ENAMEX> in the mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine</ENAMEX> B cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K46</NUMEX> resulted in an increase in
        BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase activity as measured by C3b
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX> and enhanced BCR-induced Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluxes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . It remains to be determined if
        interference with any of these known regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
        responsible for the dominant-positive effect.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel observation, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase enzymatic
        activity was insufficient for signal transduction, suggests
        that multiple biochemical processes may be required for the
        Syk-dependent step of signal transduction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presently</ENAMEX>, it is
        unclear what biochemical changes, other than enzymatic
        activation, are required. However, in light of the present
        model of signaling through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>, perhaps appropriate
        subcellular localization to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> complex and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITAMs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD79b</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igβ</ENAMEX>) is also required. In support of this
        hypothesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syk</ENAMEX> did not co-precipitate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> in
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk-containing cells, without stimulation (data
        not shown). This is not surprising since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITAMs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD79</TIMEX>,
        which are proposed to be docking sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>, are
        unlikely to be phosphorylated in the absence of BCR
        stimulation since phosphorylation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> likely
        requires activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Src</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinases
        expressed in B cells. Therefore, despite constitutive Syk
        kinase activity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITAMs</ENAMEX> in the
        dominant-positive-expressing cells remain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophosphorylated</ENAMEX> because kinases that are upstream of Syk
        and/or are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">independent</ENAMEX> are not active in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> crosslinking.
        This result implies that in addition to enzymatic
        activation, localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> might be
        required for functional signal transduction. There is
        precedence for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Mutation of tyrosine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> in Syk
        to glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effects. First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y130E</TIMEX> mutation
        resulted in constitutive activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, molecules
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y130E</NUMEX> mutations did not co-immunoprecipitate with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> example involves an 
        in vitro model of histamine release
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syk-deficient RBL-2H3</ENAMEX> cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . When
        tyrosines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">519 and 520</NUMEX> were mutated and introduced into
        Syk-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RBL-2H3</ENAMEX> cells, these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Syk</ENAMEX> molecules were
        capable of phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c3b</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICKA</ENAMEX>.
        However, despite this activity, there was no high affinity
        IgE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FcεRI</ENAMEX>)-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">degranulation</ENAMEX>. Further
        analysis demonstrated neither increases in phosphotyrosine
        nor phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>.
        Alternatively, the absence of signal transduction in the
        presence of Syk activity may be related to its ability to
        interact with its downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> there are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, allowing for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. In addition, phosphotyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syk</ENAMEX> would provide additional sites for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. Perhaps, further modification
        is necessary to increase its affinity for downstream
        binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLNK</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>.
        The absence of signaling in the presence of constitutive
        enzymatic activity described for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in different systems
        implies that execution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>-dependent step in this
        signaling cascade is a multi-step process. Multiple
        requirements for progression through this step in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathway may serve to integrate the
        cellular response to multiple environmental cues. In this
        case, the ultimate cellular response to the activation of
        the BCR signaling pathway is cell death. Each of these
        required steps may provide a regulatory site where other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways could intersect the default
        response to antigenic stimulation giving rise to an altered
        cellular outcome.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, here we describe the use of a mutant Syk
        construct to produce a dominant-positive effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endogenous Syk</ENAMEX> activation in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> engagement.
        The presence of a dominant-positive effect under these
        conditions suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> kinase is kept inactive in
        resting cells by an active suppression mechanisms, which is
        disrupted by the presence of the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K395A/3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)Syk mutant. The
        specific target for this dominant-positive effect remains
        to be identified. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> enzyme is active under
        these conditions, it lacks any detectable phosphorylation
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tyrosine residues</ENAMEX>. This observation indicates that the
        current paradigm that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activation results from tyrosine
        phosphorylation may be incorrect. Finally, the presence of
        a highly active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> enzyme in cells was insufficient for
        downstream signal transduction as evidenced by a lack of
        change in global tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation
        of PLC<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-γ2</NUMEX> or enhanced spontaneous or induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
        These data suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX>-dependent step in signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> requires biochemical changes in addition to
        enzymatic activation, perhaps proper localization of the
        active enzyme to a signaling receptor complex.
