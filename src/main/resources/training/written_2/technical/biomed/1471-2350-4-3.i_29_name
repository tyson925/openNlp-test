        Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoglobulin G</ENAMEX> subclass <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX>) are
        characterized by subnormal serum concentrations of total
        IgG, or by normal serum total IgG concentrations with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">IgG</ENAMEX> subclasses, respectively; in
        some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> levels are also subnormal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ]
        . Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> are diagnosed to have CVID or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgGSD</ENAMEX> because
        they have increased frequency and severity of infections
        due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and other microbial pathogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Although a susceptibility locus for these disorders has not
        been identified, they often appear to be familial and to
        segregate with markers on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ch6p</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        The purpose of the present work was to quantify and
        analyze the frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B phenotypes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in index cases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> who presented because they had increased frequency
        or severity of infections, and to compare the present
        results to those of control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in this geographic
        area. We also evaluated the relationships of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B
        phenotype frequencies and haplotypes with phenotypes
        defined by serum immunoglobulin concentrations, and we
        estimated the combined frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central Alabama</ENAMEX> based upon the occurrence of these
        disorders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> of the present index cases. The
        implications of the present results in determining the
        hereditary basis and immunoglobulin phenotype expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> are discussed.

            Subjects promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Medical Association</ENAMEX>
            Declaration of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Helsinki</ENAMEX> were followed. All subjects
            were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (â‰¥ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years of age</TIMEX>) who identified
            themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX>; each resided in central
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
            diagnosed to have CVID or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> were designated as
            index cases. All index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were diagnosed in
            routine medical care in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> medical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>; none was diagnosed as a consequence of family
            or population screening. We included all evaluable
            index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between November 1991 and June</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and IgGSD Index Cases
            Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> because he/she had frequent or
            unusually severe infections. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a single,
            severe or life-threatening infection that required
            hospitalization or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more infections per year
            that required antibiotic therapy for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive years</TIMEX>. None was known to have pre-existing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">isolated IgA deficiency</ENAMEX> or other abnormality of
            immunity. Diagnoses were based on demonstration of
            persistent, otherwise unexplained serum concentrations
            of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">immunoglobulins > 2 S.D.</NUMEX> below the corresponding
            mean levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Criteria for the diagnosis of CVID
            were: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) decreased total serum IgG concentration; and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) either decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> subclass(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX>), decreased serum
            IgA concentration, or decreased serum IgM concentration
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Criteria for the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> were: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            normal total serum IgG concentration; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) abnormally
            low serum concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">IgG</ENAMEX> subclasses;
            some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> also had decreased levels of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
            We excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> descent
            because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) certain HLA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and haplotypes differ
            significantly among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central Alabama</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, serum
            concentrations of immunoglobulins are often greater in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> descent than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of sub-Saharan descent occur
            infrequently in series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
            , and such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are uncommon in our experience. We
            also excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who had isolated deficiencies of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgM</ENAMEX>, those with hypogammaglobulinemia
            attributable to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B-cell neoplasms</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g .</ENAMEX>, B-chronic lymphocytic

            non-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hodgkin's lymphoma</ENAMEX>) or those with markedly
            increased immunoglobulin loss ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g .</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nephrotic syndrome</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-losing enteropathy).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Subjects</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,321</NUMEX> apparently normal, unrelated
            Caucasian adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> who had undergone
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B phenotype analysis as part of paternity
            testing were used to estimate allele and gene
            frequencies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B haplotypes were
            determined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">751</NUMEX> unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> who had undergone testing to establish
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paternity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Haplotypes were assessed from a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and his/her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, and included in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set. Preliminary data analysis revealed that
            frequencies of the major HLA-A and -B haplotypes
            observed in the present control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were similar
            to those estimated to occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasians</ENAMEX> from a large
            national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor program</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
            We diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IgGSD deficiency</ENAMEX> in some family
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> using the same criteria defined herein for
            index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> presented themselves for
            evaluation after an index case was diagnosed in their
            respective kinships because they also had increased
            frequency and severity of bacterial infections.
            Although other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of index cases were also
            reported to have increased frequency and severity of
            infections or to have some form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody deficiency</ENAMEX>,
            they were not included in the present study because we
            did not evaluate them. Screening or other systematic
            testing of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the present index cases
            was beyond the scope of the present study.
          
        
        
          Laboratory Methods
          Serum concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG, IgA, IgM</ENAMEX>, and IgG
          subclasses were measured using standard automated methods
          before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> replacement therapy was initiated. Reference
          ranges for serum immunoglobulin concentrations are: total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IgG 700 - 1600 mg/dL</ENAMEX>; IgG 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 422 - 1292 mg/dL</ENAMEX>; IgG 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 117 - 747 mg/dL</ENAMEX>; IgG 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 41 - 129</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL; IgG 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 1 - 291 mg/dL</ENAMEX>; total IgA 70 - 400
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dL</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 - 230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL. The basis of these
          reference ranges has been reported elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Deficiency</ENAMEX> of an immunoglobulin class or subclass was
          defined by a serum concentration at diagnosis that was
          less than the corresponding lower reference limit.
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> subclasses, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgD</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> in serum was
          not routinely performed.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> -A and -B alleles were detected using
          low-resolution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based typing (PCR/sequence-specific
          oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) in index cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were tested using the microdroplet
          lymphocytotoxicity test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were evaluated
          using antisera that detected allele assignments described
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">thInternational</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Histocompatibility Workshop</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          ] . Because the levels of resolution of the DNA-based and
          serological typing methods we used are similar, alleles
          detected by these respective methods provide concordant
          allele assignments, with the exception of B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>
          that were not detected by serological methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> typing
          of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> was performed to permit assignment of
          Ch6p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotypes</ENAMEX>. In each index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in whom a single A
          or B allele was detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based typing, we verified
          the allele(s) and set phase to ascertain haplotypes of
          the index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> analyses of appropriate
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. For the present analysis, all haplotypes
          were defined only by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and B alleles.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Considerations</ENAMEX>
          A data set that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B phenotypes in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A
          and -B haplotypes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
          available. Absolute or "uncorrected" values of A and B
          phenotype frequencies in index cases, A and B haplotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>, and occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haplotype</ENAMEX> combinations
          were calculated after enumeration of the raw data. To
          correct for the possible occurrence of spurious HLA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> and haplotype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> due to multiple
          comparisons, we also computed values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> inequality
          method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . "Corrected" values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> are displayed in tabular form
          along with "uncorrected" values. A computer spreadsheet
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel 2000</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>) and a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsystems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Spring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) were used to
          perform the present analyses. Means were compared using a

          using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tail), as appropriate. A value of

            B15, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>) and recurrent upper and lower respiratory
            tract infections. Her twin had normal serum
            concentrations of total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG, IgG</ENAMEX> subclasses, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgA</ENAMEX>, and
            IgM, and did not report increased frequency or severity
            of infections.
          
        
        
          Estimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population Frequency</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and
          IgGSD
          The occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> of the
          present index cases permitted us to estimate the combined
          population frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. At the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of diagnosis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> of the present 240 index cases had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>, we diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CVID</ENAMEX> in one
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in another because they also had increased
          frequency and severity of bacterial infections,
          predominantly those of the upper and lower respiratory
          tracts. Thus, a conservative estimate of the combined
          frequencies of these disorders in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in central
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0092</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/217</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present observations demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and IgGSD
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> diagnosed in routine medical care
        delivery are significantly associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch6p</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than two-thirds</NUMEX> of the present 195 index
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were evaluable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotyping</ENAMEX> inherited one
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the significantly associated haplotypes
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>, and
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>. This indicates that a susceptibility locus
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">loci</NUMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> occurs on multiple haplotypes
        defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B typing. Further, this implies that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch6p</ENAMEX> alleles associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or IgGSD
        susceptibility occur on many HLA haplotypes that are common
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasians</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and in Caucasians
        from a large national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor program</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The present observations also confirm and extend the
        reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotype A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08</TIMEX> (or an
        extended haplotype containing A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">01</TIMEX> and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08</TIMEX>) with heritable
        forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunoglobulin deficiency</ENAMEX> demonstrated in
        family-based analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . It is likely
        that a candidate gene(s) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or IgGSD exists in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II region, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 19 20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class II</ENAMEX> region is closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-B</ENAMEX> locus than to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A locus, it is plausible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene(s) for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II region are in greater linkage
        disequilibrium with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-B</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-A.</ENAMEX> This is consistent
        with the aggregate observations on HLA-A and -B typing in
        the present study.
        The present observations demonstrate that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies of HLA-A</ENAMEX> and -B phenotypes and haplotypes were
        not significantly different in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> index
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with few exceptions. These observations could be
        explained by the occurrence of an HLA-linked allele that is
        necessary to cause either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgGSD</ENAMEX>, but is
        insufficient to induce a specific immunoglobulin deficiency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, the variable immunoglobulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency phenotypes</ENAMEX> presently classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and
        IgGSD are best explained by the co-inheritance of multiple
        alleles, each of which has an independent effect on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype</ENAMEX>. Regardless, the
        variability we observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> phenotypes in
        index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is best explained by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-inheritance of multiple allele(s) that influence the
        immunoglobulin phenotype. This is consistent with evidence
        for the occurrence on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch6p</TIMEX> of multiple distinct
        susceptibility <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for patterns of immunoglobulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, some recessive and others dominant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . For
        example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> putative alleles associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heritable IgA</ENAMEX> deficiency occur on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch6p</TIMEX>, and each is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a different major histocompatibility (MHC)
        region haplotype [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] , whereas a putative
        susceptibility locus on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> is not a major
        contributor to selective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IgA deficiency</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allele</ENAMEX>(s)
        on chromosomes other than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch6p</TIMEX> may also influence the
        phenotypic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The
        inheritance of certain polymorphisms of the mannose-binding
        lectin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch10</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> are associated
        with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> age of onset of manifestations of antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> and with increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoimmunity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Altogether, these observations are consistent with the
        hypothesis that many common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heritable antibody</ENAMEX> deficiency
        phenotypes collectively diagnosed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> are the
        result of the inheritance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple disease</ENAMEX>-predisposing
        alleles on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch6p</TIMEX> and possibly other chromosomes.
        We have estimated that the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and IgGSD
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0092</NUMEX>. This estimated
        prevalence could be reasonably attributed to the fact that
        many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes significantly associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> are also common in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        This could also explain a) the inheritance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        significantly associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes in many of the
        present index cases, including most of the index patients
        who were HLA-haploidentical with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other index
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>; b) the disparate immunoglobulin deficiency
        phenotypes of multiple family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who inherited the
        same HLA haplotype; and c) the occurrence of disparate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> who had similar immunoglobulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
        Some of the haplotypes significantly associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in the present study also occur with
        significantly increased frequencies in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>
        Caucasian hemochromatosis probands with homozygosity for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ch6p</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These
        haplotypes are A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ; present
        study]. These observations imply that susceptibility
        alleles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> occur on haplotypes that
        sometimes include the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>. In addition, the
        haplotypes A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08</TIMEX> and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> significantly associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in the present study are common in both
        hemochromatosis probands homozygous for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ; present study]. Taken together, these
        observations could explain the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> or IgGSD
        and hemochromatosis due to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX> in some of the
        present index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and account for the
        occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IgA deficiency</ENAMEX> and hemochromatosis in
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> are significantly associated with the HLA
        haplotypes A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>, and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>. Many of these haplotypes are also
        common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Immunoglobulin
        phenotype variability demonstrated in index cases and in
        family studies suggest that there are multiple gene(s) on
        Ch6p or other chromosomes that modify the immunoglobulin
        phenotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX>. The estimated prevalence of
        these disorders in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0092</NUMEX>. The estimated
        prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgGSD</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> could be
        reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes
        significantly associated with these disorders are also
        common in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
