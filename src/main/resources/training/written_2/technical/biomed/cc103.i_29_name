        The term acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> (ARF) has been used to
        encompass a wide variety of clinical disorders ranging from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glomerulonephritis</ENAMEX> to prerenal azotemia. It is generally
        defined as a rapid decline (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>) in
        glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and retention of
        nitrogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste products</ENAMEX>. Each underlying disorder has
        its own unique pathophysiology and separate set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etiologies</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, many of these clinical syndromes
        have specific treatments. Accordingly, it is not possible
        to consider the issue of whether diuretics or dopamine are
        useful in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> without first considering the differences
        between these individual disorders. Moreover, data drawn
        from animal experiments, where compounds such as uranyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitrate</ENAMEX> or glycerol were used to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARF</ENAMEX>, must be
        interpreted with caution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Still, much of our
        understanding of these disorders, and the effects of
        various treatments, comes from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. In general,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diuretics</ENAMEX> and/or dopamine are usually considered for the
        prevention or treatment of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
        The basic rationale is that ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> should be improved
        by increasing renal blood flow and that tubular obstruction
        should be decreased by maintaining urine flow.
        The use of diuretics to prevent or even 'treat' renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> has become a widely accepted clinical practice.
        Indeed, management protocols for some routine patients
        often include orders for furosemide when urine output falls
        below some cutoff value. Some protocols even utilize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">socalled 'renal</ENAMEX>-dose' dopamine in these circumstances. It
        is therefore necessary to review the evidence in support of
        such practices. Given the broad range of conditions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposing</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> and the multiple comorbidities of
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a systematic review addressing the
        effect of different treatments must be interpreted in light
        of these clinical features. Therefore, the purpose of this
        review was to evaluate the impact of diuretics and dopamine
        for both the prevention and treatment of renal dysfunction
        in the acute care setting.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Search strategy
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> search was conducted using databases from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966 to May 1997</TIMEX>. Articles dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX> (drug
          effects) and diuretics or dopamine were searched. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of articles was then limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
          clinical trials or meta-analyses of human studies.
          Bibliographies of review articles on these topics were
          also searched by hand for additional studies meeting the
          above criteria. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of articles was then screened
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> for studies addressing the use of diuretics
          or dopamine in the prevention and/or treatment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Inclusion and exclusion criteria
          For the purpose of this review only loop diuretics,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mannitol</ENAMEX> and dopamine were included. Loop diuretics
          included the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> furosemide, bumetanide and torsemide.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have become the most widely used for the
          indications considered in this review. Although
          ethacrynic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is also a loop diuretic, it was excluded
          because it is not commonly used in clinical practice.
          Additionally, other diuretic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as thiazides
          were excluded. Similarly, this review will not discuss
          any of the yet experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX> such as atrial
          natriuretic factor. The primary analysis included only
          studies that involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and were published in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Critical appraisal methods
          Individual studies were graded by levels according to
          the criteria in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, adapted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cook</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. When multiple studies
          were available, the highest level study was used.
          Clinical trials of the effectiveness of diuretics or
          dopamine were judged to be effective only if the outcome
          measures were of clinical significance (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eg</ENAMEX> mortality,
          need for hemodialysis) or in terms of biochemical
          evidence of organ function (serum creatinine or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">creatinine</ENAMEX> clearance) following the maneuver. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Surrogate</ENAMEX>
          markers such as urine output or renal blood flow were not
          considered as evidence of effectiveness. Furthermore,
          trials of dopamine were not considered controlled unless
          confounding variables such as blood pressure and cardiac
          output were reported. Similarly, for both diuretics and
          dopamine, the volume status of the control and treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> must have been similar.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiocontrastinduced</ENAMEX> ATN
          Radiocontrast-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> is rare in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
          underlying renal, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> or hepatic dysfunction and
          occurs most commonly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. In this group the incidence approaches
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, depending on the degree of baseline renal function
          and the use of ionic 
          vs nonionic contrast media [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
          Several forms of therapy have been proposed to prevent or
          treat radiocontrast-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>, including saline,
          furosemide, mannitol, calcium channel blockers, dopamine,
          atrial natriuretic peptide and theophylline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. There
          are no placebo controlled trials testing the
          effectiveness of any of these therapies. Virtually all
          studies have used hydration (usually with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.45%</NUMEX> saline)
          in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> being tested and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          recommend its use. However, even then, little comparative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> exist for these potential treatments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> exception
          is the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] which compared the
          effects of furosemide plus saline, mannitol plus saline
          and saline alone; again, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.45%</NUMEX> saline was used. This
          randomized trial of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> `high-risk' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> found that
          both diuretic regimens were less effective in preventing
          ATN than saline alone (relative risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> using
          mannitol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> or furosemide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> 
          vs saline alone; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). Another study, by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Weinstein</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> , found that renal function
          significantly deteriorated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> pretreated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furosemide</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, to date <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> clinical trials
          have been published using dopamine to prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiocontrastinduced ATN</ENAMEX>. Hall 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] studied the effects of
          dopamine infusion on serum creatinine assessed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          after radiocontrast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          baseline serum creatinine levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2.0</NUMEX> mg/dl. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level III</ENAMEX> study did show an improvement in serum
          creatinine with dopamine compared to a control group
          which received mannitol. However, given the evidence that
          mannitol may actually be harmful in this setting [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>],
          this was probably not the appropriate control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In
          the only other controlled trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] found no difference in
          the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> with or without dopamine (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX>) in
          a small series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>). Thus, for this indication
          we can safely conclude that diuretics and dopamine are
          clearly not helpful and may even be harmful, while volume
          expansion with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.45%</NUMEX> saline is unproven but potentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Prevention of ischemic ATN
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> trial
          used loop diuretics. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hager</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] randomized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          to receive either furosemide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/h</ENAMEX>) or placebo starting
          immediately after major thoraco-abdominal or vascular
          surgery and continuing throughout the intensive care unit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>) stay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> measured creatinine clearance and
          found no difference between furosemide and placebo.
          Unfortunately, the study was unable to address the use of
          loop diuretics given during the procedure.
          The facts are even less clear regarding mannitol in
          vascular surgery. The only controlled study available is
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beall</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. This study
          compared the outcomes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who underwent
          elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to receive either no pre-operative fluid, iv
          hydration only or iv hydration plus mannitol as required
          to keep urine output > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min. There was no change
          in renal function or postoperative urine output between
          the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Although this negative study was
          certainly underpowered, it remains the only controlled
          trial of mannitol in vascular surgery to date. The
          following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> reported the outcomes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with mannitol [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. This uncontrolled
          study reported that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had an increase in urine
          output and none developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATN</ENAMEX>. No recent studies have
          been carried out to address this issue and it is unlikely
          that any will. In other types of surgery, such as
          coronary artery bypass [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] or biliary surgery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>],
          small studies have also been unable to demonstrate a
          benefit associated with mannitol. Given these
          considerations, and in the absence of clinical data,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diuretics</ENAMEX> cannot be recommended to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>.
          Thirty clinical studies of dopamine have been
          published to date, both for prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> and
          treatment of early ATN (including radiocontrast-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> of these used outcomes other than
          surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">markers</ENAMEX> (eg urine output, renal blood flow),
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> were positive. These included the study by
          Hall 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], cited above, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          others which were both methodologically inferior, one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level IV</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> level <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Polson</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] found a significant
          difference in creatinine clearance and a decrease in ARF
          in liver transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 μg/kg/min</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX>. The findings of this level <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> study were not
          supported by a level <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study from Swygert 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], also in liver
          transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swygert</ENAMEX> study used <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 μg/kg/min</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> and found no difference compared to placebo in
          terms of creatinine clearance or incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>). The results of a small level V study by
          Palmieri 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] appear to suggest that
          dopamine may be useful in shortening the recovery time
          from interleukin-2-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX>. Apart from these two
          studies, the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42</TIMEX>], collectively enrolling over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, are all negative. Among these is a recent level
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study by Lherm 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] in which dopamine
          infusion failed to improve renal function in patients
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> except for transiently increasing creatinine
          clearance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without shock.
        
        
          Treatment of established ATN
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials evaluating the use of diuretics in
          the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fulfilled outcome criteria.
          Both studies evaluated the effects of treatment on
          mortality and the need for dialysis. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
          Kleinknecht 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] randomized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          to receive furosemide or placebo. Although, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furosemide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did experience improved urine output,
          there were no significant differences between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in terms of renal recovery, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> on dialysis or
          mortality. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] had similar results. In
          this study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were given a single dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furosemide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 g</ENAMEX>) and then randomized either to receive or
          not receive continued diuretic therapy; again, there were
          no differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in terms of need
          for dialysis or survival. Unfortunately, even the two
          studies together lack sufficient power to entirely rule
          out the possibility that diuretics have a beneficial
          effect on survival. Nonetheless, the available literature
          to date does not support a survival benefit for this
          therapy.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diuretics</ENAMEX> and ATN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimentally</ENAMEX>, the effectiveness of diuretics in the
          prevention of ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> appears to be related to
          timing. While no data exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, several lines of
          evidence from animal experiments suggest that
          interventions such as diuretics may be useful if given
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> (or perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few hours</TIMEX>) following
          a renal insult [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Once this time limit has passed, the
          intervention will be ineffective. This is because the
          unifying principle is cytoprotection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> tubular
          cells which, if lethally injured, may only be `rescued'
          for a short time. The injury to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> tubular cells
          has been attributed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major factors: renal
          vasoconstriction, reduction of glomerular capillary
          permeability, tubular obstruction and transepithelial
          back-leak of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filtrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. In theory, loop diuretics
          may be useful in combating each of these factors. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> decrease the metabolic demand of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> tubular
          cell, reducing its oxygen requirement and hence
          increasing its resistance to ischemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] and perhaps
          to other toxic insults as well. A greater urine flow may
          also reduce the incidence of tubular obstruction and the
          higher hydraulic pressures may reduce the back-leak of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filtrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. In the latter case, fluid resuscitation
          alone may produce much of the same effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          In practical terms these data from animal studies
          offer little to guide practice in the care of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          though they provide great insight into the various
          mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>. This is because it is not usually
          possible to anticipate the renal injury and act within
          the time required to have an effect. However, there are
          notable exceptions, such as aortic cross-clamping in
          aneurysm repair. The use of loop diuretics has become
          routine for this indication in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
          Nonetheless there appears to be no evidence in support of
          this approach.
          Additionally, there are some situations in which the
          renal injury is subacute or mild and sustained. Such is
          often the case in conditions such as rhabdomyolysis,
          drug-induced renal injury, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatorenal syndrome</ENAMEX>, and ARF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cardiopulmonary bypass circulation in
          cardiac surgery (especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          pre-operative renal impairment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]). In these
          conditions it is often possible to act in an attempt to
          prevent or reduce the renal injury as it evolves.
          Although the specifics of renal injury vary somewhat
          between these forms of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subacute</ENAMEX>' renal failure, all are
          exacerbated by hypovolemia and, therefore, any
          consideration of the use of loop diuretics must include a
          provision for adequate volume replacement. This
          requirement makes it difficult to separate the effects of
          diuretics from the effects of the increased fluid given
          to prevent diuretic-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypovolemia</ENAMEX>. Dramatic
          evidence exists from a case-controlled study to support
          the use of (`early and aggressive') hydration along with
          forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alkaline</ENAMEX>/osmotic diuresis (mannitol) for the
          treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> secondary to traumatic rhabdomyolysis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. In this study, delayed treatment in a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX>,
          while in another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> prompt treatment was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          successful in avoiding this complication even though
          renal injury had already begun. Unlike loop diuretics,
          mannitol functions as an intravascular volume expander,
          at least initially, and may also function as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">free-radical</ENAMEX> scavenger. None of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
          loop diuretics and, indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have argued that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydration</ENAMEX> alone may have been sufficient to produce many
          of salutary effects of the osmotic diuresis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          Once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> is established there are no therapies that
          have been proven to reverse it. The most a clinician can
          do is to manage the complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> and limit
          further renal insult so as to assure the best chance of
          renal recovery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diuretics</ENAMEX> can be both useful and harmful
          in this regard. The harm comes from reducing the
          circulating volume too much and adding a prerenal insult
          on top of the established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>. The recovering kidney may
          be even more susceptible to this `<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hit' and may be
          profoundly injured by a relatively mild decrease in
          perfusion, especially with the pre-existing renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Clinicians may inadvertently produce this injury
          if diuretics are dosed according to the amount of
          peripheral edema or body weight without consideration of
          intravascular volume. This may be of particular concern
          in many critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypoalbuminemia.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may have coexisting total body volume
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overload</ENAMEX> and intravascular volume depletion.
          However, if volume status is monitored closely,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diuretics</ENAMEX> can be useful in the conversion to nonoliguria.
          This goal may be reasonable in certain situations and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are clearly easier to manage without volume
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overload</ENAMEX> and electrolyte imbalances. In this regard, loop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diuretics</ENAMEX> appear to be more effective and less toxic when
          given as a continuous infusion rather than as a bolus. In
          a randomized, crossover trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>] evaluated the
          effectiveness of continuous infusion 
          vs bolus dosing of bumetanide.
          Continuous infusion produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> mmol more net sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excretion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-80</NUMEX> mmol, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>), and less toxicity. It is
          also important to note that large bolus doses of loop
          diuretics may cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">transient renal vasoconstriction</ENAMEX>.
          Despite these potentially useful effects of diuretic
          therapy, there is no evidence that converting oliguria
          into nonoliguria is effective in reducing mortality or
          the need for dialysis. As detailed above, this question
          has now been evaluated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> randomized trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Medullary ischemia, renal blood flow and
          dopamine
          In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> occurs more commonly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          certain types of underlying physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>, relative hypovolemia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
          underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, hepatic
          cirrhosis, certain autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and malignancies)
          as well as in certain clinical settings (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, surgery,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trauma</ENAMEX>, drug-induced). Indeed, one of the most commonly
          anticipated etiologies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> is the use of iv contrast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for imaging studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Although the
          pathogenesis of renal injury secondary to radiocontrast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> is not entirely understood, it appears to be due
          to medullary ischemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 50</ENAMEX>]. For some time, it has
          been postulated that this ischemic injury occurs on the
          basis of decreased renal blood flow secondary to renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasoconstriction</ENAMEX>. It is therefore surprising that studies
          have now shown that renal blood flow actually increases
          with radiocontrast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. This has led some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
          to hypothesize that medullary ischemia is a demand-side
          phenomenon. In other words, the ionic load leads to
          medullary ischemia because the medullary cellular oxygen
          demand becomes greater than the supply [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51, 52</TIMEX>]. This
          aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal physiology</ENAMEX> also has implications for the
          use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> like dopamine.
          Like loop diuretics, dopamine is frequently used by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> to increase urine output in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> in the hope
          that such a maneuver might attenuate renal injury or
          improve survival. Much of the enthusiasm for this agent
          comes from the belief that dopamine increases renal blood
          flow and that such an outcome is in fact desirable.
          Additionally, clinicians often interpret an increase in
          urine output as proof that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assumptions are
          valid. Indeed, dopamine may increase urine output through
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate mechanisms. Dopamine stimulates both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopaminergic</ENAMEX> and adrenergic (both alpha and beta)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. As such, dopamine may affect renal blood flow
          by direct vasodilatation (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dopamine receptors</ENAMEX>), by
          increasing cardiac output (beta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>) or by
          increasing perfusion pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha receptors</ENAMEX>). At lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doses</ENAMEX>, particularly less than <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 μg/kg/min</ENAMEX>, the
          dopaminergic effects tend to predominate, although wide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> appears to exist across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and clinical
          conditions. In the appropriate clinical setting, any of
          these mechanisms might increase effective renal plasma
          flow and thus increase urine output. Under such
          conditions, the increase in urine output might well be
          indicative of improved renal function. However, dopamine
          may increase urine output by yet a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> mechanism, that
          of inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase at the tubular
          epithelial cell level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. The effect of this final
          mechanism is to increase sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">excretion</ENAMEX> and thereby
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diuresis</ENAMEX>. Thus, apart from its direct and indirect
          effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal vasculature</ENAMEX>, dopamine increases
          urine output because it is a diuretic.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natriuretic</ENAMEX>/diuretic effects of dopamine are of
          importance not only because they may lull clinicians into
          believing that they are improving renal function when
          they observe an increase in urine output with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>,
          but also because this increase in urine output may come
          with unexpected effects. Most `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>' use so-called
          'renal-dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dopamine</ENAMEX>' in the belief that they can improve
          renal blood flow and that this will restore oxygen
          delivery to portions of the kidney that are dysoxic.
          Unfortunately, as already discussed, the problem may not
          be remedied simply by increasing total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> blood flow.
          This is because the area of the kidney that is most at
          risk from ischemia is the very area least likely to
          benefit from dopamine infusion. This area is the outer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX>. Normally, outer medullary cells live on the edge
          of dysoxia. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Oxygen diffuses</ENAMEX> from the descending to
          ascending vasa recta within the vascular bundles limiting
          oxygen delivery to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal medulla</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. In addition
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medulla</ENAMEX> suffers from unusually high oxygen demand
          related to tubular transport activity (medullary oxygen
          extraction approaches <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> medulla
          is constantly on the brink of dysoxia owing to high
          demand and low delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>.
          Given these considerations, it is certainly
          understandable for clinicians to desire to increase renal
          blood flow in the hope of improving medullary oxygen
          delivery. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heyman</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> have recently demonstrated
          that although dopamine increased outer medullary blood
          flow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hypovolemic rat</ENAMEX>, it failed to improve outer
          medullary dysoxia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. In fact, analogous to the
          situation with radio-contrast, the increase in solute
          delivery to the distal tubular cells produced by the
          natriuretic effects of dopamine (via inhibition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> tubular reabsorption) might actually increase
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption and therefore increase rather
          than decrease the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ischemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>].
          With these `myths' of experimental evidence dispelled,
          or at least severely questioned, it is not surprising
          that clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect from dopamine infusion in the setting
          of treatment or prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> of this
          sort also call into question the appropriateness of
          increasing urine output in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. As we have
          seen with other types of diuretics, converting oliguric
          to nonoliguric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> may provide certain
          management advantages, but does not affect overall renal
          recovery or outcome. Accordingly, on the basis of
          existing evidence, the use of dopamine to improve renal
          function cannot be recommended. This is not to say that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> is not a useful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dopamine</ENAMEX>'s
          multiple effects (even at low doses) make it the perfect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pressor/inotropic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> when such a combination is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. It is a common clinical scenario in which a
          patient is both modestly hypotensive/vasodilated and has
          a degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac dysfunction</ENAMEX>. Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may well
          benefit from the combined inotropic, vasopressor, renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasodilator</ENAMEX> and diuretic effects of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. However,
          as always, when safer or less invasive alternatives are
          available, they should be used <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. For example, loop
          diuretics are much more effective diuretics than dopamine
          and are much safer. Similarly, dobutamine would be a
          better alternative for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who primarily requires
          an inotrope, and norepinephrine would be a better choice
          for a vasodilated, hyperdynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          Certainly, dopamine has a number of potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disadvantages</ENAMEX>. In a recent study, Segal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> demonstrated that low-dose
          dopamine caused earlier onset of gut ischemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. Even
          at low doses, dopamine may increase cardiac contractility
          and systemic resistance, and can cause tissue necrosis
          and digital gangrene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, even if dopamine
          were without risk, its effects can be unpredictable. This
          point was stressed by Flancbaum 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> , who demonstrated that
          low-dose infusion alone produces a drug-dependent
          increase in the urinary output in oliguric, euvolemic ICU
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and that the maximal effect is temporally
          variable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Given the fact that the renal effects of
          low-dose dopamine in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>
          decrease with time, it has been suggested that there is a
          desensitization of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal dopaminergic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          The above considerations argue against the routine use of
          'renal-dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dopamine</ENAMEX>' for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficiency</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Conclusions
          The use of diuretics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX> remains
          controversial despite several advances in the
          understanding of the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> and
          the mechanisms of action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> commonly used to
          manage it.
          At the present time the limited observational and
          experimental evidence available moderately supports the
          following guidelines:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For prophylaxsis against radiocontrast-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>,
          saline infusion should be administered for optimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydration</ENAMEX>; neither diuretics nor dopamine appear
          effective and may be harmful.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. For the prevention of ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATN</ENAMEX>, although animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest this intervention would be helpful, there
          are no human data to support the use of diuretics.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The use of 'renal-dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dopamine</ENAMEX>' has not been
          substantiated to improve outcome in human studies and may
          prove to be deleterious in certain clinical settings.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of rhabdomyolysis, loop diuretics
          should probably be avoided, although mannitol may be
          effective on the basis of level <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> evidence.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. When loop diuretics are used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARF</ENAMEX>, continuous infusion may be more efficacious than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bolus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in achieving diuresis. However,
          there is no evidence that this maneuver improves survival
          or renal recovery.
