        During positive inotropy there is an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        utilization and thus myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption related
        to increased cross-bridge cycling and calcium handling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . Heat measurements of isolated heart muscle have
        assigned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of total energy consumption to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-bridge cycling and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> to calcium cycling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, recently, studies in both isolated hearts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , examining the energetic effects of
        increasing inotropy with the calcium sensitizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> EMD
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57033</NUMEX> have suggested that the energetic cost associated
        with increasing inotropy is largely related to calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycling</ENAMEX>. In these studies <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">EMD 57033</ENAMEX> resulted in only small
        increases in myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption and this was
        felt related to the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMD</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57033</NUMEX> to increase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inotropy</ENAMEX> without increasing calcium cycling (though
        intracellular calcium was not directly measured).
        Consistent with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandes et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] have studied the
        contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to
        total mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis as measured by NADH
        levels using fluorescent spectroscopy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trabeculae</ENAMEX>. They concluded that there was an equal
        contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis. In the present study, we hypothesized
        that energy consumption during altered inotropy is largely
        to related calcium handling. To study this we directly
        measured developed pressures, myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
        and used a newly developed technique to measure
        intracellular calcium in perfused mouse hearts with the
        calcium sensitive fluorescent dye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rhod-2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] during
        calcium-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inotropy</ENAMEX> and with dobutamine. In addition
        we studied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart, as the ability to
        manipulate the murine genome will likely provide important
        information about the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determinants</ENAMEX> of energy
        consumption in the heart.
        The mechanisms controlling calcium-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inotropy</ENAMEX> are
        probably several fold, and include activation of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , of which several isoforms are calcium
        dependent. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein kinase</ENAMEX> C decreases maximal actomyosin
        MgATPase activity through phosphorylation of troponin I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] . This would be predicted to result in a reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> (or developed pressure) relative to intracellular
        calcium resulting in an energetically inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, we predicted that high perfusate calcium positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inotropy</ENAMEX> would result in lower developed pressures relative
        to both intracellular calcium and myocardial oxygen
        consumption compared to dobutamine, and that high perfusate
        calcium would be associated with evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
        C activation, though not dobutamine.
      
      
        Results
        During increases in perfusate calcium (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM)
        there were stepwise increases in developed pressure, and
        developed pressures with dobutamine were significantly
        higher than perfusate calcium <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5 mM</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). Peak
        systolic intracellular calcium increased minimally between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM despite significant increases in developed
        pressures indicating increased myofilament responsiveness
        to calcium at perfusate calcium <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Also, indicating reduced myofilament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to perfusate calcium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM compared to
        dobutamine, levels of peak intracellular calcium were
        similar for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> interventions despite higher developed
        pressure with dobutamine. Increases in myocardial oxygen
        consumption reflected the changes in peak intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX>, in that there were minimal changes between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium, and myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
        was not significantly different between perfusate calcium
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM and dobutamine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). Thus, the ratio of
        developed pressure to myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption, an
        index of economy of contraction, significantly increased
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium and was
        significantly higher with dobutamine compared to high
        perfusate calcium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>).
        To further explore the differences between dobutamine
        and high calcium positive inotropy, analysis of pressure
        and calcium transient waveforms and phase-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> plots
        relating pressure to calcium was performed. Pressure
        waveforms were significantly abbreviated with dobutamine
        compared to high perfusate calcium (total waveform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">duration: 100 ± 15 vs 125 ± 0 ms</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). The time
        from onset of the pressure waveform to peak pressure was
        not significantly different between dobutamine and high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 ± 3 vs 52 ± 7 ms</NUMEX>, p=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>), though the time from
        peak pressure to fall to baseline was significantly shorter
        with dobutamine compared to high calcium (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 ± 12</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73 ± 7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ms</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). An example of a normalized pressure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waveform</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. No significant differences
        were seen with calcium transient durations at any level of
        perfusate calcium or dobutamine (examples Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">3A,Band</ENAMEX>
        3C). Total transient duration at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium
        was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">106 ± 20 ms</NUMEX> and with dobutamine was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">93 ± 22 ms</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>),
        and there was also no significant difference in the time
        from onset of the transient to peak (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calcium 33 ± 8</ENAMEX> vs dobutamine <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 ± 14 ms</NUMEX>, p=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>), or
        difference in the duration between the peak of the
        transient to return to baseline (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 ± 25 vs dobutamine 60 ± 25 ms</TIMEX>, p=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>). Phase-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> plots
        illustrate that high perfusate calcium results in a similar
        increase in intracellular calcium compared to dobutamine
        though relatively smaller increase in pressure (Figure
        3D,E, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3F</ENAMEX>). Thus, the ratio of pressure to calcium at
        the point of peak systolic pressure is significantly higher
        with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.103</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.081</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmHg</ENAMEX>/nM, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
        increase in the 'dynamic trajectory' of the phase-plane
        plot between peak calcium and peak pressure may relate to
        underlying changes in the steady-state force-calcium
        relationship as proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        The specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine
        significantly inhibited high calcium positive inotropy (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), though had no effects on
        dobutamine, or with lower levels of perfusate calcium (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 mM</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). The effects of chelerythrine were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> through preventing the expected increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic intracellular calcium (figure 5B).
        The difference in myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium was significantly reduced with
        the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">chelerythrine (Δ 2.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM alone: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Δ 2.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5 mM</NUMEX> + chelerythrine: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">μmoles/min/g</ENAMEX> dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wt.</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Also, chelerythrine had
        no significant effects on developed pressures at a constant
        perfusate calcium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 mM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 ± 9 to 50 ± 10 mmHg</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p=NS</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Measurement of intracellular calcium and myocardial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart
          Isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart measurements of
          intracellular calcium and energetics have been performed
          using other methods by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
          The unique aspects of the present study are that we use
          the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye rhod-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to measure
          intracellular calcium [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , and that we have related
          these measurements to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocardial oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
          and developed pressure. An appreciation of the strengths
          and limitations of these techniques is required to
          critically evaluate the results. For instance,
          measurements of intracellular calcium are taken from the
          outer layers of the left ventricular free wall, though
          our measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocardial oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption and
          developed pressures are global measurements. Differences
          between the epicardium and endocardium have been
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and our measurements of intracellular
          calcium do not take this into account, and regional
          differences in myocardial strains and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
          are also not accounted for. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage of
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rhod-2</ENAMEX> is that its long excitation and emission
          wavelengths relative to other calcium sensitive dyes
          results in minimal filtering of excitation and emission
          light and autofluorescence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 20</ENAMEX> ] . At these visible
          range wavelengths light may penetrate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>
          mm into the myocardium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] which may be significantly
          deeper than shorter wavelength dyes. This is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the total wall thickness in the
          mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and thus our measurements are from the
          outer <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the myocardium.
          Measurements of intracellular calcium and myocardial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption have been performed in different
          hearts due to the difficulty in obtaining these
          measurements in a single experiment, and this may
          introduce variability into the results. We have also
          performed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 2 interventions</NUMEX> per heart. The time taken
          to obtain stable measurements of effluent oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturations</ENAMEX> used in the calculation of myocardial oxygen
          consumption is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 30 minutes</TIMEX> and the mouse
          heart preparation is usually not stable beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, so that only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> interventions can be obtained.
          Furthermore, when comparing different inotropes such as
          high calcium and dobutamine, it is desirable not to use
          the same heart. As we have postulated that different
          signaling pathways may be activated by these inotropes,
          serially administering these to a single heart may result
          in persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase even after
          washout of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
          Coronary flow does not increase with inotropes in this
          study, though other studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse hearts
          have shown an increase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The reason for this is
          unclear, though oxygen delivery to the heart is not
          compromised. We have the advantage with the use of the
          absorbance spectrum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 500 and 600</NUMEX> nm, used in the
          calculation of intracellular calcium, that this is also
          sensitive to the presence of deoxy- or oxygenated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myoglobin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . With our technique the myoglobin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrum</ENAMEX> is invariably consistent with full oxygenation
          and any (rare) hearts that do not show this pattern are
          discarded. By using physiological heart rates and
          temperatures we have attempted to reproduce normal murine
          physiological conditions. As the mouse heart has a
          negative force-frequency response at physiological heart
          rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , developed pressures in our studies are
          lower than might be expected with lower heart rates.
          Nevertheless, the developed pressures in this study are
          quite consistent with other studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 24 25</NUMEX> ] . That
          pressures in perfused mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart</ENAMEX> studies are generally
          low may relate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of the murine myocardium
          to extracellular calcium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Diastolic calcium
          levels are relatively high with this method especially
          with dobutamine or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM perfusate calcium (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          This appears at least in part related to the limited
          sampling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points per beat in the current paper,
          and may also relate to motion artifact associated with
          the positive inotropes. These limitations are especially
          prominent in the small and rapid beating mouse heart.
          Recently, improved analogue to digital capabilities and
          software acquisition has significantly improved our
          ability to record many more time points during the
          cardiac cycle, and with this we have noted slightly
          higher differences between peak and diastolic calcium
          levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacGowan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koretsky</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). It
          appears unlikely that this is related to a calcium
          overload <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as diastolic pressures do not rise with
          high perfusate calcium or dobutamine, and pressure
          waveforms abbreviate with dobutamine.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart, high perfusate calcium
        positive inotropy compared to dobutamine results in reduced
        myofilament calcium responsiveness, decreased energetic
        efficiency and is dependent in part on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. It must be recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that increase
        the amplitude of the calcium transient through activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase A, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphodiesterase inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        are associated with adverse outcomes in congestive heart
        failure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and so our findings with
        dobutamine are unlikely to translate into clinical benefit.
        Nevertheless, these results illustrate the importance of
        calcium handling in the energetic efficiency of an
        inotrope, and these methods will be useful in studying
        genetically engineered mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with altered
        myofilament calcium responsiveness.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          The isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart and myocardial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
          Experiments were performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          developed pressure and myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption were
          measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart. In another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          perfused hearts intracellular calcium and developed
          pressure were measured. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Male mice</ENAMEX> (129/SV ter strain,
          mean weight <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26.9 ± 2.6 g</NUMEX>) were used. Anesthesia was
          induced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> mg of intraperitoneal
          pentobarbital sodium, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was anticoagulated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> units of heparin. The heart was removed from the
          chest and the aorta was cannulated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> gauge
          needle. Retrograde coronary perfusion at a constant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> mmHg with oxygenated modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX> solution was started. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kreb</ENAMEX>'s solution consisted
          of (mM): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">112</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KCl 4.7</NUMEX>, MgSO

          CaCl 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 2.5</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μM</NUMEX> octanoate, and pH was
          adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>. For some studies the concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> was varied to produce an inotropic effect. The
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> was adjusted accordingly for these
          experiments to maintain osmolality. To eliminate the
          effects of cathecholamine release by pacing esmolol (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">μM</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DE</ENAMEX>) was added to the perfusate.
          The temperature of the perfusate entering the heart was
          set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>. Flow was monitored with a glass flow <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX>.
          A rubber latex <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX> on the end of a plastic cannula,
          was inserted into the left ventricle through an incision
          in the left <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium</ENAMEX>. This was then connected to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
          pressure recorder (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>) for
          measurement of left ventricular pressure. The left
          ventricular diastolic pressure was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 - 5 mm Hg</ENAMEX>
          using a micro-syringe. Hearts were paced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Hz which is
          physiological heart rate for the mouse, using a
          stimulator with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lead inserted into the right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventricle</ENAMEX> and the other adjacent to the epicardium. In
          the myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption experiments, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfused</ENAMEX> mouse heart was placed in a glass, water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jacketed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, which was sealed at the top. Myocardial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption was determined from influent and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">effluent oxygen</ENAMEX> content (measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> analyzer,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ABL-30</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Copenhagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>) and flow rate.
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intracellular Calcium</ENAMEX>
          The methods used to measure intracellular calcium with
          rhod-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in perfused hearts have been previously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extensively</ENAMEX> described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 20</NUMEX> ] . Rhod-2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Probes</ENAMEX>, OR, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg</ENAMEX>) was dissolved with dimethylsulfoxide
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 μL</ENAMEX>) and dH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 μL</ENAMEX>), and loaded through the
          coronary perfusate. After the washout period serial
          measurements of fluorescence alternating with absorbance
          were taken. Fluorescence scans were taken at high time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> to allow quantification of changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> during the cardiac cycle. Excitation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX> and emission at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">589</NUMEX> nm was used for fluorescence
          measurements.
          Quantification of the relative amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rhod-2</ENAMEX> in the
          heart using absorbance measurements, was done by taking
          the ratio of absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">524 nm</NUMEX> (rhod-2 sensitive) to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">589 nm</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rhod-2 insensitive</ENAMEX>) which eliminated the effect
          of motion as both wavelengths would be equally affected
          by motion, though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 524</TIMEX> reflected the concentration of
          rhod-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These wavelengths (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">524, 589 nm</ENAMEX>) were
          chosen as these were isosbestic points not effected by
          changes in absorbance of myoglobin induced by oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desaturation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> maximal rhod-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorbance</ENAMEX> is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">554</NUMEX> nm. However, this wavelength is
          effected by changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen saturation</ENAMEX>, the relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorbance</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX> nm is decreased due to inner
          filter effects and it does not adequately correct for
          changes in scattering [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Dye absorbance (A 
          rhod2 ) was calculated according to
          the formula:
          A 
          rhod2 = log{(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">524 /R</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">524 /R</ENAMEX>

          rhod2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">}    </ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          where R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">524</ENAMEX> is the reflectance intensity at
          the rhod-2 sensitive point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX> nm, and R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">589</ENAMEX> is the rhod-2 insensitive point,
          before () 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and after () 
          rhod2 loading.
          At the end of the perfusion protocol, maximal
          fluorescence, used in the calculation of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+]i was
          determined by tetanizing the heart with a bolus of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcium chloride</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 mM</NUMEX>) without any energy substrate,
          and with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclopiazonic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μM</NUMEX>),
          which is a potent inhibitor of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> and thus
          blocks calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescence</ENAMEX> and pressure were monitored
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuously</ENAMEX>, and the point of maximal fluorescence was
          taken as the point were pressure stabilized at a steady
          state. To account for changes in light scattering
          properties from the heart during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tetanization</TIMEX>, the
          maximal fluorescence was corrected by multiplying by the
          ratio of R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX> pre-tetanization to R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tetanization</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          Intracellular calcium was calculated using the
          formula:

          a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">rhod</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fluorescence in the
          absence of calcium / rhod-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fluorescence in the presence
          of saturating calcium. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rhod-2</ENAMEX> the value of 
          a is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0</NUMEX>, thus for
          rhod-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was assumed to be equal to F

          Interventions
          For each heart only a baseline and one intervention

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-90 minutes</TIMEX>, beyond which the preparation is not stable
          and so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1</NUMEX> intervention per mouse heart was not
          undertaken. In the developed pressure/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
          experiments, the following interventions were used: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          varying perfusate calcium from baseline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)

          C, the specific antagonist chelerythrine (ref <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM,

          the perfusate when inducing positive inotropy. In all of
          these the chelerythrine was added to the perfusate
          containing the higher level of perfusate calcium or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dobutamine</ENAMEX>. This dose was chosen to reduce the expected

          of perfusate calcium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM, chelerythrine was added
          without changing perfusate calcium concentration. In all
          experiments, the control period was followed by the
          intervention, and repeated measurements of both developed
          pressure and myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption were taken for
