          Introduction
          Based on ethnic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and international [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]
          differences in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk, and on results from
          cell and animal studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], a role for soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> prevention has been proposed. The
          epidemiologic investigations on soy and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          risk have so far produced conflicting results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Mammographic densities that refer to the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, connective, and epithelial tissue in
          the female breast have been shown to be related to breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. A high percentage of dense parenchyma
          on mammographic images appears to confer a fourfold risk
          of developing breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Aims
          The purpose of this report is to investigate the
          hypothesis that soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are related to lower
          mammographic densities among a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
          Caucasian, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX>
          ancestry living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Methods
          In a cross-sectional study approved by the
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review boards</ENAMEX> of all participating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with different ethnic backgrounds
          were recruited at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> mammography <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">island of Oahu</ENAMEX>. All study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> signed informed
          consent and completed a validated food frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> (FFQ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] especially designed for a
          multiethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> included
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food items</ENAMEX>, we designed a soy questionnaire
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> categories of soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that are commonly
          consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>: tofu, fried tofu, pressed tofu, green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>, miso, soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprouts</ENAMEX>, tofu skin, soy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk/drink</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetarian meats</ENAMEX>, and fermented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>.
          Intake of soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX> in a validation
          study among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was highly correlated with urinary
          isoflavone excretion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          Both cranio-caudal views of the mammogram were
          obtained from the mammography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> after the
          radiologic evaluation had been completed and any
          malignancy or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suspicious lesions</ENAMEX> ruled out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who
          reported a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> or augmentation
          surgery were excluded from the study. Computer-assisted
          mammographic density assessment was performed using a
          method that was first developed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and
          later modified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> first draws the outline
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> (using an outlining tool) and then searches
          for the best threshold gray level value 
          X where all pixels with values
          above 
          X are considered to represent
          mammographic densities. The pixel count corresponding to
          the area colored within the outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> is
          determined by the computer, as is the total area within
          the outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mammographic
          parameters for analysis: breast area (total area within
          the outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>), dense area (colored area),
          percent densities (the ratio of dense area and breast
          area), and the nondense area (the difference between the
          breast area and the dense area). Body mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>)
          was computed using the formula weight (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) divided by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">m 2</ENAMEX>). We calculated intraclass correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> (icc) and weighted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX> statistics (κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ) using quartile ranking to compare
          dietary intake from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questionnaires. After
          adjustment for total energy intake using the residual
          method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], we computed means for the mammographic
          parameters by quartile of soy intake. Trend tests
          regressing the mean of each category on soy intake were
          performed to investigate a possible relation between soy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and the mammographic parameters. Multiple linear
          regression with a stepwise selection procedure was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to explore the relation of soy intake, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and
          reproductive factors with mammographic parameters.
        
        
          Results
          Complete data were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">514</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, of whom
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one-half</NUMEX> were postmenopausal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Mean
          soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> intake was considerably higher according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX>, but the estimates from the two
          instruments were highly correlated. The icc for all soy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> combined was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.70</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>],
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX>) and κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.71</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX>). The
          same was true for tofu intake from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX> and the FFQ:
          the icc was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>) and κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.77</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.73</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>). The
          means of tofu intake for each ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as estimated
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dietary</ENAMEX> instruments, were very similar. We
          observed considerable ethnic differences in the
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Counting all soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> women
          reported nearly twice as high an intake as Caucasian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, the
          greatest caloric intake, and consumed more soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> than
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tofu</ENAMEX> and soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk/drinks</ENAMEX> were the most
          commonly reported soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. Green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX> and soybean
          sprouts were eaten in moderate amounts, whereas the other
          products, miso, tofu skin, Western vegetarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>, and
          fermented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>, were reported infrequently.
          All mammographic parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) except the size
          of the dense area were statistically significantly
          different by ethnicity ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Breast area,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nondense</ENAMEX> area, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities showed a significant
          trend by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calorie</TIMEX> adjusted quartiles of soy intake (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The average breast area and the nondense area were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25% smaller</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the highest soy
          intake category than among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the lowest category,
          whereas percent densities were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11% greater</NUMEX> with higher
          soy intake. The dense area appeared to be slightly
          smaller with increasing soy intake, but the trend test
          was not significant. We observed no significant trends in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> after we stratified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Dense area and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> showed a positive
          relation with soy intake. In a linear regression model,
          we observed a weak association between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calorie</TIMEX> adjusted
          soy intake and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities (partial regression
          coefficient 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) after adjustment for
          age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, parity, and family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. On
          the contrary, the size of the nondense area (ie the fatty
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>) was inversely related to soy intake
          after adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, age, and parity ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.06</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Discussion
          This study among healthy pre- and post-menopausal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who participated in mammography screening detected
          an inverse relation between self-reported soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> intake
          and the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, in particular the nondense
          area, as measured in mammographic images. Contrary to our
          hypothesis, we detected a positive association between
          soy intake and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities, and also higher levels
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
          are at lower risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. This could be
          interpreted as evidence that soy increases breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          risk as a result of its estrogenic effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. However,
          an alternate explanation may be that the size of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nondense</ENAMEX> area, which is inversely related to soy, is
          important in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk. Mammary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gland</ENAMEX> mass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] has been proposed as a risk factor for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> because of the higher number of ductal stem
          cells that develop as a result of intrauterine influences
          and high energy intake early in life. Although we did not
          collect information on childhood soy consumption, we wish
          to propose that soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, either by themselves or as
          part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> dietary pattern characterized by low fat,
          high cereal, low dairy and low red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat intake</ENAMEX>, may
          contribute to the ethnic differences in mammographic
          characteristics. The importance of childhood nutrition
          for adult anthropometric measures is supported by
          comparative growth studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          The finding of a nutritional effect on breast
          development before puberty agrees with the results from
          migrant studies demonstrating that it takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> to increase breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk. The time lag
          indicates that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> who were
          born and who grew up in the host <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will develop a
          similar risk as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host population</ENAMEX>, and that possible
          causes act early in life or 
          in utero [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Evidence exists in
          addition to suggestions from migration studies that
          exposures during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the perinatal period</TIMEX> and adolescence are
          important for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk later in life. A Western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, as opposed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> diet, may lead to increased
          body fat mass [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 21</ENAMEX>] during preadolescence mediated
          through more available sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, the
          high soy content of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> diets may inhibit the secretion
          of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> and its effects on body fat through the
          antiestrogenic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isoflavones</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          We purposefully did not adjust our analyses for
          ethnicity because we wished to explore nutritional
          factors that may determine the ethnic differences. The
          advantage of including several ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with
          different dietary habits was a greater variability in soy
          intake than could ever be found in an ethnically
          homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The higher percent densities
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do not necessarily contradict the
          mammographic density hypothesis. It appears from a
          case-control study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] that the relation between
          percent densities and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is of similar
          strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of different ethnicities, although
          density levels vary by ethnicity.
          Because of the lack of a lifetime history of soy
          intake in our study, we do not know whether soy
          consumption during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> life when breast development
          occurred was similar to the current intake. Caucasian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported soy intake probably started eating
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> later in life and not during childhood. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Soy</ENAMEX>
          may therefore have not had the opportunity to influence
          the appearance of their mammograms. Soy consumption,
          however, may be a marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
          ethnicity; an indicator for childhood nutritional
          patterns that include, but are not limited to, soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>.
          These dietary patterns may explain some of the
          anthropometric characteristics found in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
          In conclusion, this examination of mammographic
          characteristics detected some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>
          that suggest an influence of nutritional patterns on the
          development of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>. What implications, if
          any, these findings have for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk has to be
          determined in prospective or interventions studies that
          will investigate possible mechanisms of actions, such as
          hormone levels, differences in estrogen metabolism, other
          dietary parameters, and genetic polymorphisms.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk differs greatly by ethnicity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer incidence</ENAMEX> rates per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988-1992</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] (invasive cases only, age-adjusted to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Incidence rates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 23 and 31</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>
        (age-adjusted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Standard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>) have been
        reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] for the same period. The role of
        isoflavones contained in soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>, based on these risk
        differences and on results from cell and animal studies [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], has been investigated in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> prevention and
        produced conflicting results. A case-control study among
        Asian-American <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] detected a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> decreased risk of
        pre- and post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
        reported eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tofu</ENAMEX> more than once a week as compared with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who ate tofu less than once a month. In a study from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>], consumption of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> g or more soy products
        per day was protective in premenopausal but not in
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Studies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>] did not detect a protective effect of soy intake.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent studies reported a lower breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        risk with increasing isoflavonoid excretion in urine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>].
        Mammographic densities that refer to the distribution of
        fat, connective, and epithelial tissue in the female breast
        have been shown to be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        These densities are not abnormalities, but variations of
        healthy breast tissue. Fat appears dark on mammograms,
        whereas the radiographically light areas representing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> and connective tissue are relevant to breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk. A high percentage of dense parenchyma on
        mammographic images, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-75%</NUMEX> as compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of
        densities depending on the study, appears to confer a
        fourfold risk of developing breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The
        purpose of this report is to investigate the hypothesis
        that soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are related to lower mammographic densities
        among a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> ancestry living in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and data collection
          In a cross-sectional study design, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> receiving
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mammograms</ENAMEX> were recruited at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          mammography <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oahu</ENAMEX>. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinics</ENAMEX> together provide more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of all
          mammograms on the island (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Research Center of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). As a result of greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> insurance coverage among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>'s population [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]
          and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> legislative mandate for health plans to cover
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mammography</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> and
          older, self-reported mammography utilization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] has
          been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 70%</NUMEX>. Participation has been similar
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Human Subjects</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> and the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> of all participating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> approved the study protocol. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who did
          not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported a history of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or augmentation surgery, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with suspicious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> on the mammograms were excluded from the study,
          but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> taking oral contraceptives and hormone
          replacement therapy were eligible to participate.
        
        
          Dietary data collection
          All study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> signed informed consent and
          completed a validated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] especially designed for a
          multiethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> was
          self-administered and processed by optical scanning. The
          goal, as described in detail elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>], was to
          include a sufficient number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food items</ENAMEX> so that at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of the intake for nutrients of interest was
          captured. Analyses were performed to estimate intakes of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> macro- and micronutrients for every study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>. Basic nutrient data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] has been supplemented and
          continuously updated with information from local recipes
          that are consumed by the different ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. Unpublished data also found acceptable validity
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, in addition to a published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> soy
          food items, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> each for tofu and Western vegetarian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meats</ENAMEX>, we designed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an additional SQ</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> categories of
          soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods commonly</ENAMEX> consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>: tofu, fried tofu,
          pressed tofu, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>, miso, soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprouts</ENAMEX>, tofu
          skin, soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk/drink</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetarian meats</ENAMEX>, and fermented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>. Intake of soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX> in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validation</ENAMEX> study among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was highly correlated
          with urinary isoflavone excretion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Mammogram density assessment
          All participating mammography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> were accredited
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Radiology</ENAMEX>. Mammography was performed on
          dedicated mammographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with high contrast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mammographic</ENAMEX> film and dedicated film processing. All
          mammograms for this study were therefore of comparable
          quality. Both cranio-caudal views of the mammogram were
          obtained from the mammography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> after the
          radiologic evaluation had been completed and any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malignancy</ENAMEX> ruled out. The films were scanned into a PC
          using an X-ray digitizer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobrascan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CX-612-T</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiographic Digital Imaging</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Compton</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) at a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 dots per inch</NUMEX>. Computer-assisted
          mammographic density assessment was performed using a
          method that was first developed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and
          later modified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> first draws the outline
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> (using an outlining tool) and then searches
          for the best threshold gray level value 
          X where all pixels with values
          above 
          X are considered to represent
          mammographic densities. The pixel count corresponding to
          the area colored within the outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> is
          determined by the computer, as is the total area within
          the outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> were blinded to
          the identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> where the
          mammogram was taken. The correlation coefficient between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for the readings of the size of the dense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> mammographic parameters were used
          for analysis: breast area (total area within the outline
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>), dense area (colored area), percent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densities</ENAMEX> (the ratio of dense area and breast area), and
          the nondense area (the difference between the breast area
          and the dense area).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          We transformed non-normally distributed variables such
          as breast area, dense area, and calories using their
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">logarithms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was computed using the formula
          weight (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) divided by the height (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">m 2</ENAMEX>). Because breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk is low for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and
          high in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, we divided
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> into these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for analysis. The
          small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did not allow analysis for every
          ethnic group individually. The reason for including
          different ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> into this study was, more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, to increase variability in exposure (ie soy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intake</ENAMEX>) not to study the effect of soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> separately. We calculated icc and κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] using quartile ranking
          to compare dietary intake from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questionnaires. A
          categorical soy intake variable was created based on
          quartiles of the calorie adjusted soy intake as measured
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ. Adjustment</ENAMEX> for total energy intake used the
          residual method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. After entering soy intake into a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as the dependent variable and calories
          as the independent variable, we added the residuals from
          this model to the median caloric intake and to the
          intercept to obtain adjusted intake estimates. We then
          computed arithmetical means for the mammographic
          parameters by quartile of soy intake. Trend tests
          regressing the mean of each category on soy intake were
          performed to investigate a possible relation between soy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and the mammographic parameters. Multiple linear
          regression with a stepwise selection procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to explore the relation of soy intake, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and
          reproductive factors with mammographic parameters. All
          analyses were performed using PC-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS ®</ENAMEX>, release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.12</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute, Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Dietary intake
          Complete data were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">514</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, of whom
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one-half</NUMEX> were postmenopausal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> represented the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in this
          study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Educational achievement was fairly high
          across all ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> caloric intake
          were highest among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and lowest
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Mean soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> intake
          was considerably higher according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SQ</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX>,
          but the estimates from the two instruments were highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX>. The icc for all soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> combined was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.70</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX>) and κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.71</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX>). The
          same was true for tofu intake from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQ</ENAMEX> and the FFQ:
          the icc was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>) and κ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.77</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.73</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>). The
          means of tofu intake as estimated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dietary
          instruments were very similar for each ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          We observed considerable ethnic differences in the
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>.
          Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> consumed more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> than all other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, they reported the lowest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and soy intake.
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat intake</ENAMEX> was equally low in Caucasian
          as in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly twice as high</NUMEX> an intake as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
          counting all soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          however, consumed even more soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> than did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tofu</ENAMEX> and soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk/drinks</ENAMEX> were the most commonly
          reported soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. Green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX> and soybean sprouts
          were eaten in moderate amounts, whereas the other
          products, miso, tofu skin, Western vegetarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>, and
          fermented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybeans</ENAMEX>, were reported infrequently.
        
        
          Mammographic characteristics
          All mammographic parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) except the size
          of the dense area were statistically significantly
          different by ethnicity ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Breast area and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nondense</ENAMEX> area were considerably larger among Caucasian
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Although the dense areas were slightly smaller
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> descent, their percent densities
          were greater than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> women
          because of the smaller breast area among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
          descent.
        
        
          Soy intake and mammographic characteristics
          Breast area, nondense area, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities
          showed a significant trend by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calorie</TIMEX> adjusted quartiles
          of soy intake (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The average breast area and the
          non-dense area were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25% smaller</NUMEX> among women
          in the highest soy intake category than among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
          the lowest category, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>
          greater with higher soy intake. The dense areas appeared
          to be slightly smaller with increasing soy intake, but
          the trend test was not significant. We observed no
          significant trends in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> women
          after we stratified by ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Dense areas and
          percent densities among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> showed a weak positive relation with soy intake.
          Excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 800</TIMEX> calories or
          more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> calories did not change these results
          substantially. We obtained similar results in a linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with adjustment for confounding
          variables. Whereas we did not observe a relation between
          soy intake and the size of the dense areas, we found an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between calorie</TIMEX> adjusted soy intake and
          percent densities ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) after adjustment for
          age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, parity, and family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. On
          the contrary, the size of the nondense area (ie the fatty
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>) was inversely related to soy intake
          after adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, age, and parity ( 
          b = - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>). The effects were in the
          same direction for pre- and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but
          they were stronger for postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This study among healthy pre- and postmenopausal women
        who participated in mammography screening detected an
        inverse relation between self-reported soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> intake and
        the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, in particular the non-dense area,
        as measured in mammographic images. Contrary to our
        hypothesis, we detected a positive association between soy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> densities, and also higher levels of
        percent densities among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are
        at lower risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. This could be interpreted
        as evidence that soy increases breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk as a
        result of its estrogenic effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. An alternative
        explanation, however, may be that the size of the nondense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, which is inversely related to soy, is important in
        determining <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk. Mammary gland mass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]
        has been proposed as a risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        because of the higher number of ductal stem cells that
        develop as a result of intrauterine influences and high
        energy intake early in life. Although we did not collect
        information on childhood soy consumption, we wish to
        propose that soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, either by themselves or as part of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> dietary pattern characterized by low fat, high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cereal</ENAMEX>, low dairy and low red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat intake</ENAMEX>, may contribute
        to the ethnic differences in mammographic characteristics.
        Dietary patterns, as shown in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>], can be identified from nutritional information using
        factor analysis. We purposefully did not adjust our
        analyses for ethnicity because we wished to explore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> factors that may determine the ethnic
        differences.
        We hypothesize, as a possible mechanism of how soy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> may affect mammographic characteristics, that soy
        intake during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">developmental years</TIMEX> may be responsible for
        the smaller fat component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> through an effect
        of soy on the growth of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> during that
        period. The importance of childhood nutrition for adult
        anthropometric measures is supported by comparative growth
        studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. A nutritional effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> development
        before puberty agrees with the results from migrant studies
        demonstrating that it takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> to
        increase breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. The time lag
        indicates that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> who were
        born and who grew up in the host <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will develop a
        similar risk as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host population</ENAMEX>, and that possible
        environmental and behavioral causes act early in life or 
        in utero [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. In addition to
        suggestions from migration studies, evidence exists that
        exposures during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the perinatal period</TIMEX> and adolescence are
        important for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk later in life. The
        occurrence of high risk mammographic patterns, for example,
        was associated with the weight of the placenta, the main
        estrogen-producing organ during pregnancy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. A Western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, as opposed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> diet, may lead to increased
        body fat mass [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 21</ENAMEX>] during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preadolescence</TIMEX>, mediated
        through more available sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>. The high soy content
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> diets may alternatively inhibit the secretion of
        sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> and its effects on body fat through the
        antiestrogenic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isoflavones</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        The higher percent densities among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do not
        necessarily contradict the mammographic density hypothesis.
        It appears from a recent case-control study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] that the
        relation <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between percent</NUMEX> densities and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is of
        similar strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of different ethnicities although
        density levels vary by ethnicity. Although the relation of
        soy intake and mammographic densities has not been
        investigated previously, several dietary studies have shown
        weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between micro- and macronutrients and
        mammographic densities. Energy-adjusted saturated fat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> was positively related, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> and carotenoids
        were inversely related to mammographic densities in a
        case-control study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> of density decreased by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.1%</NUMEX> in the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX> in
        the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, during a low fat intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and saturated fat intake, in particular,
        predicted a decrease in mammographic density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Higher
        fat intake [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
        levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] were related to denser mammographic patterns,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk may be related to blood
        lipid levels. Small differences in mammographic densities
        across levels of vitamin B 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> , C, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> as well as polyunsaturated
        fat intake were described recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] from a large
        cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Differences in the quality of films between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> may have introduced some measurement error. To
        minimize the subjective component of the assessment method,
        we spent much effort in training the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and compared
        the results between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> frequently. The high
        correlation coefficient indicates a high level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX> in mammographic assessment. Given the
        measurement errors in dietary and mammographic density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, the multi-factorial determination of
        mammographic densities, and the recall bias inherent to all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dietary</ENAMEX> studies, it is difficult to identify a small
        effect. Because the soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> relation was the primary aim
        in the proposal for this study, we did not search for
        positive results among a multitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food items</ENAMEX>, but
        focused on the soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
        The lack of a lifetime history of soy intake and the
        cross-sectional design limit our study's ability to
        establish causal relations. The dietary assessment asked
        only about intake during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. We therefore do not
        know whether soy consumption during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> life when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> development occurred was similar to the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported soy intake
        probably started eating these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> later in life and not
        during childhood, soy may have not had the opportunity to
        influence the appearance of their mammograms. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Soy</ENAMEX>
        consumption may, however, be a marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> ethnicity; an indicator for childhood nutritional
        patterns that include, but are not limited to, soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>.
        These dietary patterns may explain some of the
        anthropometric characteristics found in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        One strength of this study was the opportunity to
        investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with different ethnicity living in a
        similar environment that has a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> available
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with all ancestries. The advantage of including
        several ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with different dietary habits was a
        greater variability in soy intake than could ever be found
        in an ethnically homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> of
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the
        majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> also lived through adolescence under
        similar conditions. The comparable socioeconomic status and
        equal access to mammography screening among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> ancestry also offered a unique
        opportunity to compare mammographic parameters. In
        conclusion, this examination of mammographic
        characteristics detected some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>
        that suggest an influence of nutritional patterns on the
        development of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>. What implications, if
        any, these findings have for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk has to be
        determined in prospective or interventions studies that
        will investigate possible mechanisms of actions, such as
        hormone levels, differences in estrogen metabolism, other
        dietary parameters, and genetic polymorphisms.
