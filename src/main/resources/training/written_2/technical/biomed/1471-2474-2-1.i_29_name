        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> following total hip and knee arthroplasty are
        at a significant risk for thromboembolic complications.
        Despite modern prophylaxis against thromboembolism, studies
        still report a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 to 40%</NUMEX> frequency of deep venous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX> and a significant rate of pulmonary embolism
        following total hip or knee arthroplasty [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] ]. The
        high incidence of thrombotic disease despite prophylaxis
        makes early detection imperative, as treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anticoagulation</ENAMEX> is highly effective [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> manifest few specific clinical signs or
        symptoms, making the clinical diagnosis neither sensitive
        nor specific [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] ]. A high index of suspicion based
        on risk stratification is necessary for the detection and
        appropriate implementation of diagnostic studies to
        identify this complication. The ability preoperatively to
        identify a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing adult
        reconstructive surgery that are at a higher risk of
        developing thromboembolic complications would aid the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX> in making an accurate diagnosis and make possible
        further research to determine optimal regimes of
        postoperative detection and prophylaxis.
        Until recently, the only known hypercoagulable states
        were several rare genetic disorders of the coagulation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> (antithrombin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C, and protein S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>), which accounted for only a small percentage of
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with venous thrombosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahlback et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] described a previously unreported
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hypercoagulable</ENAMEX> state among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that
        suffered from recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">venous thrombosis</ENAMEX>. Further
        investigation revealed an autosomal-dominant inherited
        defect in the anticoagulant function of factor V resulting
        in resistance to the anticoagulant action of activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein C</ENAMEX> (APC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Formal evidence for this association
        came from a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-control study,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leiden Thrombophilia Study</ENAMEX>, which followed 474
        consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 70 years of age</TIMEX> with a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> episode of objectively confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVT</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty-eight percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7%</NUMEX> of controls were found to be APC-resistant.
        Furthermore, it was estimated that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have a
        sevenfold greater risk of developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVT</ENAMEX>. The abnormal
        factor V that causes APC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was subsequently termed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">factor V Leiden</ENAMEX>. Later studies confirmed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-
        to-eightfold increased risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> heterozygous for
        the factor V mutation and an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-fold increased risk in
        homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> is
        therefore the most common thrombophilic disorder described,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times more common than all the other genetic
        coagulopathies combined, with an estimated prevalence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 15</ENAMEX>].
        Polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme have
        also been associated with a hypercoaguable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The
        angiotensin converting enzyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>) digests angiotensin I
        to angiotensin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasoconstrictor</ENAMEX>) and is thus
        involved with the regulation of vascular tone. The
        angiotensin converting enzyme has also been shown to
        attenuate fibrinolysis and affect both platelet activation
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE gene</ENAMEX> has been found to have
        a polymorphism consisting of an insertion and a deletion of
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX> base pair fragment of intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> may
        thus be of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate genotypes;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">insertion/insertion, deletion/deletion</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">insertion/deletion.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with the deletion/deletion
        genotype have been shown to have mean plasma ACE levels of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> twice that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">insertion/insertion</ENAMEX> genotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deletion/</ENAMEX>deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> may be at increased risk for
        thromboembolic events.
        Although the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing total hip
        and knee arthroplasty are subjected to similar
        perioperative risk factors that predispose to
        thromboembolism, only a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> develop this
        complication. The objective of this study was to determine
        whether the FVL mutation or the deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE gene</ENAMEX> is associated with a higher risk of developing
        a postoperative thromboembolic complication.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          The presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation and the
          deletion-deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> of the angiotensin
          converting enzyme gene were determined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          who developed symptomatic pulmonary embolism (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) or proximal deep venous thrombosis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>)
          following elective total hip or knee arthroplasty at our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between February of 1997 and July of 1999</TIMEX>.
          The prevalence of these genetic profiles was compared to
          a control cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">241</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had undergone
          similar procedures between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1997 and March</TIMEX> of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> and whose postoperative
          course was not complicated by symptomatic thromboembolism
          using an unmatched case-control design. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</NUMEX>
          elective total hip and knee arthroplasties were performed
          during the time period that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for the control group
          were collected, however <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> chose not to
          participate in the study and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were discharged
          to home prior to sample collection. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were clinically suspected of deep vein
          thrombosis but had a single negative duplex ultrasound of
          the lower-extremities were also excluded from the
          analysis.
          Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on the basis of
          clinical symptoms and signs combined with a high
          probability ventilation-perfusion scan in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 of the 30</TIMEX>, a
          positive pulmonary angiogram in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>, a positive high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution chest CT</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> and an intermediate probability
          ventilation-perfusion scan combined with a high clinical
          suspicion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 proximal</NUMEX> deep venous thrombosis was
          diagnosed by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex ultrasonography</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> and contrast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venography</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. Thirty-one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          treated with intravenous heparin followed by oral
          warfarin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> by placement of an inferior vena caval and
          oral warfarin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> by placement of an inferior vena
          caval filter followed by intravenous heparin and oral
          warfarin
          Demographic and operative information including
          relevant past medical history and the type of
          thromboembolic prophylaxis utilized was collected for the
          experimental and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          Approval was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>
          at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> prior to initiating this study and all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> signed informed consent prior to participating
          in the study.

        Assuming an unmatched case control design with alpha = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
        and beta = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX>, post-hoc power analysis was performed to

        Results
        A comparison between the experimental and control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> revealed that they were of comparable age and sex

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). A significant difference was noted
        however in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>). Post-hoc power analysis revealed that with the

        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation being associated with a
        higher risk of thromboembolic complications was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX>.
        Similarly there was no difference detected in the
        distribution of polymorphisms for the Angiotensin
        Converting Enzyme gene with the deletion-deletion genotype
        present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">241</NUMEX> controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>. Odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>
        with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>). Post-hoc power
        analysis revealed that with the number of subjects
        available, the minimum detectable risk for the
        deletion-deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE gene</ENAMEX> being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a higher risk of thromboembolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have examined the relationship between
        inherited hypercoagulable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and thromboembolism
        following total hip and knee arthroplasty with mixed
        results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowe et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V</ENAMEX> Leiden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> was associated with an increased risk of deep
        venous thrombosis (as determined by routine bilateral
        ascending venography) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
        undergone total hip arthroplasty, however <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 41</NUMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with deep venous thrombosis had proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Svensson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] found that among a cohort of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had undergone hip arthroplasty,
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were heterozygous for the factor V
        Leiden mutation had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold increased risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> felt, however, that based on their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, no definite association between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V</ENAMEX> Leiden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and postoperative thrombosis could be made. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryan et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">825</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
        routine bilateral ascending venography following total hip
        and knee arthroplasty and found that the prevalence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation was no different between patients
        who did and did not have venographic evidence of deep
        venous thrombosis. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] studied
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had a proximal deep venous thrombosis after
        total hip arthroplasty (detected by routine predischarge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> ultrasound) and found that the
        prevalence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> was no different in that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> controls. In contrast to the
        aforementioned studies, the present report studied patients
        who had developed symptomatic thromboembolic events (the
        majority of which were pulmonary embolism) and were all
        treated with a uniform thromboembolic prophylaxis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
        Our results support the findings of others, that in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving pharmacological prophylaxis against
        postoperative thrombosis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation is
        not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thromboembolism</ENAMEX> following total hip or knee
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthroplasty</ENAMEX>.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillip et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] found no association between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation and deep venous thrombosis,
        they did find that the deletion-deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> of the
        angiotensin converting enzyme was strongly associated with
        postoperative venous thrombosis in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
        undergone total hip arthroplasty (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> of whom had a
        thromboembolic event as detected by routine compression
        duplex ultrasound). They concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deletion/</ENAMEX>deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> were at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increased risk
        for a thromboembolic event following total hip arthroplasty
        as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the insertion-insertion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had
        isolated distal deep venous thrombosis (which is of
        questionable clinical significance) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX> had a
        pulmonary embolism. While the results of this study had
        encouraged us to screen our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> for these
        polymorphisms, when utilizing a more relevant clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> (symptomatic pulmonary embolism or deep venous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX>) we were unable to confirm this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        Due to the relative infrequence of symptomatic
        thromboembolic events while using pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as
        prophylaxis, an unmatched case-control study design was
        employed. This type of study design has the advantage of
        increased statistical power for studying relatively rare
        events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. However, its disadvantages include the
        possibility that other variables that were not controlled
        for could have affected our results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both
        the case and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were operated on during
        overlapping time periods and were found to be
        demographically similar, and thus we do not believe that
        such confounding variables affected our results. Our power
        analysis reveals that a relatively strong association
        between these genetic profiles and postoperative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thromboembolism</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX> fold increased risk for the factor V
        Leiden mutation and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> fold increased risk for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deletion/</ENAMEX>deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> of the angiotensin
        converting enzyme gene) would have been required to detect
        a significant difference between the prevalence of these
        mutations in our case and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Likewise, a
        larger number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would have been required to find
        a significant difference if a weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was
        assumed. However, no trend was detected in our data to
        suggest that such an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was present. Furthermore,
        such a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> would make preoperative screening
        and identification of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not cost effective.
        It was noted however, that a significantly greater
        percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who suffered a thromboembolic event
        had a personal or family history of thromboembolism (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX> for both). The report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]
        included similar findings. Although residual abnormalities
        of the deep venous system could account for the higher
        prevalence of a personal history of prior deep venous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX> or pulmonary embolism, the higher prevalence of
        a family history of thromboembolic events suggests that an
        as yet undescribed genetically determined hypercoagulable
        state or predisposition may be present in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The objective of this study was to determine whether a
        specific genetic profile is associated with a higher risk
        of developing a postoperative thromboembolic complication.
        Although our results suggest that neither of these
        potentially hypercoaguable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are associated with an
        increased risk of symptomatic thromboembolic events
        following total hip or knee arthroplasty in patients
        receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, an as yet
        undescribed genetically determined hypercoagulable state or
        predisposition may be present in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
