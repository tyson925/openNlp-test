        Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that
        infect a variety of host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and exhibit individual
        tissue tropisms within a host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The availability of
        complete genomic sequences for different species has
        provided a contemporary impetus for research to uncover
        specific relationships of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlamydial genes</ENAMEX> with the disease
        process, an impetus that is particularly welcome because
        the fastidious growth requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> have
        made it relatively intractable to experimentation. A number
        of analyses dealing with the comparative genomics of the
        chlamydiae have appeared in the recent literature [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].
        Chlamydiae all progress through a life cycle that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intimately</ENAMEX> tied to success as a pathogen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is
        invaded by elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (EBs), which represent the
        extracellular infectious stage. The newly established EBs
        develop into intracellular reticulate bodies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBs</ENAMEX>) that
        replicate in anticipation of maturation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBs</ENAMEX>, which then
        lyse the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and initiate a new round of pathogen
        proliferation. Aggressive progress through repetitions of
        this cycle characterizes the acute disease process.
        Distinct changes in cell size, chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>,
        membrane characteristics and metabolic competence
        constitute endpoints of a reversible developmental profile.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> metabolic stage called persistence is increasingly
        recognized to attend the chronic disease process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The
        persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> can be induced 
        in vitro in tissue culture in
        response to various environmental cues such as nutrient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, antibiotic treatment or presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon-γ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. All of the latter may act to
        trigger persistence by eliciting a degree of metabolic
        starvation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In fact, it has been shown [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] that even
        normal blood plasma concentrations of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are
        sufficiently limiting to infected cell cultures to promote
        the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Cells present in the persistent state
        have been detected 
        in vivo, for example, in the synovial
        membranes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with Chlamydia-associated reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Chlamydial cells poised in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
        metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">latency</ENAMEX> exist as viable but non-cultivable cells
        that are 'abnormally' enlarged and which exhibit
        distinctive morphological characteristics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> protective responses to
        chlamydial infections has been the production of the
        T-cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX> This
        cytokine induces a variety of biochemical changes in host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, apparently designed to thwart the ability of
        intracellular parasites to gain access to host resources.
        Relative sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ varies, with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci being relatively
        resistant compared to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and the various 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis serovars. The relative
        insensitivity 
        in vivo of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum, compared to human
        strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis, is supported by the
        results of Cotter 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Conflicts in the
        literature about the sensitivities of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum isolates to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ-mediated inhibition have been attributed to strain
        variation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. A well documented effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> has been
        its ability to decrease the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells. (Other anti-chlamydial effects involve the
        inducible synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> and deprivation of iron
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].) Although effective L-tryptophan starvation may
        resolve an acute infection, a more modulated degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">starvation for L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan is thought to be intimately
        involved in the phenomenon of persistence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Thus,
        tryptophan limitation is increasingly recognized as an
        important factor in a variety of chronic disease
        conditions. As initially shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>] and confirmed by
        others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> acts by inducing indoleamine
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-dioxygenase, a host enzyme that converts L-tryptophan
        to L-formylkynurenine. (This broad-specificity monomeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is different from the non-homologous tryptophan
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-dioxygenase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and brain tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].) In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ is a potent inducer of host
        tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> not only
        decreases the pool of tryptophan available to intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, but the remaining tryptophan molecules tend to
        be increasingly sequestered by the elevated level of host
        tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.
        The biological relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ, indoleamine
        dioxygenase, tryptophan limitation and the persistent state
        of intracellular parasitism extends beyond chlamydial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, as illustrated by consideration of 
        Toxoplasma gondii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. This
        unicellular protozoan is a eukaryotic intracellular
        parasite that is subject to tryptophan limitation by
        exactly the same host mechanism used against the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlamydiae</ENAMEX>. The result is a generally widespread and
        asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of chronic infection. Even extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such as group B streptococci (tryptophan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">auxotrophs</ENAMEX>) are inhibited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ mechanism of
        tryptophan limitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In this context, it may be no
        accident that pathogens such as 
        Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus
        ducreyi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clostridium</ENAMEX> difficile and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cl</ENAMEX>. perfringens are conspicuous
        tryptophan auxotrophs that maintain full competence for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX> and tyrosine biosynthesis. The broad
        biological impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> tryptophan catabolism is further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the hypothesis that tryptophan catabolism
        localized in placental tissue provides a mechanism
        (suppression of lymphocyte proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]) to prevent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> rejection of the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. An
        additional example of the far-reaching consequences of host
        tryptophan catabolism is illustrated by the potential for
        persistent immune activation to disrupt the balance between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serotonin</ENAMEX> and kynurenine production from tryptophan, thus
        linking the immunological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and neuropsychiatric
        consequences of serotonin imbalance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Dynamic gene reorganization and gene flux within
          the chlamydial plasticity zones
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci of tryptophan-pathway
          genes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trp</ENAMEX> ), the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> gene 
          lifA, a perforin-family gene, and a
          conserved hypothetical gene that is specific to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. pneumoniae/C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">psittaci</ENAMEX> lineage. 
          lifA, the 
          trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the perforin-encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and a few other genes can be generally recognized as
          interspecies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of a 'plasticity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>' located
          near the terminus of replication [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. As Read 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] pointed out, dynamic
          events of gene shuffling, gene insertion and gene loss
          are apparent within this plasticity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>. They discussed
          the lack of variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and the absence of
          evidence for gene transfer, as well as the variation of
          tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Substantial variation is also striking with respect to
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. psittaci</ENAMEX> possesses a
          single copy of 
          lifA, C. muridarum has three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paralog</ENAMEX> copies, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis has a single
          pseudogene with frameshift mutations and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pneumoniae</ENAMEX> lacks 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lifA</ENAMEX> altogether. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX> (lymphocyte inhibitory factor)
          encodes a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> that can block production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX>
          It therefore undermines the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s ability to deplete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> through induction of indoleamine dioxygenase. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX> is of limited phylogenetic
          distribution, being present elsewhere only in
          enteropathogenic strains of 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The effect
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ is dose-dependent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>], and different
          concentration ranges have been shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] to allow rapid
          progress through the acute infection cycle (low IFN-γ
          concentration), to promote a stable state of persistence
          (medium IFN-γ concentration), or to completely resolve
          the infection (high IFN-γ concentration). Thus, to the
          extent that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX> is considered to be a factor, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">muridarum</ENAMEX> presumably has a
          maximal capability to block induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ, whereas 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci has only a partial
          ability to block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ induction via 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX>. The amino-terminal portion of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifA</ENAMEX> (which includes the remnant of
          
          lifA remaining in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis ) is homologous to
          the gene encoding a clostridial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>, and Belland 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] have recently
          demonstrated cytotoxic activities in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis D that are
          indistinguishable from those mediated by clostridial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toxin B. Cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> was dose dependent with respect to 
          lifA copy number. Belland 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] note that if the
          chlamydial cytotoxin inhibits lymphocyte activation (as
          does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LifA</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ), it would provide a
          mechanism for immune evasion.
          Within the plasticity zone shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci has an operon
          arrangement of genes encoding a nearly complete pathway
          of tryptophan biosynthesis. In contrast, the plasticity
          zone of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of tryptophan biosynthesis ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> ), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum has no
          tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at all [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. In addition, both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muridarum</ENAMEX> have a 
          trpC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> outside of the plasticity
          zone. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae has no
          tryptophan-pathway genes present anywhere in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Novelty of the tryptophan operon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          psittaci
          The pathway of tryptophan <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> consists of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> steps, and we have used the convention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] of
          naming the genes in the order of the steps, 
          trpA, trpB, trpC, trpD and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpE</ENAMEX>. The α and β subunits of 
          trpA are named 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb, and the α and β subunits of 
          trpE are named 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb</ENAMEX>. This nomenclature is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logical</ENAMEX>, easy to remember and suited to the modern era of
          comparative genomics, where gene naming needs to be
          consistent and to correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at the level of
          catalytic domain (subunit). Thus, 
          trpAaAbBCDEaEb corresponds to the
          conventional 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> designations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEGDFCAB</ENAMEX>. 
          The tryptophan operon in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci is incomplete in that
          genes encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits of anthranilate synthase
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> ) are absent. These genes are
          not present elsewhere in the genome. Hence, no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> connection with chorismate as a beginning
          substrate for tryptophan biosynthesis is apparent (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The tryptophan operon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psittaci</ENAMEX> exhibits further
          striking aspects of novelty. Not only does it contain
          genes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kynU</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kprS</ENAMEX> ) that are not components of
          the classical tryptophan operon, but these genes are not
          even present in other chlamydiae. 
          kynU encoding kynureninase and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kprS</ENAMEX> (alternative name: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prsA</ENAMEX> ) encoding PRPP synthase are
          located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci trp operon (see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These genes, together with 
          trpB, trpD, trpC, trpEb and 
          trpEa, comprise a compact operon in
          which all but one gene overlaps its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operon</ENAMEX> (translational coupling). A regulatory gene, the 
          trpR repressor, precedes the
          tryptophan operon on the amino-terminal side. A second
          paralog of the tryptophan synthase β subunit ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpEb-2</ENAMEX> ) is also present in an
          extra-operonic location several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upstream of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX>. The possible functional
          significance of this paralog as serine deaminase has been
          discussed elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Host-parasite</ENAMEX> metabolic mosaic for tryptophan
          cycling
          A rationale for inclusion of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kprS</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kynU</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci tryptophan operon can
          be visualized from an examination of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
          ability of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci to synthesize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-tryptophan</ENAMEX> requires an alternative source of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthranilate</ENAMEX> (other than chorismate) as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">psittaci</ENAMEX> lacks anthranilate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>. Kynurenine, intercepted from the host stream of
          catabolism, would satisfy this requirement given the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KynU</ENAMEX>. PRPP input is required for the
          TrpB-catalyzed step, and thus it was necessary for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci to recruit PRPP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kprS</ENAMEX> ) to the operon. The import of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (substrate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRPP</ENAMEX> synthase) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is also
          probably needed, and the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> translocases in
          chlamydial genomes has been documented [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>].
          Alternative sources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, for example, utilization of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX> by pyruvate kinase, are not altogether ruled out [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. Finally, serine import is required for the
          tryptophan synthase step as chlamydiae are not competent
          for serine biosynthesis.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2illustrates</NUMEX> the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">'kynurenine</ENAMEX>' pathway
          of tryptophan catabolism, which is prominent in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>. The initial step is rate limiting and is
          catalyzed by either of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes: indoleamine
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,3-dioxygenase or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase</NUMEX>. The latter
          is the true catabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, has narrow specificity for
          tryptophan, and is inducible in the presence of
          tryptophan, glucocorticoids and heme cofactor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. In
          contrast, indoleamine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-dioxygenase has broad substrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> and is capable of depleting low-to-normal
          concentrations of tryptophan if induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX> The
          overall host metabolism of tryptophan shown in Figure
          2reflects a general potential that is not necessarily
          realized in all cell types. The ultimate catabolic
          process to generate acetyl-CoA is a feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and
          kidney organ systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-Amino-3-carboxymuconate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">semialdehyde</ENAMEX> can be considered to be a branchpoint
          metabolite that either enters committed catabolism to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetyl-CoA</ENAMEX> or that enters biosynthesis to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD +/NADP</ENAMEX> +.
          In the central nervous system, a number of
          kynurenine-pathway metabolites are neuroactive and appear
          to be involved in inflammatory neurological diseases [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinolinate</ENAMEX> can cause excitotoxic neuronal death.
          Kynurenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, derived from kynurenine by
          transamination, can antagonize the effect of quinolinate.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydroxykynurenine</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyanthranilate have been
          shown to cause apoptotic or necrotic neuronal death in
          cell cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. In glioblastoma cells (and
          apparently in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>) kynurenine is an
          endpoint of tryptophan catabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In human
          macrophages kynurenine is further metabolized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
          Indoleamine dioxygenase is a rate-limiting step of
          tryptophan catabolism, and other steps are not known to
          be induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hydroxykynurenine</ENAMEX> is a prominent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolite</ENAMEX> in the eye lens (it absorbs UV radiation) and
          probably supports eye pigmentation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iris</ENAMEX>/ciliary
          body [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
          Hence, in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, kynurenine is a
          largely dead-end product of tryptophan catabolism,
          whereas it has a variety of metabolic fates in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. In either case, kynurenine generally exhibits a
          conspicuous pool size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Thus, although 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci apparently cannot
          utilize chorismate (for which it has an intact
          biosynthetic pathway) as a precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan, it
          has the potential to synthesize its own supply of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-generated kynurenine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-serine.
          It is of interest that the conversion of kynurenine to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthranilate</ENAMEX> and the conversion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxykynurenine to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyathranilate are similar hydrolytic reactions.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> enzyme catalyzing the latter reaction is, in
          fact, a kynureninase which is a homolog of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. psittaci KynU</ENAMEX>. Kynureninases
          have been reported to possess a range of substrate
          specificities that vary between very high specificity for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kynurenine</ENAMEX> and very high specificity for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-hydroxykynurenine.</TIMEX> The kynureninase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX> has an order-of-magnitude preference for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxykynurenine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], in contrast to a microbial
          kynureninase that exhibits a very high preference for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kynurenine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. It seems likely that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. psittaci KynU</ENAMEX> is specific for
          kynurenine, whereas the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> may possess
          isozymes of different substrate specificity in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>.
          An intriguing possible layer of additional complexity
          involves a competitive relationship between indoleamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dioxygenase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> (NO) synthase (type II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX>), which are both induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX> In murine
          macrophages, induction of NO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synthase</ENAMEX> requires at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional stimulus (such as bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (LPS)) that acts synergistically with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and references therein). Metabolite flow to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +is proportional to the input availability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> in murine macrophages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Under conditions
          in which there is induction of both indoleamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dioxygenase</ENAMEX> and NO synthase, an interplay of potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-pathway inhibitions are set in motion as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> inhibits
          indoleamine dioxygenase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. On the other hand,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyanthranilate inhibits both the expression and
          activity of NO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. Thus, small-molecule
          products of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> can be mutually inhibitory.
          Consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci has parasitized a host
          niche where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyanthranilate is a prominent
          metabolite, as in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The withdrawal
          of kynurenine from this flow route might undermine the
          levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyanthranilate sufficiently to release
          the restraints on NO synthase. The consequent increase in
          nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> production might then tend to limit the
          availability of kynurenine as a result of inhibition of
          indoleamine dioxygenase. Although this might at first
          seem an unfavorable outcome for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci parasitism, a finite
          but minimal supply of kynurenine might satisfy the highly
          limited metabolic demands of the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci trpoperon originate by lateral
          gene transfer?
          The tryptophan operon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci is probably derived
          from ancestral chlamydial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> before modern events of
          gene reduction occurred. However, as the present-day 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci operon is unique among
          chlamydiae, it is also possible that 
          trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were lost and then
          reacquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer (LGT). As this would
          have happened recently (after divergence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci from other chlamydial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>), one might then expect the genes to have GC
          contents different from that of the overall 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci genome (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>). Table
          1shows that each operon gene, as well as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> and 
          trpEb-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, are within the range
          expected for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci. However, the GC
          content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor genome</ENAMEX> could have fortuitously been
          near that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci. If so, one might
          expect that the top hits returned from a BLAST search of
          each 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci operon gene would not
          include other chlamydial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and would be dominated by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> having an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. The
          results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) show that this expectation was not
          realized.
          It is perhaps intriguing that when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci kynureninase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KynU</ENAMEX>) was
          used as a query sequence, the top hits returned from
          BLAST were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KynU</ENAMEX> orthologs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
          Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KynU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> (left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) was compared with the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">respective organisms</ENAMEX> (right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The codon
          usage for arginine, leucine, proline and valine is
          distinctive in a comparison of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX>. The profile of codon
          usage for these amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. psittaci KynU</ENAMEX> clearly matches
          the genomic codon-usage profile of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, but not that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX>. Thus, there is no
          evidence for a recent LGT of 
          kynU between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX>. 
        
        
          Deterioration of tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
          chlamydiae
          Chlamydial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have generally undergone reductive
          evolution that includes an inability to synthesize
          tryptophan from chorismate. That the process of reductive
          evolution is ongoing is suggested by the variability of
          remaining remnants and by indications that some of these
          remnants are pseudogenes. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> extreme, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae has lost all
          tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> remnant (
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpC</ENAMEX> ); and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> remnants (
          
          trpC, trpEa and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb</ENAMEX> ). It appears that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci alone assigns a
          functional role to tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, but it is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kynurenine</ENAMEX>-to-tryptophan pathway rather than a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chorismate</ENAMEX>-to-tryptophan pathway. Thus, even 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci is dependent upon host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> (that is, kynurenine) for tryptophan.
          Figure 4shows a sequence comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpC</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> with those from chlamydial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> can be assessed with guidance
          from X-ray crystallography data (see legend) and
          invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> seen in multiple alignments. Given the
          presumed lack of selection for function in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum, it would not be
          surprising to find evidence of unfavorable mutations.
          Indeed, the mutations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H335 → S335</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli numbering</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G385 →</ENAMEX> E385
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum, but not in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, probably reflect
          unfavorable catalytic alterations (see heavy up arrows in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> changes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, not present in the

          T429) are conservative changes that are presumably
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerated</ENAMEX>.
          TrpEa from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis has clearly
          accumulated deleterious mutations in contrast to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. psittaci TrpEa</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Comparison of these sequences with that of the well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">studied TrpEa</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> typhimurium shows 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. trachomatis TrpEa</ENAMEX> (but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. psittaci TrpEa</ENAMEX>) to have the
          following changes at critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium numbering): <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G61</NUMEX> →
          N61, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G211 → R211</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/L212 → R212</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G234 → K234</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, the intersubunit signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue G181</ENAMEX> has
          been changed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A181</NUMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trachomatis TrpEa</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-residue deletion between
          R192 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K193</ENAMEX> that is unique in our comprehensive
          alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX>. Xie 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] pointed out that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. trachomatis TrpEa</ENAMEX>, but not of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. psittaci TrpEa</ENAMEX>, on an unrooted
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpEa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was consistent with
          a likely pseudogene status for the former. The rapid
          deterioration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> is, in fact, apparent from
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEa</ENAMEX> from various serovars of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trachomatis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Thus, serovar
          B lacks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> altogether, serovars A and C express
          severely truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpEa proteins</ENAMEX>, whereas serovars <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and
          L2 express full-length TrpEa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (although
          undoubtedly inactive).
          The β subunits of tryptophan synthase in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trachomatis</ENAMEX> appear to have all
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues conserved</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This includes
          conserved catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are
          important for establishing intersubunit and intrasubunit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> needed for formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">α-β complex</ENAMEX> of
          tryptophan synthase. It appears that there has been rapid
          deterioration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX>, but not of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX>. This might
          suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> is under positive selection for some
          functional role other than that of tryptophan synthase.
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpEb</ENAMEX> is not complexed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX>, it has
          substantial activity as serine deaminase. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">present-day TrpEb</ENAMEX> may function in the chlamydiae as
          serine deaminase, as has been proposed by Xie 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] for some archaea. This
          is consistent with the total absence of genes in
          chlamydiae known to encode enzymes with serine deaminase
          activity. These enzymes include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>-S serine deaminase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GenBank gi 2501150</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX>-dependent serine deaminase (gi

          biosynthetic threonine deaminase (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi 135720</ENAMEX>).
          A very recent paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fehlner-Gardiner</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] affirms experimentally
          the predictions made in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> should be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> should not be functional.
          Fehlner-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardiner</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequenced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpEa</ENAMEX> and
          TrpEb from all human serovars of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis. All of the genital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serovars</ENAMEX> expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrpEb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> had catalytic activity. Interestingly, the
          catalytic indole-utilizing activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> required a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">full-length TrpEa</ENAMEX>. It appears that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpEa proteins</ENAMEX>,
          although lacking their own catalytic activity, are still
          functional in maintaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> activity. Even though
          most of the ocular serovars also had a potentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional TrpEb</ENAMEX>, none of them would presumably utilize
          indole 
          in vivo because of the absence of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">full-length TrpEa</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> propose that other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in the microenvironment of genital serovars
          might be a source of indole, a situation not expected in
          the microenvironment of ocular serovars. In short, the
          tissue tropism correlates with ability to convert indole
          to L-tryptophan 
          in vivo. This seems a reasonable
          possibility, although it does not explain why most of the
          ocular serovars have maintained a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> that seems to
          have resisted reductive evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. It would be
          interesting to know whether the serine deaminase activity
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. trachomatis TrpEb</ENAMEX> (an activity
          other than indole utilization suggested in this paper)
          requires full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpEa</ENAMEX> or not.
        
        
          Overview of tryptophan-pathway variability in
          chlamydiae
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] have correlated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the number of tryptophan-pathway enzymes
          present in chlamydiae (in particular, the α subunit of
          tryptophan synthase) with varied sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ
          treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] and ease of demonstrating the transition
          to persistence 
          in vitro. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis A, B and C
          readily develop persistent characteristics following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ treatment. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae also is readily
          converted to persistence with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tryptophan</ENAMEX> has been reported to be essential for growth
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serovars A</ENAMEX>, B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, but not for growth of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci or serovars <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-K and L2
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trachomatis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. Thus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis serovars A-C, but
          not serovars <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-K or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-L3</ENAMEX>, have been described as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'tryptophan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auxotrophs</ENAMEX>' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Likewise, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae, but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, has been described as
          a tryptophan auxotroph. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] has also discussed
          the possible relationship of genes present or absent for
          tryptophan biosynthesis and the differential
          sensitivities of chlamydiae to inhibitory effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] imply that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci are competent for
          tryptophan biosynthesis, unlike 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis A, B, C and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae. This correlates
          nicely with proneness to persistence and the more
          demonstrable nutritional requirement for tryptophan in
          the latter strains, but not the former. However, from the
          current database information available, it appears likely
          that all chlamydiae, even 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, are tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">auxotrophs</ENAMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> itself is incapable of tryptophan
          biosynthesis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is not a credible source of any
          biosynthetic intermediates. It is also noteworthy that
          only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci has PRPP synthase,
          which is needed for provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRPP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpB</ENAMEX> step). Thus,
          there seems to be no basis for the conclusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] that
          variations in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis serovar pathogenesis
          can be directly linked to differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEa</ENAMEX>, and it
          therefore seems that the latter differences are
          coincidental. Differential capabilities for acquisition
          of the host resources are unknown variables that might
          distinguish different strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. In this context, it
          seems possible that variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LifA</ENAMEX> integrity or copy
          number could easily explain variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and the nutritional requirement for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan 
          in vitro. 
          Except for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, we may be seeing
          different strains in varied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of reductive evolution
          with respect to what remnants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> remain. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis B lack genes
          encoding the entire tryptophan pathway. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> possesses 
          trpC, trpEa and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb; C. muridarum</ENAMEX> possesses only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpC; C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis A and C
          possess 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb</ENAMEX>. The truncation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, the likely
          pseudogene status of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">serovar</TIMEX> D, and the absence
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">trpEa</ENAMEX> altogether in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">serovar</TIMEX> B
          indicates an active ongoing process of reductive
          evolution.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydial</ENAMEX> transport of tryptophan, kynurenine and
          serine
          The chlamydiae are dependent on host cells for a
          variety of metabolites that are relevant to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host-parasite</ENAMEX> relationships of tryptophan metabolism.
          These include kynurenine, serine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and tryptophan
          itself. Hence, the nature and variability for transport
          of these compounds should be of considerable
          interest.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chlamydiae</ENAMEX> possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (

          unrooted radial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that shows the chlamydial proteins
          to comprise a distinct cluster. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli Mtr</ENAMEX> (high-affinity
          tryptophan permease) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TnaB</ENAMEX> (low-affinity tryptophan

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equidistant from the TyrP/Mtr-TnaB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groupings</ENAMEX>. These chlamydial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might be
          broad-specificity transporters of tryptophan, tyrosine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX> and perhaps kynurenine as well.
          When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na +-coupled serine symporter SdaC</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> was used as a query against
          the chlamydial genomes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TyrP</ENAMEX> was the top hit (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>

          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAAAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. An alternative query, the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transporter</ENAMEX>, yielded CT216 as the top hit (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 22%</NUMEX>
          identity). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> possesses a Na +-coupled
          serine symporter, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SttT</ENAMEX>, which is regulated by tryptophan
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. Although this is but one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX>
          different transporters for serine in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, sstT encodes the sole

          were judged to be the most likely genes encoding serine

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SstT proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The tryptophan repressor
          The presence of 
          trpR implies that the tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operon</ENAMEX> is under repression control by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan, and
          some experimental evidence does indeed show derepression
          under conditions of tryptophan limitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
          Starvation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-derived L-tryptophan, which is
          initiated by induction of indoleamine dioxygenase by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ, undoubtedly triggers derepression of the entire
          tryptophan operon, including the genes encoding PRPP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> and kynureninase. Kynureninase from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci is a key linker between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">anthranilate-utilizing TrpB</ENAMEX> enzyme that initiates
          tryptophan biosynthesis in the parasite and the host
          kynurenine foramidase that generates kynurenine. In
          effect a hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-parasite cycle is generated in which
          a metabolic stream in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> away from tryptophan is
          intercepted by a metabolic stream toward tryptophan in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci. 
          The thoroughly studied repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
          regulates tryptophan biosynthesis in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> is of limited phylogenetic
          distribution. In fact, 
          Xylella fastidiosa, C.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trachomatis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci are the only organisms
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage known to possess 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of 
          trpR was examined for evidence of
          possible horizontal transfer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3lists</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
          of 
          trpR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, compared to the GC
          content of the corresponding genomes. The 
          trpR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of each organism
          corresponded relatively well to the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content,
          except for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa where 
          trpR exhibited a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content,
          more similar to that of the chlamydiae or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae. 
        
        
          Does C. psittacihave a regulon controlled by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX>?
          In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> the 
          trp repressor binds upstream of the
          
          trp operon and upstream at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mtr</ENAMEX> transport gene in promoter
          regions where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTCG</ENAMEX> or CTAG are important for binding [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>]. The 
          sstT gene of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> is also subject to
          repression control by tryptophan and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTCG</ENAMEX> upstream
          region has been proposed to be an additional target
          region for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
          As 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci has 
          trpR, it seems quite possible that
          the 
          trp operon, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sstT</ENAMEX> (for serine transport), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrP</ENAMEX> (for tryptophan transport)
          might comprise a regulon controlled by the 
          trpR repressor. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTAG</ENAMEX> and/or
          CTCG motifs were found upstream of all these genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci, but the presence of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> did not exceed random probability
          sufficiently to justify any concrete assertions. The
          further use of a computational approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] to identify
          the transcription regulatory pattern was also not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating</ENAMEX>. As chlamydial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpR proteins</ENAMEX> are the most
          divergent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpR proteins</ENAMEX>, the motif pattern for DNA
          binding may also be divergent.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Chlamydial parasites appear to respond to host
        mechanisms for restriction of tryptophan availability with
        a diversity of strategies, the exact nature of which we
        still know very little. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strategy utilized by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">muridarum</ENAMEX> employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a three</NUMEX>-copy
        dose of 
        lifA, which could inhibit cytokine
        proliferation and decrease <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> production by the host
        (although at least some IFN-γ has been shown to be produced
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> infected with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muridarum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]). Such a strategy
        would seem to be consistent with acute infections, which
        can be a successful mode of pathogenicity in some
        situations, such as high-density rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. In the
        case of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum, the mechanism does not
        necessarily involve blocking the induction of indoleamine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dioxygenase</ENAMEX> and thereby preventing depletion of host
        tryptophan, in view of some experimental work with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MoPn/</ENAMEX>mouse model system. The primary effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ
        may not be to cause starvation for tryptophan as
        anti-chlamydial and anti-proliferative activities of murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was not reversible by tryptophan [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>]. It has been concluded in other studies as well [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>] that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion is not an
        important factor in the MoPn/mouse model system. However, a
        conflicting conclusion was recently published by Perfettini
        
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] that the inhibitory
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ in mouse cell cultures and genital tracts
        seems to be due in part to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion (because
        inhibition was partially reversed by tryptophan). It has
        been generally observed that in murine systems indoleamine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dioxygenase</ENAMEX> has not been induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ under the same
        experimental conditions that readily induce synthesis of
        the enzyme in human systems. However, the potential to
        induce the dioxygenase in murine systems by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ exposure
        has been demonstrated when nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> production is
        blocked [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Thus, it seems that the key difference
        between the mouse and human systems might lie in the
        details that dictate the balance between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-regulated pathways of tryptophan and arginine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). If so, in human systems the
        balance favors domination by the indoleamine dioxygenase
        route, whereas in murine systems the nitric oxide route is
        favored. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> factors could influence the
        balance, including differential sensitivities of NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> to inhibition by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-hydroxyanthranilate or</NUMEX> of
        indoleamine dioxygenase to inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokine-mediated</ENAMEX> mechanisms
        undoubtedly await elucidation.
        In any event, for most chlamydiae the successful
        implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is
        closely tied to chlamydial responses that result in a
        persistent metabolic state and chronic disease. It would
        appear that chlamydiae have learned to recognize and
        exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion as an environmental cue that
        initiates a distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of remodeling biochemistry that
        promotes long-term viability in a latent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        It is difficult to guess whether the ability of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci to scavenge kynurenine as
        a source of tryptophan is a recent innovation in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX>, or whether it represents an ancient chlamydial
        strategy that has been abandoned by other chlamydiae.
        Perhaps the strategy is linked to the particular tissue
        tropism of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci. Because the presence of
        the tryptophan-pathway enzymes varies so markedly, even
        between closely related stains, one cannot be certain at
        this point that the tryptophan-recapture cycle is uniquely
        characteristic of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci. It cannot be ruled out
        that other strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> psittaci might lack the cycle,
        whereas some strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae not yet sequenced might
        possess it. Different overall host metabolism and different
        biochemical environments in various tissues undoubtedly
        influence the availability of kynurenine (as well as other
        metabolites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and serine). Hence, tissue tropism
        must be a crucial factor. It would be interesting to know
        whether the tryptophan-recapture cycle is capable of
        providing abundant tryptophan to the parasite, or whether
        it might be more subtly geared to provision of barely
        adequate tryptophan for parasites established in the
        chronic-infection mode.
