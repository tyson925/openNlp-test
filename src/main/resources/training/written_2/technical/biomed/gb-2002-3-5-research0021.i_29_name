        Conditional gene expression systems such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
        regulated by tetracycline or doxycycline (DOX) have several
        advantages for testing the effects of genes on aging and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. In the 'tet-on' system, feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> to
        
        Drosophila melanogaster causes high
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression in all tissues. By waiting
        until the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> stage to administer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, all of
        pre-adult development is identical between control and
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and any difference in lifespan must be
        due to changes in the adult. Subtle differences in the
        genetic background of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> can have
        significant effects on lifespan [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. With the tet-on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, control and experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have identical
        genetic backgrounds, and therefore any differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> must be due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> itself, and overexpression of control genes
        such as 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli lacZ</ENAMEX>, have no
        detectable effects on lifespan [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, several
        genes have been identified for which DOX-regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> has negative effects on lifespan, and
        overexpression of the 
        dGMII gene, encoding Î±-mannosidase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, was associated with slightly increased lifespan [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>].
        Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> has long been known to be
        able to inhibit gene expression in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. Double-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (dsRNA) formed by
        hybridization of sense and antisense sequences is thought
        to initiate a pathway in which homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> are
        destroyed. This phenomenon has been referred to as post
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene silencing</ENAMEX> (PTGS) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>). Expression of inverted-repeat constructs, where the
        transcript is expected to fold into a dsRNA hairpin, has
        been shown to be an efficient initiator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. In experiments reported here, the tet-on system was
        used to drive expression of inverted-repeat constructs in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> to determine if a
        conditional system for RNAi could be created.
        In natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, lifespan and reproductive period
        are thought to co-evolve [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The duration of the
        reproductive period is subject to natural selection, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> is altered as a consequence. Significant
        experimental support for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has come from
        laboratory selection experiments with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. Genetically heterogeneous 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have been
        selected over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> for late-life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>. Such selection results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> with
        increased lifespan relative to controls. Selection is
        thought to function by altering the frequency of gene
        alleles present in the starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Selected
        strains exhibit a number of correlated phenotypes. The
        correlated phenotypes can vary somewhat depending on the
        starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used; however, increased stress-resistance
        appears to be common to all or most long-lived strains [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. In one well studied set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        replicate control (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) and long-lived (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) strains, lifespan
        was doubled and was correlated with increased
        stress-resistance and increased glycogen and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starch-gel electrophoresis</ENAMEX> has been used to assay for
        changes in the frequency of enzyme electrophoretic alleles
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and B lines. A change in the frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/Zn</ENAMEX>-superoxide dismutase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/ZnSOD</ENAMEX>) alleles was observed,
        with the more active allele enriched in the long-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Consistent with this observation,
        overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/ZnSOD</ENAMEX> in transgenic 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        sufficient to cause significant increases in lifespan [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. The most dramatic change in allele frequency in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        and B lines was observed for the gene for 
        phosphogluconate mutase ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. 
        Pgm exists in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> electrophoretic
        forms: fast ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pgm F</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm M</ENAMEX>) and slow ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm S</ENAMEX>). 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Mpredominates</ENAMEX> in the B strains,
        whereas 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> frequency is on average
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold higher in the long-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> strains relative to the
        B controls. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> strains were taken off selection for
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> (back-selection), lifespan decreased
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> frequency was reduced to
        levels more like those in B strains. These results suggest
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> or a closely linked gene is
        responding to selection, and make 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> lifespan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> encodes the enzyme
        phosphoglucomutase, which inter-converts glucose
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate</TIMEX>. Its activity is
        therefore important for both glycolysis and glycogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, and the altered 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele frequency might therefore
        be relevant to the increased glycogen and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">O strains</ENAMEX>. If the increased 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> frequency is contributing
        to the unique phenotypes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">long-lived O strains</ENAMEX>, this
        might be because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Shas</ENAMEX> increased or decreased
        enzyme activity, or enzyme activity has been altered in
        some way (perhaps by a change in its regulation). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way
        to begin to test these models experimentally is to engineer
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> with increased or decreased 
        Pgm expression and assay for effects
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lifespan</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Multiple strains</ENAMEX> were generated that were homozygous for
        each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and S electrophoretic alleles of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX>, by appropriate crosses to a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> chromosome balancer stock. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> enzyme activity and lifespan
        varied greatly across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> with no correlation with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele (data not shown). This
        result was expected, as differences in genetic background
        between such purified chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> has profound
        effects on lifespan and the activities of various enzymes [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 33</ENAMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> coding-region sequences were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX> and sequenced from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pgm F</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Mand</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Shomozygous</ENAMEX> strains and from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton-S</ENAMEX> wild-type strain. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> were
        identified that predicted pI values for the alleles that
        correlated with their mobility on starch gels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> for A in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Screates</ENAMEX> the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTK</ENAMEX> (in the single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> code) which is a
        potential phosphorylation site for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (PKC)
        that is absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Mand</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm F.</ENAMEX>
        If 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Scontributes</ENAMEX> to the increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> lines, this might be due to increased
        enzyme activity, decreased enzyme activity, or alteration
        in enzyme activity in some other way such as in its
        regulation or subcellular localization. The tet-on system
        was used to test whether simply increasing or decreasing 
        Pgm expression would be sufficient to
        alter lifespan. A P-element transformation vector called
        USC1.0 was generated, which had unique 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> and 
        Pst I sites downstream of the tet-on
        doxycycline-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). USC1.0 also
        contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX> 
        white +transformation marker gene.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm ScDNA</ENAMEX> sequences were cloned into
        USC1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0</NUMEX> to create the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMsense</ENAMEX> construct (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), which
        should allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM Senzyme</ENAMEX>. A fragment
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Scoding</ENAMEX> region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kilobase</ENAMEX> (kb) (from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">+711 to +1,794</NUMEX>) was cloned into USC1.0
        in an inverted-repeat orientation to create construct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMinvrpt</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>), which should potentially cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conditional RNAi</ENAMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> construct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> independent
        transgenic lines were generated using standard methods. As
        a control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trangenic lines were generated containing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USC1.0</ENAMEX> vector in which no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is expressed.
        Expression of the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">constructs</ENAMEX> and the
        endogenous 
        Pgm gene was assayed by northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX>, with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). The 
        Pgm inverted-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were
        used as probes and should hybridize to both transgenes and
        the endogenous 
        Pgm transcript. In the
        sense-construct lines, feeding DOX resulted in efficient
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> at levels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five- to ten</NUMEX>-fold
        greater than the endogenous transcript. DOX-induced
        expression of the inverted-repeat construct had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effects
        detected by northern blot. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> produced a smear of
        hybridization resulting from the inverted-repeat transcript
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). The smear pattern may have resulted from
        incomplete denaturation of the hairpin structure and/or
        instability of the inverted-repeat transcript. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
        level of the endogenous 
        Pgm transcript was found to be
        reduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> feeding.
        The northern blots were also hybridized with a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> -specific probe corresponding to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> coding-region sequences (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+700</ENAMEX>) located outside the region used to create the
        inverted repeat. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is therefore specific for the
        endogenous 
        Pgm transcript. Using this probe the
        smear of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> derived from the inverted-repeat
        construct was no longer detected, and the endogenous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pgm RNA</ENAMEX> levels were more readily
        observed and quantitated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). DOX induced
        expression of the inverted-repeat construct was found to
        cause a reduction of endogenous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pgm RNA</ENAMEX> levels. The decrease varied
        across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> transgenic lines, with reductions ranging
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3- to 24-fold</NUMEX>. The inverted-repeat construct
        therefore appears to function as expected to induce RNAi
        and cause decreased expression of the endogenous 
        Pgm gene. In the control strains
        where no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is expressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was
        found to have no effect on 
        Pgm transcript levels (Figure
        3c).
        The indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity assay was used to assay for
        changes in 
        Pgm gene expression at the protein
        level. The sense construct yielded conditional
        overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity in each transgenic line,
        with increases ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Potential reductions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity were more difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> because of the inherent limitations of the assay. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity assay is indirect and is coupled to the
        conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX>. The extract will contain
        other activities capable of converting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX>,
        thereby creating a significant background activity.
        Decreases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity could not be reliably measured
        because of this unavoidable background. The PGMinvrpt
        construct yielded decreases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> activity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>; however, the effect was quite variable from experiment
        to experiment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In the control strains where no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> is expressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was found to
        have no consistent effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        To determine whether altered 
        Pgm gene expression could affect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>, mean lifespan was assayed in multiple PGMsense
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMinvrpt</ENAMEX> transgenic lines with or without DOX
        treatment. The percentage change in mean lifespan caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene expression</ENAMEX> is presented for each line.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifespan</ENAMEX> was observed to vary across transgenic lines and
        replicate experiments with changes ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7% to +6%</NUMEX>,
        with one outlier at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">+16%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). However, no change in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> was observed that was consistent across the sense
        or inverted-repeat lines or in multiple experiments. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> assays were repeated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29Â°C</TIMEX>, and again no
        consistent changes were observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). We conclude
        that under these conditions, altered 
        Pgm expression does not have a
        detectable effect on adult 
        Drosophila lifespan.
      
      
        Discussion
        The phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> (or PTGS) is of great interest
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. First, it represents an
        evolutionarily conserved pathway that probably has
        important functions in the regulation of gene expression
        and the control of transposable elements. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it
        provides a means for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to test gene functions by
        experimentally downregulating expression of specific genes
        under well controlled conditions. In 
        Drosophila, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> can be initiated by
        injection of dsRNA into embryos, and this has allowed
        identification of novel phenotypes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> during
        development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. However, injection has limited potential
        application in the adult, as it is unlikely that the RNAi
        could be targeted to all tissues, or to specific tissues,
        and the trauma of injection is likely to have negative
        effects on phenotypes such as lifespan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transgenic</ENAMEX>
        constructs have been used to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNAi</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila, by using various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to drive expression of inverted-repeat fragments
        of gene coding regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Using the conditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tet</ENAMEX>-on promoter system to drive expression of an
        inverted-repeat provided conditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> of the 
        Pgm gene. This conditional system
        should have many applications, both in the study of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> pathway itself and in the design of experiments where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> is used a research tool. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conditional RNAi</ENAMEX> should be
        particularly useful to study phenotypes in the adult such
        as aging and lifespan. Conditional gene-expression systems
        have previously been used to identify positive regulators
        of lifespan, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/ZnSOD</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dGMII</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 31</ENAMEX>]. In addition,
        mutations have been used to identify several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila that act as negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lifespan</ENAMEX>, such as 
        mth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INDY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chico</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. For 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mth</ENAMEX> and 
        InR the null phenotype of the genes
        is lethality. Therefore it is only rare hypomorphic alleles
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">allele</ENAMEX> combinations that allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to survive to
        adult stage where increased lifespan can be observed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conditional RNAi</ENAMEX> should provide a powerful means to study
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and other negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of aging and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>. Inactivation or downregulation of the genes
        specifically in the adult using tet-on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> may allow
        increased lifespan without confounding effects on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thummel</ENAMEX> have recently reported the use
        of a heat-shock gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> to drive expression of dsRNA,
        and the efficient conditional inhibition of gene expression
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">larval</TIMEX> and pupal stages of 
        Drosophila development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        Genetic selection of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for late-life
        reproduction caused the correlated phenotype of increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> and increased the frequency of the slow
        electrophoretic allele, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm S</ENAMEX>, of the 
        Pgm gene. If 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Scontributes</ENAMEX> to the increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> phenotype of the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, it might be
        because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Shas</ENAMEX> increased activity,
        decreased activity or activity that is altered in some way
        such as through its regulation or subcellular localization.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> alleles were cloned and sequenced
        and were found to differ by amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> substitutions
        consistent with the relative electrophoretic mobilities of
        the encoded enzymes.
        A recent study reported the sequencing of several fast,
        medium and slow electrophoretic alleles of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> from a wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. The sequences
        reported in that study (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Verrelli alleles</NUMEX>) are comparable to
        those reported here (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ives alleles</NUMEX>) as follows: the medium
        Verrelli allele used for alignment is identical in
        amino-acid sequence to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> medium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>. The Verrelli
        fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> fast allele in each
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> positions at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> fast
        differs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> medium (wild-type) allele. There are
        a number of differences between the Verrelli slow alleles
        and the Ives slow allele. The Verrelli slow alleles are not
        all identical to each other. The Ives slow allele differs
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> medium (wild-type) amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        positions (amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> positions 6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E â G</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A â T</ENAMEX>)).
        The amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> change in the Ives slow allele at position 6
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E â G</ENAMEX>) is not reflected in any of the Verrelli slow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> change in the Ives slow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> (at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) is shared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the Verrelli
        slow alleles. In addition, the Verrelli slow alleles have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammo-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> that are not shared by the Ives
        slow allele. The data are consistent with the conclusion
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> is highly polymorphic and subject
        to selection in natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. Consistent
        with this idea, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> haplotypes and glycogen content
        have been found to vary among flies at different latitudes
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
        The tet-on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter system</ENAMEX> allowed a test of the
        hypothesis that increasing or decreasing 
        Pgm gene expression would affect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> enzyme levels were increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-fold using a sense transgenic construct, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pgm RNA</ENAMEX> levels were decreased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>- to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-fold</NUMEX> by driving expression of an inverted-repeat
        construct. No changes in lifespan were detected that were
        consistent across multiple transgenic lines or replicate
        experiments. The results indicate that simply increasing or
        decreasing 
        Pgm gene expression does not
        significantly affect the lifespan of adult 
        Drosophila, at least under the
        conditions tested.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> used in these experiments
        was cloned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> strain, which is the progenitor of
        the long-lived selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> and their controls. The
        high degree of polymorphism of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> makes it possible that the slow
        electrophoretic allele in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> strain could consist of
        multiple DNA sequence forms. The failure to observe effects
        on lifespan could therefore conceivably have resulted from
        overexpression of the wrong DNA sequence form of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm S. However</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Swas</ENAMEX> cloned and sequenced from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent lines derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> strain and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> had the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>. The data therefore
        suggest that most, if not all, of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Salleles</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> have
        the same sequence, making sequence heterogeneity an
        unlikely explanation of the present results.
        The results suggest several possibilities for the
        relationship of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele frequency to the increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> of the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Smight</ENAMEX> in fact contribute to the
        increased lifespan of the selected strains as a result of
        an increased or decreased activity, but that the effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> is too small to be detected in these assays. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> assay appears to have a variability with control
        strains of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-5% to +5%</NUMEX>, as seen in the data
        presented here and elsewhere (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.L.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Bhole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.T.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished results). It is therefore unlikely that an
        effect much smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> could be identified. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele frequencies are altered
        because of selection for an unknown linked gene, and this
        possibility cannot be ruled out at this time. The
        experiments presented here suggest that tet-on regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> of genes near 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> may be a promising approach.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Scontributes</ENAMEX> to increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> of the selected strains because of an alteration
        in its regulation and/or subcellular localization. The
        sequence analysis of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> alleles reveals a novel potential
        site in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sfor</ENAMEX> phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX>;
        however, the potential significance of this change is
        unknown. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> was used for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> experiments presented here, and presumably
        the overexpressed enzyme should be subject to any
        regulation or localization characteristic of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm S. However</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Senzyme</ENAMEX> was overexpressed in a
        'wild-type' 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Mbackground</ENAMEX>, and it may be that
        any phenotypic consequences of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX> function are not apparent
        when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Mis</ENAMEX> also present. Finally,
        another possible explanation for the absence of an effect
        on longevity is the method of assay. The selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> stocks
        were handled and assayed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> together,
        repeatedly mating during adult life. The present assay used
        segregated sexes, which is a different environment. This
        was done because the segregated-sexes assay is sensitive to
        even small changes in lifespan, and has been used
        successfully in the past to detect the effects of other
        genes on lifespan. It is possible that an effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX> might be identified with different lifespan assay
        conditions. However, even if this explanation were to be
        true, the data still indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGM</ENAMEX> does not have a
        simple strong effect on longevity. Further experiments will
        be required to distinguish between these interesting
        possibilities for the link between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele frequency and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophilastocks</ENAMEX> and culture
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX> transgenic 
          Drosophila stocks were generated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-element germline transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], using a modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microinjection</ENAMEX> technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Transgenic lines are
          named as the construct, followed by the chromosome of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> in parentheses, followed by a unique line
          designation. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMinvrpt</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> is PGMinvrpt
          construct inserted on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX>. Cytological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of insertion were
          not determined. Multiple strains homozygous for each of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Mand</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Salleles</ENAMEX> were generated by
          purifying <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> chromosomes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ives</ENAMEX> stock, which is
          the precursor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and B selection stocks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          Homozygosity for a particular 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> allele was confirmed by
          starch-gel electrophoresis assay, as previously described
          ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and data not shown). Other 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are as described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. All stocks were grown on standard cornmeal-agar
          medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] and were cultured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifespan</ENAMEX> assays
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Strains homozygous</ENAMEX> for the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">constructs</ENAMEX> were
          crossed to rtTA(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)E2 strain, homozygous for the rtTA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transactivator</ENAMEX> construct, to generate progeny
          heterozygous for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> flies were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E2/+</ENAMEX>, that is, lacking a target construct. To
          obtain adult flies of defined age, the crosses were
          cultured at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25Â°C</NUMEX> in urine specimen bottles. Before
          eclosion of the majority of pupae, bottles were cleared
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and newly eclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> were allowed to emerge
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 48</TIMEX> h. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> will have mated
          during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> only were then removed and
          were designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day old</TIMEX>, and were maintained at 25Â°C
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> per vial in culture vials with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and passaged
          to new vials every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> h. For certain experiments the
          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29Â°C</TIMEX>, as indicated. For
          certain experiments, female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> were used, as
          indicated. Those flies being fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> were kept on food

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing reactions were done using the

          assays
          The activity assay was carried out essentially as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> male flies were
          anesthetized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>

          using a motorized mortar and pestle. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼l
          Tris buffer was added for a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The

          again and placed in a spectrophotometer. To insure that
          readings were being taken in the linear range of the
          enzyme activity, standard curves were generated with
          respect to both time and amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> added.
          Readings were taken at

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> and were expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ÎOD/Î¼g/min.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein concentrations</ENAMEX> were determined using the BioRad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein concentration solution</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> as standard. All
          extracts were assayed in triplicate, and the averages and
          standard deviations are presented. Means were compared
          using unpaired, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-side 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values are presented. The enzyme
          assay measures the conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX> rather
          than a direct measure of phosphoglucomutase itself. In
          other words, it is measuring a secondary, coupled
          reaction.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> constructs
          All inserts for microinjection were cloned into a
          derivative of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7T40</NUMEX> construct [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USC1.0</ENAMEX>.
          USC1.0 was generated as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7T40</TIMEX> was digested
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX>, thus liberating the Hsp70
          polyadenylation signal sequence. The construct was then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religated</ENAMEX> and transformed. Next, the 
          Pst I site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">polylinker 1</TIMEX> was
          destroyed by partial 
          Pst I digestion followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T4</TIMEX> DNA
          polymerase fill-in and ligation. Clones were screened for
          destruction of the correct 
          Pst I site to generate USC1.0
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). All inserts were cloned into the unique 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">USC1.0</NUMEX>.
          The 
          Pgm sense construct was made as
          follows. The reverse transcription was carried out on
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from a strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies homozygous</ENAMEX> for
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm Sallele</ENAMEX>, using the following
          primer: dTB 
          I B

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAACCCGGGTCTACAAAGTGATACTGCGTAACTGACTATATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3</ENAMEX>'.
          A nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> strategy was then used to amplify the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm ScDNA</ENAMEX> using the following
          primers: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> primer set: B 
          I : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAACCCGGGTCTACAAAGTG-3</ENAMEX>'.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was cloned into the 
          Eco <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> site of pBluescript <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KS</ENAMEX>+ and
          clones were screened for the correct orientation. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pgm ScDNA</ENAMEX> was then liberated by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco</ENAMEX> RI complete digest followed by 
          Pst I partial digest and cloned
          into the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> to 
          Pst I sites of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">USC1.0</NUMEX> to generate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">construct PGMsense</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMinvrpt</ENAMEX> construct was made as follows: because
          the final insert would be a large inverted repeat, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm Swas</ENAMEX> PCR-amplified in two
          pieces, in opposite orientations. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of primers
          used for the amplifications were: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> set: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pgm</ENAMEX> -sense (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>') (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,773 to +1,794</NUMEX>):
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AGCTGAATTCCACAAACTTTAATAAATCCGAAAC-3</ENAMEX>'.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AGCTCTGCAGCACAAACTTTAATAAATCCGAAAC-3</ENAMEX>'. Each of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products was cloned individually into the 
          Eco <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> site of pBluescript <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KS</ENAMEX>+, and
          then restriction digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> and 
          Not I (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-set fragment) or 
          Not I and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pst I</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-set fragment). Each
          of the liberated fragments was gel purified and
          triple-ligated into the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">USC1.0</NUMEX> to generate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">construct PGMinvrpt</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Northern analyses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>) and
          the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was quantitated by UV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrophotometry</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-10 Î</TIMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> was
          resolved on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> agarose gel. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>)
          were used to determine the sizes of bands. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blotting</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was fixed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genescreen</ENAMEX> nylon membrane
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dupont</ENAMEX>) using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> crosslinker (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>). Probes were
          32P-labeled using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prime-It II</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>). To
          determine fold increases/decreases, northern blots were
          exposed onto a phosphor screen and results were analyzed
          using a phosphorimager (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImageQuaNT, Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, and all 
          Pgm northern data is normalized to 
          Rp49 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels.
