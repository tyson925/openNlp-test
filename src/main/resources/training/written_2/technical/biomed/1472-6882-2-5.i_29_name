        Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) affects up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of all pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and has a significant impact on
        the quality of life of those who experience it [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        The effects can range from mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> to more severe forms
        such as 
        hyperemesis gravidarum , which is
        characterized by an intractable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting so
        severe that it can lead to hospitalization. Although only
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 to 3%</NUMEX> of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are diagnosed with 
        hyperemesis gravidarum [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , less
        severe forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> exert a significant impact on the
        quality of life of those affected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In one study,
        close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported reduced work
        efficiency due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 25-66%</NUMEX> of women
        actually requiring time off work. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 50%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported that their NVP negatively affected their
        relationship with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> as well as having an
        adverse effect on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> life [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        There are a number of effective options available for
        the alleviation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, varying from non-pharmacological
        strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pharmacological</ENAMEX> treatments such as Diclectin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">doxylamine/pyridoxine</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihistamine H1</ENAMEX> blockers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , phenothiazines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , as well as pyroxidine
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vitamin B6</ENAMEX>) alone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 8</NUMEX> ] . The thalidomide tragedy of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bendectin ®unfounded</ENAMEX> scare of the mid
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>'s [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] has caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> to look on
        drug-based strategies with great caution due to concerns
        over the perceived teratogenicity of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 11</ENAMEX> ] ,
        even when data exist documenting safety [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Accordingly, non-pharmacological strategies to alleviate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> may be popular choices amongst pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In
        addition to dietary and lifestyle changes, the use of (CAM)
        to alleviate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> may be an attractive option for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The perceived "natural" status of herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> in
        particular and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> in general lead many to draw the
        conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> therapies are not associated with
        adverse effects.
        The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> has increased rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Estimates of the prevalence of CAM use in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 42%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, with CAM use
        particularly popular among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of reproductive age [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> surveyed reported
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.2%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Consequently, the possibility
        that pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to alleviate complaints
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> is quite possible, although the exact
        percentage remains unknown. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> therapies among
        pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is an important but little studied issue.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> prescribing patterns of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nurse-Midwives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse-midwives</ENAMEX> surveyed recommended CAM therapies to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10%</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Another study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> attending antepartum visits revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10%</NUMEX>
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported using herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplements</ENAMEX> during
        their pregnancy, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> using these
        preparations on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> basis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5%</NUMEX>
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported using other non-herbal CAM
        therapies. There are a handful of studies suggesting
        effective relief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> therapies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginger</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] , manual acupuncture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , acupressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 8</NUMEX> ] . Nevertheless, there is little research
        on the efficacy and safety of the full range of CAM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modalities</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to alleviate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        there is little information about the types of CAM
        treatments that are being used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> experiencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>,
        as well as how they obtain information about potential CAM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapies Finally</ENAMEX>, the degree of supervision of CAM use in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is not well defined.
        This pilot study was undertaken to investigate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX>, supervision and types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAM</ENAMEX> treatments used
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> counseling line at the
        Motherisk Program located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sick Children</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> receiving counseling by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motherisk Program</ENAMEX> NVP
        line, who call us from across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, were asked
        whether or not they wished to complete a phone survey
        regarding their use or non-use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to alleviate their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. The questionnaire was administered to the survey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> either directly following the counseling
        session or at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX> mutually agreed upon by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX>.
        Demographic data were collected for all of the survey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> including the number of previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
        previous experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, pregnancy-related medication
        as well as any adverse experiences related to
        pregnancy-related medication. In addition, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        were asked to describe the severity of their NVP on a scale
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-10</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> being the most severe, as well as whether
        or not they had previously used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAM</ENAMEX>. Survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> who
        reported non-use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to alleviate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> were asked to
        agree or disagree with a series of possible reasons why
        they did not use CAM to alleviate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. The level of
        agreement was measured by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Likert Scale</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> =
        strongly disagree, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = disagree somewhat, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = undecided, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        = somewhat agree and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> = strongly agree. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> who
        reported using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to alleviate their NVP were asked which
        CAM therapies they had used. They were also asked how they
        found out about CAM therapies, and whether or not their CAM
        use was supervised by a licensed health care practitioner
        who practiced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> either as part of their practice or in
        whole. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> were also asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> possible reasons why
        they chose to use CAM to alleviate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, using the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Likert Scale</ENAMEX> used for non-CAM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.
        The demographic data, reported severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, and
        previous CAM use were compared between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and non-users
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX>. The level of agreement with statements regarding
        CAM use or non-use was reported as a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likert</ENAMEX> Scale
        value plus standard deviation. Simple numerical analysis
        was used to report the types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> interventions used as
        well as the numbers and types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> consulted
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> used to access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> information.
      
      
        Results
        A total of seventy out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> consented to be
        interviewed and completed the questionnaire. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> women
        refused to participate and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> were lost to follow up. The
        demographics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> lost to follow up did not differ
        significantly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. Demographic
        characteristics of the questionnaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> are
        summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 30-34</TIMEX>. In addition, the majority were
        married (or living with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, had
        completed a college, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> or post-graduate degree and
        reported a total household income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$41,000</NUMEX> (CDN) / year
        or greater. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> were employed full-time and
        one-third identified themselves as homemakers. Most survey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> indicated that they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or less at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of interview and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> reported having
        experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting in a previous
        pregnancy.
        Half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported using pharmaceutical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> during their pregnancy, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diclectin</ENAMEX> ®being the
        most commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> (used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of those
        who indicated that they had taken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>). More than
        half of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diclectin ®users</ENAMEX> reported an adverse effect
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, namely drowsiness, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> also
        reporting irritability and dry mouth. Most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported that their family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> or
        obstetrician was their primary obstetric caregiver at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of the interview.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost two-thirds</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.2%</NUMEX>) of the survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        reported using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to alleviate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most common
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAM</ENAMEX> used are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and</ENAMEX> were: ginger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accupressure</ENAMEX> / seabands, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX>).
        The most common information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> about
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> for NVP are also summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2and
        were: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s health centres, or
        pregnancy counseling lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> followed by
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or pharmacist. The most commonly consulted CAM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> were acupuncturists, chiropractors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopaths</ENAMEX> and naturopaths. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 21.6 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        consulted with a CAM practitioner when using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleviate NVP</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.7 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> reported
        mild adverse reactions associated with using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to
        alleviate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. The most commonly reported adverse
        experiences were the intolerability of the strong flavour
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginger</ENAMEX> and wrist irritation among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> who used
        acupressure wrist bands.
        Survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were asked why they chose to use CAM
        to alleviate their NVP (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and were also asked why
        they did not use CAM (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The most common reason
        given for using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> was: because this was not really a
        "drug" and it was probably safer to use in pregnancy than a
        pharmaceutical product. The most common reason for not
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> was: there was not enough information about the
        use of these products.
        The level of education, income, severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, and
        previous CAM use were assessed as possible predictors of
        CAM use in survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. Out of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> factors
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assessed</ENAMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> severity was associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAM</ENAMEX> usage
        to alleviate NVP: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Discussion
        This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence,
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAM</ENAMEX> treatments used and supervision if any, of the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting of pregnancy by women
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> counseling line at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motherisk Program</ENAMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sick Children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.
        Because the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> has become more prevalent in the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, coupled with the fact
        that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of all pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, one might
        be able to extrapolate these results to the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, but did not call
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> helpline. It is a fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who call the NVP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helpline</ENAMEX> do have a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> status and it is known that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> status has an impact on the use CAM.(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>) However, there
        was no correlation between the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> and higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> in
        our study, the only factor that predicted the use of CAM
        was the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. This finding may appear to be
        suprising, however it was not to us at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motherisk</ENAMEX> NVP
        Helpline, because over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have told us
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX> can be so debilitating that they will try just
        about anything to alleviate their symptoms.
        Our results showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> was used by almost
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of our surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> experiencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who did not use CAM felt they would
        have if there was more information on the safety during
        pregnancy. We also found that CAM use in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
        largely unsupervised, with most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> getting information
        from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and buying the products
        directly from herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> reported
        that it made them feel more in control of their health care
        decisions and that they perceived it would be safer than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmaceutical</ENAMEX> products.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at large has probably been exposed to the
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, such as television and magazines
        as well as the internet, which is present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and may feel that because of this
        they are knowledgable about this form of medicine. Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> feel that they would like to be more in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of their own health care and perceive that CAM
        allows this, as neither a prescription nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> visit
        is required for the use of these treatments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural</ENAMEX> is often perceived as "safe" which is not
        necessarily always the case. This perception can be
        especially true with pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, who wish to protect
        their fetuses from "harmful things" such as pharmaceutical
        products. This is born out by the fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> call
        our general Motherisk Program information line asking about
        the safety of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAM</ENAMEX> use during pregnancy, as they feel
        this would be a safer option for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. The number of
        calls about the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> in general during pregnancy has
        increased dramatically over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> reflecting
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>'s interest in this form of treatment.
        Unfortunately, we have to inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> that there is
        scant research on the use and safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> during
        pregnancy, whereas there are quite a substantial number of
        studies in the current literature regarding the use and
        safety of pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> during pregnancy.
        The limitation of this study is primarily the small
        sample size, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seventy women</ENAMEX> are a low number for a survey
        of this kind. It is also not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> based study as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who call our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helpline</ENAMEX> do differ in some ways from the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, a significant amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are using CAM
        in pregnancy for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVP</ENAMEX>, despite the lack of
        safety or efficacy data and often without any supervision
        from a knowledgable practitioner. Further research in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> may allow pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> more options in treating
        this very common conditon of pregnancy.
