        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria</ENAMEX> remains an enormous public health problem in
        much of sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> was most notably associated with rural
        environments, as a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosquito</ENAMEX>'s affinity for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX>, sunlit, temporary pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, which dominate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> landscapes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . There is however,
        evidence of urban <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> transmission [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Moreover,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert et</ENAMEX> al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] identified market-garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> as
        anopheline larval sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trappe</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoulani</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] found ditches, gutters and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tyre tracks</ENAMEX> with
        anopheline larvae in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazzaville</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urbanization</ENAMEX> is changing
        the context of human-mosquito interaction and subsequent
        disease transmission in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
        Typically, urbanization is defined as fundamental
        changes in occupation and land use at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> level [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . However, in many peri-urban areas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are
        still actively engaged in rural-type activity. Although
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> migrate to urban areas to increase
        educational and economic opportunities, rural lifestyles
        persist. Deteriorating infrastructure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> access to,
        health and water and sanitation services, increasing
        population density, and widespread poverty contribute to
        conditions that modify the environment, which directly
        influences the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. These areas within and
        around urban areas are often considered "big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>" as a
        result of socio-economic, cultural, and physical conditions
        similar to contiguous rural areas. It is precisely this
        similarity that may contribute to human-mosquito contact
        and subsequent urban <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria transmission</ENAMEX>.
        Despite evidence of the potential for rapid increases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> malaria transmission [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] , vector control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programmes</ENAMEX> and mosquito-prevention programmes are still
        largely focused on rural areas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . To address the
        epidemiological consequences of human behaviour in urban
        and peri-urban areas, research must consider the scale at
        which human and mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are interacting. Such
        studies have important policy implications, since this
        information could assist policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> and public health
        practitioners prevent epidemic urban <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, and assist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in developing important information for
        populations most at risk. Moreover, results from such
        studies can help identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> doing little, or
        nothing at all, to avoid being bitten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>.
        This paper explores the interactions between mosquitoes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malindi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>.
        Descriptions of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say they are doing to avoid
        being bitten are presented. Household wealth, education
        level, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s level of planning and drainage
        were used to estimate the probability that a household
        engages in multiple mosquito-avoidance activities, or has
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> sleeping under a bednet. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of this
        paper describes the importance of understanding what people
        are doing to avoid being bitten, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> presents
        findings, and discusses policy implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
        transmission control in urban areas.
        The health belief model (HBM), which has driven so much
        of public health programming in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, is
        predicated on the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or their carers
        must <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> perceive the health issue as a problem, and then
        understand its origins and causes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBM</ENAMEX> is
        driven by the premise that behaviour change must be
        preceded by knowledge change. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX>, the use of bednets or curtains should be
        accompanied by commensurate knowledge of the pathogen
        transmission process. However, there is evidence to suggest
        that education levels and explicit knowledge of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> may not be prerequisites to the uptake of
        mosquito- or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>-prevention activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aygepong</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manderson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Accra</ENAMEX> were
        engaged in mosquito prevention regardless of whether they
        had correct knowledge about transmission. The term
        "nuisance avoidance" was used to describe this behaviour.
        Another premise that underscores many programmes is that
        increased education levels means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more
        likely to understand the transmission cycle, and that this
        factor alone can lead to behaviour change. Although health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> may be an important component, the toxic irritant
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> of the mosquito may be the only stimulus
        needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to modify their behaviour. There is
        evidence that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> employ multiple methods to
        avoid being bitten. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as decoys is a
        strategy in some pastoralist and agriculturalist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Shutters, doors, screens, or windows are commonly used as
        barriers against <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in many areas across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have reported using sisal bundles stuffed
        into cracks to keep out <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> report burning organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, such
        as dung, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Neem tree</ENAMEX>, and leaves to
        produce smoke, on the grounds that smoke repels <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have reported using
        permethrin-impregnated sisal curtains to protect themselves
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semi-nomadic Samburu</ENAMEX> herdsmen reportedly cover
        themselves in the sand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dry riverbeds</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, while
        travelling through areas where the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
        is particularly bothersome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Lochigan Pers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comm</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
        In short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have been practicing
        mosquito-avoidance long before they comprehend links
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>.
        The positive relationship between economic resources and
        high health status has often been noted in many public
        health problems. Economic resources, whether measured by
        income levels or by asset accumulation, may be proxies for
        many other pathways to improved health. This may occur
        directly as economic resources affect access to health care
        or the ability to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, or indirectly as more
        efficient use of prophylactics or prevention measures is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with higher education levels or improved
        environmental conditions. However, whether this
        relationship holds at the household level in the context of
        mosquito-avoidance and prevention behaviours has rarely
        been measured. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study of urban <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> behaviours does
        suggest that poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are less likely to be using
        protection against mosquito bites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . But this study
        used location alone as a proxy for wealth. There has been
        little work in urban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> that investigates the
        relationship between wealth and mosquito-avoidance
        behaviours as practised within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>.
        Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> desire to sleep peacefully and not be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bitten</ENAMEX>, it is worth examining factors that determine the
        use of mosquito-avoidance measures. We hypothesize that at
        the household level important factors may include house
        type, household wealth, household density, and house
        location. Safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> access, the existence of engineered
        water delivery and drainage systems, the presence or
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, and topography may also be
        important.

          comparison areas as "rural" for both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, as most of
          the livelihoods of those living in these areas were
          clearly related to agriculture.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keating et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] describe the integrated sampling
          strategy that provided the foundation for the sampling
          strategy employed in this cross-sectional study. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          the goal was to develop a random sampling scheme that
          captured both the human-ecological and biological effect
          of human-mosquito interaction in urban environments.
          Global positioning system (GPS) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were used to
          collect latitude and longitude coordinates for all major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, water-ways and significant landmarks. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX>, which were linked to existing georeferenced
          administrative data, were used to develop base-maps for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArcView</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.2 ®</NUMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographic</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information System</ENAMEX> (GIS). The sample frame was
          constructed through the overlay of a measured grid,
          consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">270 × 270 meter</NUMEX> cells, on each site. The
          study area was stratified based on the level of planning
          and drainage present within each grid cell. This resulted
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> strata for each study site: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) planned, well
          drained; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) planned, poorly drained; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) unplanned, well
          drained; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) unplanned, poorly drained, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) rural. A
          systematic random sampling strategy was then used to
          select a proportionate number of grid cells from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratum</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> grid cells were selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          grid cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>. Grid cell boundaries were located
          using compasses, base maps, and existing landmarks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
          . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1illustrates</NUMEX> the base maps for the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX> were selected from within the randomly
          selected grid cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> surveys were completed
          in each stratum for both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX> direction was
          used to approach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> from each selected grid cell.
          In strata containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 10</NUMEX> grid cells, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to be surveyed were divided equally among the
          total number of selected grid cells falling within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratum</ENAMEX>. In grid cells where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were absent or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inaccessible</ENAMEX>, questionnaires were administered to
          randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in adjacent grid cells of
          the same stratification type.
          Interviews completed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> per household
          included questions about socio-economic status,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, housing type, domestic water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, rubbish
          disposal and basic demographic information. Questions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about mosquito</NUMEX>-prevention practices and knowledge of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were also asked. These included questions
          about what methods the household used, and who slept
          under nets.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Wealth, education, housing density, and planning and
          drainage data were analysed using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis.
          Household density did not test significant as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorical</ENAMEX> or continuous variable and was not considered
          further in this analysis. The controlled effects of the
          covariates household wealth, education, and the community
          effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">strata</ENAMEX>'s underlying planning and drainage
          were tested against the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> research questions using
          logistic regression. The research questions were as
          follows: Are the proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> engaged in
          multiple mosquito-avoidance measures different among
          strata, wealth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>? If so, what
          is the effect of this difference on the probability that
          a household will engage in multiple mosquito-avoidance
          efforts? <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, are the proportions of households
          where all occupants sleep under a bednet different among
          wealth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, educational levels, and planning and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drainage</ENAMEX>? If so, is the probability that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
          household sleep under a bednet a function of these same
          factors?
          The dependent variable in model one was whether or not
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> engaged in multiple mosquito protection
          measures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX> were considered to have engaged in
          multiple mosquito protection measures if at least three
          of the following measures were reportedly used: coils,
          bednets, screening of windows and eaves, repellents,
          clearing debris from drains and ditches, burning of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">organic</ENAMEX> material, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insecticides</ENAMEX>. The dependent variable
          in model <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> was whether or not it was reported that
          everyone in the household sleeps under a bednet every
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
          Independent variables were wealth, education, and the
          area's levels of planning and drainage. A high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>,
          and low wealth index was created using factor analysis
          techniques based on reported household ownership of
          various items. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX> were considered high income if
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupant</ENAMEX> owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or satellite dish. The medium
          income group included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> owning at least a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycle</ENAMEX> or radio, and either a television, electricity,
          or telephone. Low income was defined as ownership of
          nothing listed on the questionnaire, or ownership of only
          a bicycle or radio. The education variable was created by
          assigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to low, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, or high education
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, based on the reported highest level of education
          completed by any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household member</ENAMEX>. High education was
          equal to Form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> secondary through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>.
          Medium education was equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard 7/8</ENAMEX> through Form
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Low education was equal to no education through
          Standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The planning and drainage variable was
          created by categorizing the stratification type of each
          randomly selected grid cell and assigning that value
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> falling within each respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strata</ENAMEX>.
          Logistic regression was used to determine the
          relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> using multiple
          mosquito-avoidance techniques, and wealth, education, and
          the areas level of planning and drainage. An alpha level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was chosen to indicate the significance of the
          independent variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wald</ENAMEX>'s statistics and
          log-likelihood ratios of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were used to identify
          variable significance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> fit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis was
          done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">512</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> completed a socio-economic
        questionnaire. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty seven</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.8%</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> reported all occupants using a bednet, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">277</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> reported using multiple mosquito-avoidance
        measures. The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> falling within the
        high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.3%</NUMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80.7%</NUMEX>, respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">six percent</NUMEX> of the households
        sampled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX> had access to electricity, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6%</NUMEX>
        reported owning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. The proportion of households
        occupying the high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and low education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was
        equal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35.4%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.6%</NUMEX>, respectively. The
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> sampled occupying the various planning
        and drainage strata was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately even</TIMEX>. Table 1provides
        survey summary statistics for the various strata in Kisumu
        study area. In general, the trends are in the expected
        direction. For example, the planned, well-drained stratum
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Strata 1</NUMEX>) had the highest proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> with
        access to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewer</ENAMEX> and stratum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the rural
        comparison area, had the least. The unplanned poorly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drained</ENAMEX> and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stratas</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Strata 4 and 5</NUMEX>, respectively)
        had the highest number of reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> cases, and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> planned strata (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Strata 1 and 2</NUMEX>) had the least.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> completed the questionnaire:
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> of them reported using multiple mosquito-avoidance
        measures, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> reported all occupants use
        a bednet. The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> within the high,
        medium, and low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.4%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.8%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70.8%</NUMEX>,
        respectively. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52.7%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> sampled
        reported having access to electricity, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.4%</NUMEX> reported
        car ownership. The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> within the
        high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and low-education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.9%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.9%</NUMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.2%</NUMEX>, respectively. Again, the proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> within each planning and drainage stratum was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equal. Selected summary statistics for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) show trends in the expected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in stratum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        reported using bednets, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> reported using bednets
        in the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stratum</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3lists</ENAMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> reporting various
        methods of mosquito-avoidance in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX>.
        In general, bednets and mosquito coils were the most
        reported mosquito-prevention activity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malindi</ENAMEX>, respectively reported
        burning of organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> to repel <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. In both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, bednets and coils in combination were reported more
        often than other combinations of mosquito-avoidance
        activity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.6%</NUMEX> said they did nothing to prevent
        being bitten, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.3%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> reported doing nothing. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> that reported no form of preventive action were
        from the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>, the planned well-drained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratum</ENAMEX> had the least number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> doing nothing
        and the unplanned, poorly-drained stratum and the rural
        area had the most. Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wealthiest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> reported using bednets versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 44%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> occupying the lowest wealth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>'s richest wealth group
        reported using bednets compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of the households
        occupying the lowest wealth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The questionnaire attempted to gauge whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        had correct knowledge regarding mosquito habitat and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviour</ENAMEX>. The results were varied. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.8%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> correctly reported mosquito habitat as
        stagnant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, inside dark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, or vegetation.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Seventeen percent</NUMEX> reported not knowing. When asked why
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> are sometimes found inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
        reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were either resting or
        feeding, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> reported not knowing and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> reported
        incorrect answers. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> correctly reported
        mosquito habitat as vegetation, stagnant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and inside
        dark <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> reported that they did not know. When
        asked as to why <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> are sometimes found inside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were either resting or
        hiding from the light, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> reported not knowing.
        Bivariate results reveal that the proportion of households
        engaged in multiple mosquito-prevention efforts differ for
        households occupying areas of different planning and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drainage</ENAMEX> levels (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), different wealth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), and different education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>)
        in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> with
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupants</ENAMEX> sleeping under bednets is also statistically
        different for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> among strata, among wealth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        and among the defined education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
        Results from the multivariate analysis in Kisumu
        indicate that the probability of multiple
        mosquito-avoidance efforts being used in a household is a
        function of household wealth, education, and level of
        planning and drainage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Controlling for planning
        and drainage, the wealthiest, best educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times more likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in the lowest wealth
        and education categories to adopt multiple
        mosquito-avoidance activities in the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> (OR =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.15</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.04,12.98</NUMEX>). A positive relationship exists
        between the probability of the outcome occurring and the
        level of planning and drainage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>; the
        planned well-drained, planned undrained, and unplanned
        well-drained strata are all significantly associated with
        the practice of multiple mosquito-prevention measures at
        the household level. However, caution should be used when
        interpreting this result given that it is unclear to what
        extent household wealth and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">strata</ENAMEX>'s level of
        planning/drainage are confounded. Thus, it is difficult to
        determine if this variable reflects the adult or larval
        mosquito habitat, or simply higher socio-economic
        levels.
        Results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> differed somewhat from those of
        Kisumu with respect to the practice of multiple
        mosquito-prevention measures. While the wealthiest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were significantly more likely than the poorest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to practice multiple mosquito-prevention
        measures (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.79</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.93</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.45</NUMEX>), a household's
        education level was not associated with the outcome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> testing the probability that
        everyone in a household sleeps under a bednet indicates
        that higher levels of wealth and education were associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bednet</ENAMEX> usage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). Again, the wealthiest and best
        educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as likely as the
        poorest, least educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to have reported that
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household members</ENAMEX> sleep under a bednet (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.80</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.91</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.55</NUMEX>). The level of planning and drainage also
        tested significant, suggesting that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>, community
        factors are related to mosquito control as well as
        household factors. With respect to wealth and education,
        the results were similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX>. The wealthiest and best
        educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were again more likely than the
        poorest, least educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to report bednet use (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.88</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.56,18.49</NUMEX>: see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> main findings emerge from this analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> is
        the almost ubiquitous nature of the efforts: virtually
        every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> sampled report using some form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX>. However, the data do not suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are knowledgeable about vector-borne parasite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> or necessarily acting to prevent 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> . It may be simply that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are avoiding nuisance mosquito contact. This is
        good news for international public health. Most public
        health programmes struggle to find a population-based
        impetus for raising enthusiasm. In this situation, people
        do not want to be bitten, irrespective of their knowledge
        of the transmission mechanism. Health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>, working on
        mosquito-prevention programmes, should be able to build on
        these activities.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, some of the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in our sample
        reported using some of the most expensive methods available
        on the market (i.e., they are burning coils and using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sprays</ENAMEX>). Although it is not known how frequently these
        measures are employed, the repeated purchase of coils and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sprays</ENAMEX> could be costly. Pricing of personal protection
        methods in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> suggests that a packet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> coils cost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30.00</NUMEX> (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$.38 cents</NUMEX>), and a coil is
        available singly at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KSH3.50</NUMEX> each. Aerosol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> range
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between KSH120 and 220</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$1.50 to 2.82</NUMEX>), while bednets
        cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KSH350.00 to 750.00</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$4.50 to $10.00</NUMEX>).
        Thus, while poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> may actually be spending more
        on coils or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX>, the richer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are, according to
        these results, much more likely to use bednets. As such,
        household wealth is a good predictor of whether the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of a household engage in mosquito-prevention
        activities. When a good is valued and provides a major
        public service, through protection at a population level,
        it is often considered for subsidization. Although this
        fact is not new, as evidenced by the increase in social
        marketing of bednets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , it does provide
        more evidence that even among the least educated, living in
        very degraded slums, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> if they can
        afford it. More attention is needed from the international
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> emphasizing the need to get bednets and
        other protective methods subsidized by local and national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> or by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGOs</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, in parallel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manderson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aygepong</ENAMEX>'s work in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghana</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , who found that knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> was not
        a necessary prerequisite for mosquito-avoidance behaviour,
        we also found that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> are actively trying to
        avoid being bitten, even if knowledge of how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is
        transmitted is incorrect or lacking. Despite this, the
        level of education within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kisumu</ENAMEX> households was an
        important predictor of whether the household used multiple
        methods of protection or whether everyone in the house
        slept under a net.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisumu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi</ENAMEX> are very different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, differing
        across ecology, culture, history and economics. In common,
        however, they are both rapidly growing urban centres in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> endemic areas and both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> report malaria
        transmission with varying degrees of severity throughout
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. As such, it is not surprising that both of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> areas have high proportions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> doing
        something to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. However, mosquito-avoidance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviours</ENAMEX> differ between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The higher bednet
        use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX> as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kisumu</ENAMEX>, and higher multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bednet</ENAMEX> use in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, may be a consequence of
        increased social marketing of bednets and intense
        community-based programme activity in the area in recent
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> there has been increased awareness of
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insecticide</ENAMEX> treated bednets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX> through social
        marketing strategies conducted by PopulationServices
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>, a international NGO with a country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, this awareness enabled the formation of
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community groups</ENAMEX> involved in environmental management
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> planting, drainage, and mosquito control. A
        few of these are also involved in the manufacturing and
        treating bednets for sale. Thus, knowledge of the
        advantages of bednets may have spread through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and availability (either through large
        subsidization or through free distribution) and may have
        been the partial cause of increased access in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malindi</ENAMEX>.
        There are far fewer community-based programmes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisumu</ENAMEX>.
        The categorizing of urban areas into strata reflects a
        compilation of ecological factors such as the topographical
        slope and drainage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in the area, the condition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of drains and sewerage systems, rubbish
        collection and other factors. This is essentially a
        community level measure of wealth. This contrasts to wealth
        as measured at the household level. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>-level
        stratification captures factors that are difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control for</ENAMEX>, such as quality and condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in
        the area, variation in how much a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> takes care of
        its immediate environment (civic pride or responsibility),
        and resources the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> can access, such as municipal
        vector control, municipal maintenance of drains and water
        mains and paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. Our analysis suggests that these
        unmeasured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> level differences are significant for
        the most affluent, and poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>.
        Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> should consider that in the poorer areas,
        where the great majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live, even those who are
        relatively better off, need help as there are factors
        operating beyond their immediate control at the community
        level that influence their ability to share resources and
        protect themselves from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>.
        The results of this study demonstrate the importance of
        examining human-mosquito interaction in terms of how access
        to resources, including education and financial resources,
        may enhance human activities and help determine if and how
        they subsequently protect themselves from mosquito bites.
        The findings illustrate that the poorest segments of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> are already doing many things to protect themselves
        from being bitten, but they are doing less than their
        richer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbours</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallop and Sachs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] discuss the
        thesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> not only reflects
        considerable poverty, but the disease may actually be a
        cause of that poverty. Certainly, our results could be
        interpreted as contributing to this thesis. If the poorer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, motivated by the similar urge for a peaceful
        nights sleep as their richer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, insist on paying
        out of pocket for the relatively more expensive protective
        methods, then it is easy to see that just the act of
        attempting to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> from biting may be helping
        to keep these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> from improving their well-being as
        well as their health status.
