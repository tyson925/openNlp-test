        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> of gene expression is central to all cellular
        processes. Transcription factors (TFs) often function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, in which a regulatory protein controls the
        expression of another, which in turn may modulate the
        expression of other regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>, or control genes
        encoding structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or enzymes. These hierarchical
        arrangements allow specific signals to be amplified, and
        provide the information necessary for given sets of genes
        to be deployed with particular space and temporal patterns.
        Thus, an emerging theme in regulation of gene expression is
        the identification of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in which TFs
        participate to specify the temporal and spatial expression
        of all genes in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in making this
        possible is the identification of the entire complement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> and the corresponding 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of all genes.
        The completion of the sequencing and annotation of the
        entire 
        Arabidopsis genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] has provided
        a unique opportunity to start exploring the regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> present in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> are usually classified
        according to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain is responsible for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recruiting TFs</ENAMEX> to specific 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the genes they regulate. In 
        Arabidopsis , previous studies
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,500</NUMEX> TF genes grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 34</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are specific to the
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> or have dramatically expanded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
        compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRKY</ENAMEX>), suggesting
        that they may participate in regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> unique to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are much larger in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, as
        for example the homeo-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Only a small fraction
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~200</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX>+ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TFs</ENAMEX> have been genetically
        characterized, and direct target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> (i.e. genes
        to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> bind and activate) have been identified in
        just a handful of those cases. Despite the general interest
        in investigating the function of all 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2010</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/pubs/2001/nsf01162/nsf01162.</ENAMEX>html, and
        the knowledge on the number and classification of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TFs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , no resource
        is currently available to obtain all the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TF</ENAMEX> sequences or
        information on their possible binding sites. While several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are available to search for putative 
        cis -regulatory motifs in a DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, no initiative has been taken in carrying out this
        process at a genome-wide level. For example, PlantCARE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://oberon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rug</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.be:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8080/PlantCARE/</ENAMEX>index.html, a 
        cis -regulatory element database for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, contains information about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> TF
        binding sites in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. From these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX> binding
        sites, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">281</NUMEX> correspond to dicots. Clearly, this information
        is just a fraction of the total 
        cis -regulatory regions present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> .
        In the quest to determine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TF</ENAMEX> function and
        establish the regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that control the
        expression of all Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the development of a
        web-based resource that divides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
        allows the rapid download of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TF</ENAMEX> sequence
        and the fast identification of mutants, linked to the
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> to which these TFs may bind in the
        Arabidopsis genome is of pressing urgency. Providing these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and starting to link <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> to target genes is the
        basic motivation behind the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRIS</ENAMEX>. Here we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">describe AGRIS</ENAMEX>, constituted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtTFDB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtcisDB</ENAMEX>. AtTFDB
        is a downloadable database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,375</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TF</ENAMEX> sequences with
        information on available mutations in the corresponding
        genes. As information on the expression patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> is
        generated, the information will be added to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtTFDB</ENAMEX>. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtcisDB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtcisDB 1.0</NUMEX>) contains an
        annotation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,975</NUMEX>
        annotated 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtcisDB</ENAMEX> is linked
        to AtTFDB when binding sites for specific transcription
        factors have been identified. Together, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRIS</ENAMEX> provides a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in establishing the regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that
        regulate the expression of all Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtTFDB Database</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtTFDB</ENAMEX> consists of a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> TF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) grouped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
          Information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> can be viewed through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> portals:
          (i) by browsing the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to get a complete
          list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TF genes</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) by searching for
          a specific gene by locus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AtXgXXXX</ENAMEX> format), or
          using any word found in the description or family name.

          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF</ENAMEX>, for entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or for the entire collection can be directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downloaded</ENAMEX> in FASTA format. There are also links to
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hidden Markov Models and Motifs</ENAMEX>
          files of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for direct download.
          A previous analysis of the complete 
          Arabidopsis thaliana genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> suggested the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1500</TIMEX> TFs with
          recognizable motifs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . A search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> website
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.orgindicated that very few TF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> can be retrieved using a search with the key
          words "transcription factor" or "regulatory protein". In
          addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (MYB & WRKY) were
          identified and listed within the "gene family page"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/info/genefamily/genefamily.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX>, a combination of BLAST and motif
          searches was used based on the available literature on
          known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX>, or on motifs conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> from a
          family. A few smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were identified directly
          from published literature (i.e.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCAAT-Dr1 & E2F-DP</ENAMEX>).
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were found through a domain search and
          blast technique. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publications</ENAMEX> were found through PubMed
          and the conserved domain motif that characterizes each TF
          family was identified. Using the motif, a Blast was
          conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> website, the resultant sequences
          were then aligned and mismatches were discarded. Another
          approach, especially for large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> where very few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> had been identified, was an iterative Blast approach.
          A few representative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were used to perform a
          Blast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> website. The resultant sequences with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -5were considered a good
          match, then the last sequence was used in a subsequent
          Blast, and so forth until all similar sequences were
          identified, then they were aligned, and any mismatched
          sequences were discarded. There are some discrepancies
          between the previously estimated number of transcription
          factors per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riechmann et al.</ENAMEX> and those
          listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRIS</ENAMEX>. These may be explained due to further
          genome refinement after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> publication or
          because of our more stringent analysis, although we
          continue to add more transcription factors on a daily
          basis. After identifying the sequences, a script
          performed an automatic gathering of information from
          public online repositories using the list of gene names
          to populate the database. This database was curated
          semi-automatically by discarding duplicated entries,
          unknown genes and outliers, the last ones being
          identified by hand looking at the alignments of the
          sequences of each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In addition,
          transcription factors that were not readily aligned with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, but have been documented and studied were
          placed together in the appropriately named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Orphans</ENAMEX>
          Family". The results included <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1375</TIMEX> transcription factors,
          which were subsequently placed into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> TF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The breakdown of transcription factors into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and the queries used for their identification is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtcisDB Database</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtcisDB</ENAMEX> is an integrated database of promoter
          sequences with annotations of 
          cis -regulatory elements. The
          current version of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AGRIS</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 5</NUMEX>' promoter
          regions, binding sites have also been identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
          regions and introns, but they are limited in number and
          for the time being not represented. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> can search
          AtcisDB for a specific gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> or the direct target
          genes of a specific transcription factor. The current

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DB 1.0</NUMEX>, consists of promoter

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> nt. The transcriptional
          regulation of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being organized as bidirectional
          gene pairs and what distinguishing them from other
          unidirectional promoter genes is mostly unclear.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main features of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis DB</ENAMEX> is mapping of experimentally
          known and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">computationally</ENAMEX> predicted (see Methods for
          details) TF binding sites to their respective gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX>, and display in graphical form. To date the
          website contains mainly predicted binding sites, but by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1, 2003</TIMEX> the goal is to integrate experimentally
          proven binding sites highlighted to show their
          significance. In addition, a web page is being developed
          that will provide a complete list of transcription factor
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and a reference for each. While the
          experimentally known 
          cis -regulatory information is
          rather limited, the use of high throughput micro-array
          expression studies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX> have generated
          transcript profiles of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> so as to infer
          the functions of known and putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] have showed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> of genes responsive to different
          treatments are enriched with known TF binding sites for
          those responses. They also identified a novel promoter
          motif in genes responding to a broad set of pathogen
          infection treatments. Klok 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] identified genes
          involved in low-oxygen response to 
          Arabidopsis root cultures by using
          cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, with similar sequence motifs
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of genes with similar expression
          profiles. Similar studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] found common binding
          sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions of genes responsive to
          various conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRIS</ENAMEX> will be complemented by
          extensive searches of publicly available microarray
          expression data to include all such information about TFs
          and their regulatory motifs present in their target gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          We also provide a web page at our database, where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis DB</ENAMEX> can report back any of the
          validated annotations of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis DB</ENAMEX> from their experiments. This
          facilitates the generation of a draft-annotated version

          A Web interface for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRIS</ENAMEX> has been developed using the

          result for a specific promoter, using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Promoter Id</ENAMEX> (same

            Genome
            We downloaded the annotated coding sequences and the
            chromosomal sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ftp://ftp.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigr</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>(updated
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 17, 2003</TIMEX>). We mapped the coding sequences to the
            chromosomal sequences by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLAT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Then, for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, if the upstream intergenic region is greater than
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb, we retrieved the sequence upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">length 3 kb.</ENAMEX> Otherwise, we consider that intergenic
            region as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the downstream gene, to exclude
            any coding region of upstream genes. We will repeat
            this process immediately after the release of every new
            annotation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIGR</ENAMEX> so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> in
            AtcisDB are based on latest annotations.

            sequences for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
            We have collected consensus-binding sequences for
            known transcript factors from literature and maintain
            that information as a database in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AtTFDB</ENAMEX>. We are
            providing a draft annotation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DB 1.1</NUMEX> by computational
            methods. We have developed computer programs to scan
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis DB</ENAMEX> for transcription factor
            binding sites based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the following two
            approaches: 
            (a) Scanning for consensus binding
            sites: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AtTFDB</ENAMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFs</ENAMEX> and their consensus
            binding sites. We have developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts to scan
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> for consensus binding site occurrence. 
            (b) Position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weight Matrix Methods</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX>) to scan known binding sites: We have prepared
            position-weight matrices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] of those 
            Arabidopsis transcription factors
            for which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX>-10 experimentally known binding
            sites exist. While the number of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TFs</ENAMEX> with these
            properties is still small, it is rapidly growing. PWMs
            have been used to estimate the likelihood that a given
            sequence binds to a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . If a PWM
            exists for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF</ENAMEX>, we follow approach (b). Otherwise
            approach (a) is carried out. We are refining these
            annotations by combining information from the AtTFDB
            database.

          The database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">schema AtcisDB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtTFDB</ENAMEX> are shown in
          Figures 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> tables are used to store the promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and their cis-regulatory element annotation
          information.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">• BindingSite</ENAMEX> table stores the transcription factor
          binding site's information.
