        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Between 10% and 20%</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> experience postpartum
        depression within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months of</TIMEX> delivery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        It is a significant mood disorder that affects the
        well-being of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>. Depressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> have been found to display negative behaviors
        towards their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, which have been shown to adversely
        affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> during infancy and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> childhood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . A more minor and transient condition known as
        postpartum blues has a much higher incidence, affecting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Its symptoms, which include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weeping</ENAMEX>, sadness, irritability, anxiety, and confusion,
        often resolve by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second week</TIMEX> of delivery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , but
        can still have a negative impact on postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in
        the precarious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> following birth.
        There has been much speculation on possible causes for
        mood alterations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the postpartum period</TIMEX>. Most research
        has focused on hormonal changes, previous history of
        psychiatric disorders, and social milieu as main risk
        factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postpartum depression</ENAMEX>. Low postpartum estrogen
        levels as well as increased peripartum testosterone levels
        have been associated with increased depressive and anger
        symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Even lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> have
        been linked with symptoms of anxiety, anger, hostility, and
        depression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the postpartum period</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . As the
        diversity of implicated risk factors suggests, postpartum
        mood disorders, like many psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, most likely
        have a multifactorial etiology which has not been well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delineated</ENAMEX>.
        Consequently, effective therapy has been difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">define</ENAMEX>, especially with the added complication of treatment
        effects on the infant for nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. So far the
        mainstay of treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postpartum depression</ENAMEX> has rested
        with oral antidepressants, specifically the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSRI</ENAMEX>'s. This
        option has frequently generated concern over the potential
        effects of exposure to the infant through breast-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, there has been the drive to search for alternative
        methods of treating postpartum mood disorders that minimize
        the risk of infant exposure through breast-feeding. Parry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> demonstrated the beneficial effect late-night sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> had on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had met the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> criteria
        for major depressive disorder with onset within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postpartum</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The efficacy of interpersonal
        psychotherapy was demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Hara et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grigoriadis et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> reviewed the role of estrogen in
        treating reproductive-related mood disorders [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Exercise, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-reduction techniques, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John's Wort</ENAMEX>, and
        acupuncture have been suggested as potential therapies
        without definitive evidence for significant benefit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corral et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> reported cases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> postpartum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> suffering from a major depressive episode with
        postpartum onset who each experienced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> reduction in
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> depression scale scores after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> of
        morning bright light therapy via a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-lux light box [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] .
        Low levels of illumination at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn or dusk</TIMEX> are commonly
        thought to be associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> affective disorder,
        popularizing the concept of light therapy. Research in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two decades</TIMEX> has demonstrated the usefulness of light
        therapy in other forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. In a review by Kripke
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, light therapy was presented as significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expediting</ENAMEX> and improving the symptoms of non-seasonal
        depression both when used alone and in combination with
        other forms of antidepressant treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . When
        combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antidepressant medications</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        studies from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 and 1994</TIMEX> demonstrated that bright light
        therapy added a relative advantage of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . In
        another study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neumeister et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, light therapy
        decreased symptoms by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 35%</NUMEX> compared with placebo,
        when combined with antidepressant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and late-night
        sleep deprivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . These effects surpass that
        demonstrated by antidepressant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, alone, over placebo,
        which recent meta-analyses have described as improving
        symptoms by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8% to 19%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Bright white light
        therapy has been shown to significantly reduce depression
        and premenstrual symptoms in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with late luteal phase
        dysphoric disorder during their menstrual cycles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX>
        ] . The lower cost, shorter duration of treatment, and lack
        of overt transmission through breast-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, relative to
        extensive interpersonal psychotherapy or antidepressant
        pharmacotherapy, makes light therapy a potentially viable
        and appealing alternative treatment for postpartum mood
        disorders.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espiritu et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX> showed that low levels of light exposure
        were not necessarily reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> already
        diagnosed with a depressive disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Their survey
        of randomly selected middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> revealed that it was common for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of
        this sunny climate to only be exposed to illumination
        levels greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> lux for a mere average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">58 minutes</TIMEX>
        per day [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> who spent less time in bright
        illumination were also found to have scored higher on
        atypical seasonal affective disorder mood questionnaire
        items [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Their results suggested that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>,
        in general, may not be receiving sufficient light exposure
        to maintain optimal mood [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Likewise, it is plausible that postpartum adult women
        have an additional reason to be subject to less than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX> levels of light. This study examines the levels of
        illumination experienced by postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in their
        ordinary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> routine and explores the nature of the
        relationship between their light exposure levels and any
        abnormal mood symptoms experienced during the postpartum
        period. We hypothesized that postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who were
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> since giving birth experience lower levels
        of illumination than the average adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>
        and that this may be due to more time spent indoors caring
        for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>. We also hypothesized that the more
        depressive mood symptoms in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are correlated
        with decreasing levels of illumination.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Recruitment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were recruited from a general outpatient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pediatric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Perlman Ambulatory Center</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSD Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> serves a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from the middle and
          upper-middle class suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego County</ENAMEX>. Subjects
          targeted were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> under one
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year of age</TIMEX> for routine well-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> examinations. The
          definition of postpartum as within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> of delivery
          was implemented to expand the potential sample pool.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Referrals</ENAMEX> came from the practices of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> primary care
          pediatricians at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>. If interest was confirmed,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> signed an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>-approved
          consent and was sent home with the necessary materials to
          complete the study for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three days</TIMEX>. A total of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were eventually recruited for the
          study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
          Each subject was instructed to wear an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actillume</ENAMEX> wrist
          device for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 consecutive hours</TIMEX>, whether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekday</TIMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weekend</ENAMEX>, to record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her daily</TIMEX> exposure to light. Light
          recorded from the wrist is highly correlated with
          measurements taken from the forehead above the eyes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were encouraged to wear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actillume</ENAMEX> at all
          times with the exception of bathing and to carry on with
          her normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities during the recording period.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the three days</TIMEX> of light recording, one of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> (EW) visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> at her home to
          retrieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actillume</ENAMEX>, and administered a written
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-page screening mood questionnaire to rate her mood
          levels during the recording period [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> asked the subject to rate the frequency she
          experienced depressed feelings, restless sleep, enjoyment
          of life, crying spells, sadness, and dislike by others
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional questions asked if
          the subject had ever experienced depressive symptoms for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more weeks</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, and if she had ever
          experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more years</TIMEX> of dysthymic mood in her
          life.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actillume</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ardsley</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) is a tiny wrist monitor containing a photometer and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> accelerometer that measures activity. Recordings
          of light exposure and activity level were made every
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute, twenty-four hours a day</TIMEX>, and stored inside the
          computer memory. A cosine-fitting function was used to
          convert the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> data of lux measurements into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesors</ENAMEX> (means of fitted cosines) of log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [lux], which correct for biases due
          to the time of day that sampling began for each subject
          and for missing data. For example, if some subjects
          removed the recorder for bathing in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and
          others bathed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, the simple means would be biased
          by the time when the recorder was removed for bathing,
          but the cosine-fitting would tend to correct partly for
          the time-of-day missing data. The logarithmic transform
          was used both because the biological response may be
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> related to the logarithm of illumination
          intensity and because the distribution of lux
          measurements was highly skewed (both within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>). Comparison was made by a t-test to see
          if there was any significant difference in illumination
          between postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and the control sample.
          The control sample consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> between the
          ages of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 and 44</NUMEX> (mean age <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35.35 SD 6.64</NUMEX>), selected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> telephone dialing, who also had light exposure and
          activity levels recorded with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actillume</ENAMEX> in a manner
          similar to the postpartum sample. These recordings
          occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months of July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> between the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years 1990 and 1994</TIMEX>. No effect of age or neighborhood on
          amount of light exposure was found in this sample,
          providing an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to compare data with that
          of the postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Mood symptoms were not surveyed
          in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          Mood level ratings were plotted against each subject's
          mean illumination level, and the relationship between
          light exposure and depressive symptoms among all subjects
          was tested for correlation using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> rank-order
          test.
        
      
      
        Results
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages of 19 and 43</TIMEX>, and who
        were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1 and 48 weeks</TIMEX> postpartum, were recruited
        (mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32 SD 8.43</NUMEX>). All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> completed the
        study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> reported herself to be an adoptive rather
        than biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was the
        primary caregiver of the infant since birth and was not
        excluded. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postpartum</ENAMEX> (median = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, mean <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 SD 12.77</NUMEX>). None of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had reported a previous diagnosis of
        postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> reported a previous
        history of crying spells, not going out, or "depressed
        mood" after the birth of a previous but not the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> specifically reported symptoms
        consistent with a major depressive episode.
        From the sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the mean log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [lux] of light exposure for the group
        as a whole was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.06 SD 0.29</NUMEX> with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.63</NUMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        From the sample of the fifteen postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
        participated in the study, the mean log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [lux] of light exposure for the group
        as a whole was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.01 SD 0.24</NUMEX> with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        There was no significant difference between the overall
        mean illumination levels of postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (t = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.57</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>). There was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power to
        distinguish the mean log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [lux] of the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from a
        mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX> or less among postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test, alpha = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>). Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fifteen postpartum</ENAMEX> women
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sampled</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> experienced individual light exposure levels
        that were lower than the mean level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.06</NUMEX> experienced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        The postpartum sample's mean mood score was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> out of a
        possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>. A higher score implicated lower mood levels.
        The highest score was an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> scored higher
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>, which is a screening criterion for depression.
        Lower mood levels were not correlated with decreasing
        levels of mean light exposure in the postpartum sample
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Rather, the plot suggests a trend of higher
        illumination correlating with lower mood levels, but this
        was not significant (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        In this postpartum sample, the responsibilities and
        lifestyle changes of caring for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> did not affect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s normal propensity to expose herself to light,
        whether outdoors, in areas of her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that receive natural
        light through windows, or under artificial lighting of an
        indoor environment.
        The observations are limited to the environment studied.
        Specifically, the light recordings took place during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months of July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
        The climate, especially during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, is predominantly
        sunny with mild temperatures (average: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 degrees</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centigrade</ENAMEX>), providing an environment conducive to going
        outdoors or opening the windows, even with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Under this environment, the average postpartum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> who does not have other reasons to avoid light, is
        able to carry on her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities, including the care
        of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>, without sacrificing her exposure to light
        that regulates circadian rhythms responsible for many
        normal biological functions. Under a different environment,
        such as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of more extreme climate, new factors
        might be introduced that are sufficiently sensitive to the
        infant to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> away from natural light, more
        than it would if she did not have infant care
        responsibilities.
        These results should not be interpreted to mean that
        postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> receive optimal amounts of light exposure.
        In the study of light exposure experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 40 and 64</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espiritu et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the sample were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the median
        adult only spent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.0%</NUMEX> of his time in light that was greater
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> lux [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , a level that is akin to the light
        found outdoors in the shade. (Full unobstructed sunlight
        would be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2000</TIMEX> lux and greater.) Although the
        proportions of time that postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> spent in specific
        levels of light were not analyzed here, a mean exposure
        level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX> log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [lux] which equates to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2</NUMEX> lux would
        not suggest that postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> spent a large proportion
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their day</TIMEX> exposed to levels greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lux</ENAMEX>,
        either. Plots of each subject's data also confirmed that
        times when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was exposed to greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> lux
        were few and mostly during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>. According to Espiritu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX>, these illumination levels are well below the
        representation of the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">photoperiod</ENAMEX>, and it was in a
        portion of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who spent less time exposed to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> lux who reported substantial depressive symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] . Additionally, these levels are well below that shown to
        be of beneficial effect in bright light therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        The postpartum sample in this study as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was not any
        better at obtaining optimal amounts of light; however,
        postpartum status did not make it any worse.
        The demonstration that lower mood levels in the
        postpartum sample did not correlate with lower light can be
        attributed to several factors. The health of this group was
        generally good. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was in the study sample who met
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> criteria for major depression, as determined by the
        mood questionnaire, although they were not excluded. A few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported prior symptoms representative of maternity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blues</ENAMEX>, but they did not experience these symptoms during
        the study. A summertime effect of the lack of postpartum
        mood symptoms is possible, but additional research is
        needed to investigate the significance of seasonal
        variation in postpartum mood symptoms. Given their overall
        low mean mood score, the sample in this study might not be
        truly representative of all postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and
        certainly did not include those with serious postpartum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.
        Postpartum mood alterations, similar to mood changes
        that occur in other contexts, most likely have a
        multifactorial etiology. This phenomenon is especially
        probable during a time when many other rapid changes are
        occurring for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, physiologically and socially. It
        is not likely that reduced light exposure, alone, could
        explain why a postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> develops the blues or more
        serious depression. In light of the observations that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">affective disorders</ENAMEX> can be explained by phase-shifts in
        circadian rhythms that are correctable by light therapy [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postpartum depression</ENAMEX> may benefit from
        critically-timed bright light regardless of their baseline
        level of light exposure. Circadian rhythms in postpartum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are likely to suffer disturbances secondary to
        significant changes in estrogen and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>, which
        have been shown to advance and delay rhythms, respectively
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and it is plausible that bright light can help
        alleviate this. More investigation is needed in the area of
        light exposure or light therapy in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are
        concurrently experiencing depressive symptoms or have a
        history of psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> were not exposed to
        reduced light compared with non-postpartum control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        nor was low mood correlated with low light. Given the
        study's limitations, the results do not dismiss the ideas
        that low levels of light could be a factor associated with
        postpartum affective disorders, or that bright light
        therapy might be a beneficial treatment option.
