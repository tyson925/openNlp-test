        Cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> is fundamental to all
        developmental processes and is essential for cellular
        proliferation. Morphogenesis depends on the interactions of
        steady state and dynamic physical properties that allow a
        cell to deform and reform into different shapes, such as
        neuronal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> and columnar epithelia. Identifying
        the mechanical properties of cells that allow them to
        undergo shape changes and elucidating the molecular
        mechanisms that cells use to generate the mechanical forces
        remains the ultimate challenge of understanding cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. One dramatic example of a process in which a
        cell reshapes itself is during the mechanical separation of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> cell into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>.
        In an animal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, cytokinesis involves the generation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in the region of the contractile ring (reviewed in
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). This was first appreciated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rappaport</ENAMEX> demonstrated that the cleavage furrow cortex of
        echinoderm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> produced force that was capable of bending
        a glass needle (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). Using calibrated
        needles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rappaport</ENAMEX> directly measured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractile</ENAMEX> ring produced [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970</TIMEX>'s,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">nonmuscle myosin-II</ENAMEX>, the equivalent of the force producing
        molecule of skeletal muscle, was shown to localize to the
        region of the cleavage furrow cortex, suggesting the
        molecular basis for contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ]
        ). Indeed, subsequent genetic studies revealed a nearly
        ubiquitous requirement for nonmuscle myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ranging from the cellular slime
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molds</ENAMEX> to metazoans (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ).
        One appeal of studying cytokinesis as a model for
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> is its relatively simple geometry
        during normal mitotic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>, which produce equal
        sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells. This theme can be modified for
        specific developmental programs such as the unequal
        cleavages of mammalian female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">meiosis</ENAMEX>. However, during
        standard mitosis, the mother <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> may be modeled as a
        simple sphere, which is deformed in the region of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equator</ENAMEX> to mimic the ingression of the furrow. The furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ingresses</ENAMEX> until a small intercellular bridge forms. The
        intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is severed or resolved, resulting in
        separation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> can
        then be thought of as a series of intermediate cell shapes
        (sphere, cylinder and dumbbell) that are produced along
        this pathway of cleaving the mother cell. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] suggested a model for cytokinesis based on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hooke's Law</ENAMEX>.
        In their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the minimal contractile force required for
        stabilizing each of these intermediate shapes is
        proportional to the global steady state stiffness of the
        cell and is dependent on the extent of furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ingression</ENAMEX>.
        A quantitation of the distribution and flux of each
        factor is essential for developing a physical model for a
        cellular activity. Myosin-II recruitment to the cortex and
        to the cleavage furrow cortex depends on the thick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filament</ENAMEX>-state of this molecular motor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . The
        ability to form thick filaments is regulated by
        phosphorylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> threonines near the tail of the
        long coiled-coil. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is fully phosphorylated,
        it remains largely in the monomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; whereas removal
        of these phosphates allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to assemble into
        thick filaments. Substitution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> threonines with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanines</ENAMEX> produces the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> mutant that behaves like a
        constitutively unphosphorylated myosin-II. It partially
        rescues the myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mhcA</ENAMEX> ) null strain and localizes to
        the cleavage furrow cortex. A quantitative comparison of
        wild type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> can help to constrain
        models about how myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow cortex.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we conduct a detailed ratio imaging study
        using green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP)-labeled wild type and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> and a soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP</ENAMEX> as a volume marker. We
        determine the amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that is in the cleavage
        furrow cortex and monitor the flux of wild type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>. We apply the simple
        mathematical relationship proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        to the geometry of dividing 
        Dictyostelium discoideum cells. By
        considering the stiffness of a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , we
        estimate the minimal required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to cleave a cell as a
        function of the cell's geometry. We then consider the
        mechanical properties of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that have been measured
        using modern biophysical tools [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] to estimate
        how much myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> would be required to generate a
        particular amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. We find that the amount of
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> needed for cytokinesis and the amount of
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> that actually accumulates in the furrow region
        are in good agreement. This analysis provides a useful
        framework for relating the biochemical and biophysical
        properties of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> to the mechanical process of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>.

          Ratio imaging Quantitatively measures <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-Myosin-II</ENAMEX>
          dynamics
          To begin to develop a physical model for cytokinesis,
          we analyzed the changes in the distribution of wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> during the cell cycle
          using ratio imaging. This allowed us to quantify the flux
          of myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> during cytokinesis and to examine the role
          of heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation in this flux. Ratio
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging</ENAMEX> is preferred to other types of microscopy for
          determining local concentrations of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of interest
          because the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is considered simultaneously and
          the signal is normalized to a volume indicator.
          To perform ratio imaging of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX>, it was
          expressed in a myosin-II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mhcA</ENAMEX> ) mutant strain where it
          completely rescued the mutant. It was co-expressed with a
          second form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fused to a nuclear localization signal
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> variants, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Vex1</ENAMEX> and GFP-Bex1
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , have distinct excitation spectra so that
          separate images can be obtained for the two fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and used to generate ratio images. Since NLS-GFP
          is relatively large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27 kDa</NUMEX>), we examined the uniformity
          of its distribution by comparing it to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
          Red-labeled dextran with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 kDa</NUMEX> molecular weight. The
          fluoresecent dextran was introduced into the cytoplasm of
          cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Myosin II</ENAMEX> by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. Ratio images of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> were
          generated using either the dextran or NLS-GFP, as marker
          of cytoplasmic volume, and the results compared. The
          myosin-II concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cortex measured using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96% Â± 0.63%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>; all measurements are
          mean Â± SEM) of that measured using the fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dextran</ENAMEX>. This indicates that the penetration of the
          cortex by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX> was as complete as that by the dextran
          and was therefore not limited by its size. Therefore,
          this NLS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> is suitable as a cytoplasmic volume marker
          with the added benefit of serving as an indicator for
          cells entering mitosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX> was used as
          the volume indicator for all subsequent ratio-imaging
          analyses. Another requirement is that the fluorescence
          intensity remains uniform over the entire thickness of
          the sample so that the signal accurately reflects the
          volume of the sample. We examined the intensity profile
          emitted by a film of purified recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. The
          fluorescence intensity was constant over a range of
          several Î¼m above and below the focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Thus, the experimental setup is appropriate to
          determine the concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> in various
          compartments of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-Î</NUMEX>¼m <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The correction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> images by ratio imaging makes a significant
          difference to the perceived distribution of myosin-II
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>; in particular, myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is more
          concentrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX> and in the cleavage
          furrow cortex than is suggested by uncorrected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> images alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The intensities
          recorded in ratio images are proportional to local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> concentrations and were used to measure the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> and dynamics of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> distribution.
        
        
          Patterns of cortical myosin-II concentration during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> and cytokinesis
          Both wild type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> had a similar
          flux during mitosis but differed in magnitude. During
          interphase, wild type myosin-II concentration in the
          total cortex was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25% Â± 1.4%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>) higher than in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44% Â± 1.5%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>)
          higher in the cortex than in the cytoplasm. Entry into
          mitosis was associated with a drop in cortical myosin-II
          levels: a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9% Â± 1.7%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) decrease for wild type and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12% Â± 2.3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) decrease for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin-II
          (measured between interphase and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>). This
          drop was followed by a period of relatively stable,
          depressed cortical myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> levels that persisted until
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This decrease may correspond
          to the mobilization of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> from pre-existing
          cortical actin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myosin</NUMEX>-II structures and may correlate
          with the redistribution of actin from the cortex to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          Following the onset of anaphase, relative cortical
          myosin-II concentrations of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> rose throughout
          the periods of anaphase and cleavage furrow progression.
          They peaked close to the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell separation
          and returned to interphase levels as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells
          returned to interphase morphology and behavior (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The relative concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> were
          compared for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regions of cells undergoing
          cytokinesis: the furrow cortex, the polar cortex and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Both myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> invariably
          concentrated in the cleavage furrow cortex during
          cytokinesis, though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> mutant did so to a
          greater extent. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> began to concentrate in the
          cortex of the presumptive furrow near the time of nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, and it continued to rise in this region until
          the completion of cytokinesis. The peak concentration of
          wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 Â± 0.14</NUMEX> relative to the
          polar cortex and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0 Â± 0.14</NUMEX> relative to the cytoplasm (n
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). In contrast, the peak concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.2 Â± 0.36</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) relative to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5 Â± 0.49</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) relative to the cortex
          at the poles. After separation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells, the
          concentration of both myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> inherited by
          their posterior ends declined but remained elevated over
          polar concentrations for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Conversion of the concentration ratios into real
          fractional amounts of total myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> at different stages
          of cytokinesis
          To convert the concentration ratios into real amounts
          of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX>, the volumes of each of the cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> (cleavage furrow cortex, total cortex and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>) were calculated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). To do this, we
          modeled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shapes: a sphere at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
          anaphase, a cylinder with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spherical caps at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX>
          anaphase, and a dumbbell with spherical cap domains
          connected by a cylindrical intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. Then, by
          considering that the total amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the
          cell is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, the percentage of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the furrow
          can be calculated at any point during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. Even
          though there is little or no volume change during
          cytokinesis, it should be noted that modeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> as
          these simple shapes does not yield perfect agreement in
          the total calculated volumes between each stage. The
          volume of the sphere appears <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> less than the volume of
          the cylinder while the volumes of the cylinder and
          dumbbell are within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of each other. This is probably
          because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is resting on a surface so that in the
          "spherical" stage it is not perfectly spherical. As the
          cell shape becomes more complex in the subsequent stages,
          the divergence from the ideal shapes is less significant
          and so the calculated volumes are much closer. In either
          case, this result does not affect our ability to
          determine how much myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is in each compartment
          because the concentrations are calculated based on the
          volume of that particular shape (stage). The summary of
          these calculations is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1where</ENAMEX> every
          concentration ratio is reflected as percentages of total
          myosin-II.
          From this analysis, it becomes apparent that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX>
          of the total myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> (wild type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>) remains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> in interphase and throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>, both wild type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin-II
          increase in total cortical myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>
          ((<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%-21%</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">/21%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> ((<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%-24%</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">/24%</NUMEX>), respectively.
          This is reminiscent of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> increase in total surface
          area expected if a spherical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> conserved its volume
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX> and could simply reflect passive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> as a result of the increase in the surface
          area to volume ratio. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>, the amount of
          wild type myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the cleavage furrow cortex peaks
          at the time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is the most cylindrical prior
          to the ingression of the cleavage furrow. At this point,
          there is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8.4%</NUMEX> of the cell's myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          5hexameric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monomers</ENAMEX>) localized to the cleavage furrow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>. Although the concentration of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the
          cleavage furrow cortex increases as cytokinesis
          progresses to completion, the amount of myosin-II
          decreases. This is due to the furrow cortex volume
          decreasing as cytokinesis progresses. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin-II
          shows a different trend. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>, the protein
          progressively accumulates in the furrow cortex until the
          cell completes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, indicating that heavy chain
          phosphorylation normally facilitates removal of wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> from the contractile ring.
        
        
          Where does the cleavage furrow cortex myosin-II
          originate?
          Through this analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), it becomes apparent
          that only a few percent of the total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myosin-</ENAMEX>II
          has to move to account for the observed distributions.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> movement occurs between interphase and the
          spherical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> (onset of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>) in which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          of the total wild type and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of the total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> are released from the cortex to the cytoplasm.
          From the spherical stage to the cylindrical stage the
          amount of total cortical myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> remains constant. For
          wild type myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX>, if the cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were evenly
          distributed in the total cortex, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5%</NUMEX> of the protein
          would already exist in the region of the furrow cortex
          with similar amounts in each polar cortex. To get the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4%</NUMEX> that are observed at the furrow cortex, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of the
          total cellular myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> must move to the furrow cortex
          region. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myosin-</ENAMEX>II
          departs from each polar cortex (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 13%</NUMEX> of the
          total in the polar cortex), suggesting that the flux of
          myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> may be from the polar cortices to the cleavage
          furrow cortex. Similar types of movements are observed
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin-II. To begin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">myosin-II</ENAMEX> would be expected at the furrow cortex if the
          total cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> were evenly distributed.
          Then, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 6%</NUMEX> of the cell's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> is
          recruited to the furrow cortex at the expense of the
          polar cortex.
          As the cell progresses from the cylindrical stage to
          the dumbbell stage, the amount of wild type myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in
          the cortex increases from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21% to 27%</NUMEX> of the total
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myosin-</ENAMEX>II. The concentration of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the
          polar cortex increases by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> while the concentration in
          the furrow cortex increases by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>. This indicates that
          the total cortex gains myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> but the furrow cortex
          gains myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> at a faster rate. Similarly, the amount
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> myosin-II localized to the cortex also
          increases from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24% to 30%</NUMEX> of the total cellular
          myosin-II. However, in this case, the polar cortex
          actually decreases its concentration of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>
          while the furrow cortex increases its concentration by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">250%</NUMEX> during this interval. Thus, for the transition from
          the cylinder to dumbbell stage, the flux of wild type and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> must come largely from the cytoplasm to
          the cortex and myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is recruited into the furrow
          cortex at the expense of the polar cortex. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to
          think of these results is that myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> might diffuse
          into the new cortex volume as the cell increases its
          surface area and myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the thick filament form is
          then recruited to the furrow cortex.
        
        
          Estimation of the minimal force requirements for
          cytokinesis
          To relate the amount of cleavage furrow myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> to
          the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that might be generated by the
          cleavage furrow cortex, we estimated the minimal force
          requirements for cell cleavage using the simple
          mathematical relationship proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          ] . While oversimplified, the results from this analysis
          provide a basic framework for conceptualizing the meaning
          of our quantitative distribution and flux analyses. To
          justify applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan equation</ENAMEX> (equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>), certain assumptions must be met.
          One assumption is that the volume is conserved during
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] described the theoretical
          cell shape changes that occur if conservation of cell
          volume is maintained. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the region of the
          cortex proximal to the cleavage furrow will constrict
          while the polar cortex expands. The proximal and distal
          regions intersect, producing stationary rings. We
          overlaid sequential images of a dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and indeed
          stationary rings are observed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). It can be seen
          that the cross-sectional diameter of the emerging
          daughter cells remains relatively constant if drawn where
          the stationary rings have formed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Further, as
          predicted by the conservation of volume assumption, the
          pole-to-pole distance increases as the furrow radius
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreases</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
          By measuring the cell dimensions and using measured
          interphase cortical stiffnesses (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.55 nN/Î¼m</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] ,
          we calculated the minimal required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for a dividing
          cell at each stage using equations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-3 (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4D</TIMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; see Methods). From this analysis, the peak force
          requirement occurs when the cell acquires a cylindrical
          shape. This level of force persists until the point when
          the radius of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">furrow</ENAMEX> begins to constrict beyond the
          radius of the emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>,
          the cleavage furrow continues to ingress, which results
          in cell shapes that require progressively less
          contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to maintain. By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> has
          assumed a dumbbell shape, the required contractile force
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one third</NUMEX> of that required during the
          cylindrical shape stage.
          The amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> required to produce the needed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> at each point during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was estimated by
          considering the physical properties and cellular
          concentration of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> (see Methods). We performed
          these calculations to approximate the amount of myosin-II
          required at each stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX>
          of the total cellular myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> are required in the
          cylindrical shape and the amount decreases to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5%</NUMEX> by
          the dumbbell shape. The amounts and trends predicted from
          the simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> equation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] are in close
          agreement to the amounts and trends measured by ratio
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myosin-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> is the result of a dynamic steady
        state in which recruitment is offset by thick filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembly</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, a signal that possibly emanates
        from the mitotic spindle instructs the cortex to recruit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> to the furrow cortex and to begin contraction.
        This leads to the elongation of the cell to the cylindrical
        form followed by constriction of the furrow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myosin-II</ENAMEX> is
        recruited until enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has accumulated and the cell
        can constrict in the desired manner. More myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is
        recruited to the furrow cortex when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells are flattened by
        agar overlay when compared to cells grown under standard
        conditions on the surface of a culture plate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Flattening a cell by agar overlay may increase the apparent
        stiffness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by introducing tension into the
        cortex from increased hydrostatic pressure. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Intriguingly,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> null 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells divide relatively
        normally if allowed to adhere to a surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> becomes essential if the adherent cells are grown
        under a sheet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agarose</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        The pathway for myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> disassembly is most likely
        always active and the direction of the steady state depends
        on whether the signal to recruit myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is active.
        Consistent with this concept, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yumura</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] measured the
        turnover of cortically distributed myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> by
        fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and
        showed that wild type myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is localized to the cortex
        with a half-life of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7 seconds</TIMEX>. This cortical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">half-life</ENAMEX> is the same regardless of whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interphase</ENAMEX> or undergoing cytokinesis. On the other hand,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala mutant myosin-II</ENAMEX> has a half-life greater than
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> used to track the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
        quantitation of the distribution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> verifies that phosphorylation-controlled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembly</ENAMEX> is a normal part of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> turnover. The
        amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> enrichment in the furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> might represent normal accumulation of myosin-II
        that is ordinarily offset by the disassembly of the
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> thick filaments possibly as a part of a feedback
        mechanism that senses the mechanical needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
        The data presented here does not distinguish between
        recruitment of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> to the cleavage furrow cortex by
        cortical sliding or recruitment from the cytoplasm. Between
        the period of cytokinesis involving transition from a
        spherical cell shape to a cylindrical shape, there is
        little or no net flux of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> from the cytoplasm to
        the cortex. A simple interpretation is that the myosin-II
        simply slides along the cortex from the poles to the
        cleavage furrow. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRAP</ENAMEX> studies support a model where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dynamic myosin-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">filaments</ENAMEX> progressively slide along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> while exchanging with the cytoplasmic pool of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monomers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . However, between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cylindrical</ENAMEX> and dumbbell stages of cell shape, there is a
        net flux of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> from the cytoplasm to the cortex.
        This flux from the cytoplasm to the cortex may simply
        reflect the increase in the surface area (and consequently
        the cortex volume) to total cell volume ratio and may not
        be specific to cytokinesis per se. Then, cortical flow
        could continue to concentrate the myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> into the furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>. Since more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala myosin-II</ENAMEX> than wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> is recruited to the cleavage furrow cortex, the
        recruitment mechanism is unlikely to be limiting for the
        wild type myosin-II. This suggests that an unlimiting
        regulator molecule may control the localization of
        myosin-II. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for a catalytic regulator molecule
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAKa</ENAMEX> kinase, which is required for myosin-II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> to the cleavage furrow cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> could act on enzymes that regulate the myosin-II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>-state or it could act on a cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> thick filaments.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>, global and spatial mechanical
        properties are likely used to deform a cell, allowing the
        constriction of the cell's equator (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ).
        These spatial properties include local modulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stiffness</ENAMEX> and the generation of contractile force. A
        localized stiffness increase may define the region that is
        deformed during a morphological process. The cleavage
        furrow cortex increases in stiffness above the global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stiffness</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells as determined by atomic force
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This regional increase in stiffness is
        likely to occur in most or all metazoan and ameboid cells.
        For example, in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum, the cortexillin
        actin-filament crosslinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are recruited to the
        cleavage furrow where they are thought to contribute to the
        stiffness of the cleavage furrow cortex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myosin-II</ENAMEX> is probably a major contractile force generator.
        However, direct measurement of this parameter is far more
        difficult in small cells. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have measured
        the amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow cortex. This amount is in close agreement with the
        estimate of the amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that would be required
        to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that may be required to cleave a
        cell.
        The mechanical model presented provides a useful
        framework for conceptualizing the quantitation of
        myosin-II. However, there are many issues that must be
        considered before a comprehensive model for contractile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> production can be developed. First, it should be
        noted that myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> null cells can divide if given a
        surface to which to adhere. The mechanism by which these
        cells divide under these conditions is not known. However,
        by considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of the process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> realizes
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> has the highest need for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> generation
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">elongation</TIMEX> and initial furrow ingression. Traction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> may serve well to elongate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, allowing the
        formation of the cylindrical shape. Indeed, myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> null
        cells in the absence of surface attachment fail to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elongate</ENAMEX>, verifying that myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is required for this
        step when surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">traction</ENAMEX> is not available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gelation</ENAMEX> and solvation factors and possibly an
        unconventional myosin might complete the process once the
        cylindrical shape has been acquired (for further discussion
        see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ). Interestingly, during interphase the myosin-II
        null <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> less stiff in bending modulus and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
        less stiff in surface tension than the wild type parental
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 26</NUMEX> ] . Thus, by considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, one realizes that myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> null cells probably
        require significantly less force to divide, making it
        easier to cleave. Since other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are likely to
        contribute to contractile force production, the
        quantitation of the amount of myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> recruited to the
        cleavage furrow cortex allows us to estimate how much force
        can be provided by myosin-II. In fact, there are adequate
        amounts of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> to generate at least the majority of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that are estimated to be required. It is
        reasonable that the contractile ring may be able to
        generate greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> than is minimally required. Having
        the ability to generate more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> than is minimally
        required may have great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in nature. Environmental
        factors such as cell-cell contact and hypotonicity might
        place additional demands on the equatorial contractile
        apparatus that go beyond the intrinsic stiffness of the
        cell cortex.
        Another issue is that the level of myosin-II activity
        may be able to vary. In muscle, there is load-dependent
        recruitment of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>; in other words, the
        duty ratio of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> can vary (reviewed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        ). For our calculations, we considered the duty ratio to be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006</NUMEX>, which is the value measured for unloaded 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin-II.
        Load-dependent recruitment of crossbridges for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> has not been
        examined so it is not known whether this is important for a
        simple eukaryotic nonmuscle myosin-II. However, this ratio
        may be able to change in a load-dependent manner such that
        the amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow may be able to generate much greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> than
        appear to be minimally required. Myosin-II activity might
        also be predicted to vary as a result of localized
        activation by myosin light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation. However,
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum, myosin light chain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is not required for cytokinesis so this is
        unlikely to be a major consideration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . Finally,
        the ratio imaging experiments do not allow us to make
        conclusions regarding the radial uniformity of the
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in the cleavage furrow cortex. Thus, it is
        possible that the force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is not generated in a
        perfectly symmetrical fashion. However, the contractile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> may not need to be generated in an entirely uniform
        manner to generate the needed forces to stabilize the
        ingression of the cleavage furrow cortex. The quantitation
        of amounts of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> that are recruited to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractile</ENAMEX> ring is an essential starting point for
        developing a more detailed but experimentally tractable
        model for cytokinesis. Given the complex bookkeeping
        involved in accounting for the contributions of each
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> generator to the precise mechanical needs
        of every individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, it is remarkable that the trends
        of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> distribution are so closely predicted by the
        simple theoretical analysis.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Direct measurements of the cortex stiffness and
        contractility as a function of position and time during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX> in wild type and mutant cells will be essential
        to identify the contribution of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>
        of cell shape changes. Examination of the effects of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are involved in cytokinesis such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortexillins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] and dynacortin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] will also be
        necessary to understand how different factors contribute to
        the different mechanical parameters such as stiffness and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractility</ENAMEX>. It should be remembered that in this study
        the agreement between the amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> required in
        the cleavage furrow cortex determined from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hooke's law</ENAMEX> and
        the amount measured using ratio imaging is strictly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlative</ENAMEX>. What is most notable, however, is that the
        trends predicted from the simple model accurately predict
        the trends of myosin-II recruitment to the cleavage furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>. Other more sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for cytokinesis
        have been presented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . However, the value of this
        simple theoretical analysis is that it more accurately
        predicts the trends of contractility, which may be assigned
        in large part to myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> and it can be easily tested in a
        variety of cell types for its validity. If it generally
        provides reliable estimates of the mechanical
        considerations for dividing cells, it would be a useful
        tool for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who are interested in quantitative
        approaches to studying the biology of cytokinesis.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          DNA manipulation and cell culture
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA manipulations</ENAMEX> were carried out using standard
          procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] unless otherwise specified.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS-GFP</ENAMEX> were simultaneously expressed
          from the same extrachromosomal plasmid vector (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p102</NUMEX> in
          the case of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p122</TIMEX> in the case of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Ã— Ala GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX>). To generate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p102</NUMEX>, the coding
          region of Bex1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] was subcloned into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-MyBam</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . The fusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of the
          myosin-II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> gene was subsequently subcloned
          into pBigMyD. The coding region of Vex1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] was
          subcloned into pDXA-3C [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] as described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and
          the NLS-GFP expression cassette subcloned into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p102</TIMEX>. p122
          was made by replacing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' region of the myosin-II
          heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> gene in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p102</TIMEX> with the equivalent fragment
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pBIG-ALA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          All constructs were transformed into the parental JH10
          strain or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HS1</TIMEX>, a myosin-II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> ( 
          mhcA -) null strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , unless
          otherwise indicated. Cells were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Broth20</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] with the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> thymidine for JH10
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml G418</ENAMEX> for plasmid selection. The
          pLD1A15SN:GFP-dynacortin plasmid was transformed into DH1
          cells and the cells were grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enriched</ENAMEX> HL-5
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX> G418 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . For experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX>
          Red-dextran, the fluorescent dextran was electroporated
          into cells.
        
        
          Microscopy
          For microscopic observation, cells were plated in
          chambered coverslips (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nalge Nunc</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> in fresh
          medium, washed once with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging Buffer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mM MES</TIMEX> pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potassium chloride</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM magnesium sulfate,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM calcium chloride) and covered with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> ml of the
          same buffer. Observations were made with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zeiss</ENAMEX> Axiovert
          100TV with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plan-Apo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">63x/1.4 NA</ENAMEX> objective (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Zeiss</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>). Fluorescence images from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-50</NUMEX> ms exposures were
          recorded using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TE/CCD-512TKB</ENAMEX> camera and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST-138</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">controller</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX>) and manipulated
          with Image 1/Metamorph (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Imaging Corp.</ENAMEX>).
          Fluorescence images were collected with triple
          bandpass dichroic (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">450-485 nm, 510-550</ENAMEX> nm and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">590-650</ENAMEX> nm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmitted; Chroma Tech</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hi-Q FITC</ENAMEX> emission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">510-560</ENAMEX> nm transmitted; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chroma Tech</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX>).
          Pairs of images of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bex1</ENAMEX> and Vex1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFPs</ENAMEX> were recorded in
          rapid succession (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><500 ms</ENAMEX>) by switching bandpass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">excitation</ENAMEX> filters <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 479-501 nm</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">398-413</ENAMEX> nm
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambda</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-2 filter wheel controller (Sutter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instrument Co.</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Ratio image analysis
          Image processing was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal steps:
          background subtraction, correction for spectral overlap
          and ratio generation. Mean background signal was measured
          in a region of each image unpopulated by cells and
          subtracted from the entire image. Spectral overlap was
          measured in cells expressing only one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>. These measurements showed that the intensity of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bex1</NUMEX> signal using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Vex1</NUMEX> excitation filter was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0054</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>; all measurements are mean Â± SEM) of the
          Bex1 signal using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bex1</NUMEX> excitation filter. Further, the
          intensity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Vex1</NUMEX> signal using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bex1</NUMEX> excitation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.027 Â± 0.00057</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Vex1</NUMEX> signal
          using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Vex1</NUMEX> excitation filter. These measurements
          allowed the contributions of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to the image
          intended to represent the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to be subtracted out.
          Division of the corrected <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin-II</ENAMEX> image by the
          corrected NLS-GFP image yielded ratio images with pixel
          intensities that are proportional to local myosin-II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (except in the region occupied by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleus</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> regions of dividing cells were defined for
          analysis purposes: the cortex as a whole, the cytoplasm,
          the cortex underlying the cleavage furrow and the cortex
          underlying the poles (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The cytoplasm was
          defined as the entire contents of the cell excluding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> and the nuclei. The cortex was defined as a layer
          with a constant thickness of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.35 Î¼m</NUMEX>. This number is
          justified because the thickness of cortical GFP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myosin</NUMEX>-II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.35 Î¼m</NUMEX> and is consistent
          with published electron micrographs of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cortices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
          . It should be noted that fluorescence that is defined as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> also includes fluorescence from the overlying
          and underlying cortices. However, this amount of cortex
          contributes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2%</NUMEX> of the total fluorescence of the
          cytoplasm, which is within the error of the cytoplasmic
          concentration measurement (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and is, therefore,
          negligible.
          The furrow and polar cortical regions were each
          subsets of the cortex as defined above. The cortex
          underlying the furrow is considered to extend outwards
          from the equator as far as the point of inflection of the
          curvature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This region corresponds
          well to the most advanced part of the furrow and to the
          region in which myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is concentrated. This region
          also contains the contractile ring actin filaments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          . The polar cortex is defined as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cortical regions
          furthest from the equator, these regions being of
          equivalent size to the furrow region as defined above
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). Regions of interest were drawn manually onto
          images and their mean pixel intensities were recorded and
          processed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>). Graphical representations
          were generated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KaleidaGraph</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synergy Software</ENAMEX>).
          To convert the ratios of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> into quantities,
          the volumes of each of the cell regions of were
          calculated from the cell's dimensions. First, the total
          cell volume was determined. Then, the cytoplasm volume
          was calculated by considering the dimensions of the whole
          cell minus the cortex and the cortex volume was
          calculated as the difference between the total cellular
          volume and the cytoplasm volume. To calculate the furrow
          cortex volume at the cylinder stage, the furrow was
          considered to be the "belt" that constricts in subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points. At the cylinder stage it was determined to
          be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the cell's total length. The volume of the
          furrow cortex was calculated as a difference between the
          outer cell cylinder and the inner cytoplasmic cylinder.
          At the dumbbell stage, the cleavage furrow cortex volume
          was calculated as the sum of its parts (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>).
          First, the intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> was modeled as the
          difference between the inner and outer cylinders. The
          portion of the furrow cortex flanking the intercellular
          bridge, which extend upwards to the flexion point of the
          curvature of the main cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, was modeled as a
          difference of inner and outer spherical caps. The small
          fraction of this volume where the intercellular bridge
          intersects the spherical caps was subtracted from the
          furrow cortex volume.
          To determine the fraction of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, the concentration of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in the furrow
          cortex was 
          
            c 
           , the concentration in the cytoplasm was 
          
            c 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/ratio</NUMEX> of furrow cortex to cytoplasm), and the
          concentration in the polar cortex was 
          
            c 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/ratio</NUMEX> of furrow cortex to polar cortex). Then,
          the sum of the products of the concentrations of each
          part multiplied by that part's volume equals <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the
          myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Once 
          
            c 
           is solved for algebraically, the concentrations of
          each part can be determined and the fraction of the total
          cellular myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is the product of the
          concentration and the region's volume.
        
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cell Geometry and Calculation of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minimal Force</ENAMEX> Requirements
          To analyze the cell geometry during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX>,
          dimensions of dividing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells were measured
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image to determine the number of pixels for a
          particular dimension. Calculations were made with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>).
          To calculate the minimal required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to cleave a
          cell, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>'s equation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] :
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î³/R</ENAMEX> 
          f = 2S 
          c (cosÎ˜) <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ Equation</ENAMEX> 1
          where Î³ is the contractile force, R 
          f is the radius of the furrow, S 
          c is the stiffness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cortex
          and Î˜ is the angle between the tangent to the cortex at
          the base of the furrow and the cleavage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4C). We considered S 
          c to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nN/Î¼m</ENAMEX>, which was measured
          using a microcapillary aspiration technique [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . To
          calculate the balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> using the equation
          proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoneda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , the in-plane stiffness
          or surface tension is the appropriate parameter to
          consider. The glass needle indentation method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] has
          also been used to measure the cortical stiffness of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum. However, this method
          mostly measures the bending modulus.
          To determine the minimal force requirements of cells
          undergoing cell division, we analyzed movies of dividing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells. The diameter
          of the cleavage furrow (2R 
          f ) and the pole to pole distance (2Z 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) were measured. The radius (r) of
          each emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell was calculated using the
          following:
          r = (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zp</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rf 2</NUMEX>)/2Z

          Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos(Î˜</ENAMEX>) was calculated from the following:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cos(Î˜</ENAMEX>) = (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zp</ENAMEX> - r)/r <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ Equation</ENAMEX> 3
          The contractile force was then calculated by inputting
          the various quantities and solving for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³</NUMEX>. Parameters were
          plotted versus cell shape (which change as a function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>) to demonstrate how the minimal required contractile
          force varied as a function of cell shape.
          The amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> required to produce a
          particular amount of force was calculated by assuming
          that a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> produces <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 pN</NUMEX> of force
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . To correct for myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>'s duty ratio (t 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s / t</ENAMEX> 
          c ), the following considerations were
          used. The maximum velocity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) for translation of actin
          filaments by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.3 Î</NUMEX>¼m/s
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and the step size is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . If V equals the
          step size divided by the strongly bound state time (t 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ), then t 
          s equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 nm/3300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm</ENAMEX>/s or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">msec</ENAMEX>. The V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> for the actin-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin</ENAMEX>-II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> cycle is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2.5 s -1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the
          total cycle time (t 
          c ) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 400</NUMEX> msec. Thus, the duty
          ratio is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 0.006</NUMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin-II. For
          comparison, the duty ratio for vertebrate skeletal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">myosin-II</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.05</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          To determine the percentage of total cellular
          myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX>, the following assumptions were used to
          calculate the total amount of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> in a cell: total
          protein concentration in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 Î¼g/10</NUMEX> 6cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] , myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of the cell's
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] , the relative molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexameric</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">monomer"</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> each of the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and
          essential and regulatory light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>) of myosin<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-II</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">557</NUMEX> kDa, and the average size of a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 8 Î¼m</NUMEX> in
          diameter when grown on surfaces. To determine the average
          cell size, cultures were grown on surfaces, resuspended
          in media, and the population distribution of the cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diameter</ENAMEX> measured with a Z1 <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coulter</ENAMEX> counter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulter Inc.</ENAMEX>). From this, an average density of myosin-II
          per Î¼m <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3was</TIMEX> determined to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 2000</TIMEX> monomers
          per Î<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¼m 3</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 3.4 Î¼M</NUMEX>) so that the amount of
          myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with a particular volume could be
          estimated, assuming that the average concentration
          remains the same.
