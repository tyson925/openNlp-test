        The presence and abundance of long chain polyunsaturated
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (LC-PUFA) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans diets</ENAMEX> have been the basis
        of scientific investigations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Studies have yet
        to resolve all the mechanisms of action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>, in
        particular the remarkable phenotypic differences between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that consume different quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fish oil</ENAMEX> in their diets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dietary</ENAMEX> LC-PUFA
        affect processes including: growth, neurological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, lean and fat mass accretion, reproduction,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innate</ENAMEX> and acquired immunity, infectious pathologies of
        viruses, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and parasites; and the incidence and
        severity of virtually all chronic and degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, atherosclerosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammatory</ENAMEX>, and skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Due to
        lack of mechanistic knowledge, predictions for optimal
        intake of nutritionally important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> remain vague and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dietary</ENAMEX> recommendations simply relate to prevention of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overt deficiency</ENAMEX>. There is not even scientific consensus on
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> present in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> should be included in
        infant formulas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        The most often cited action of n3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> is that they
        induce alterations in eicosanoids by antagonizing the
        primary substrate of eicosanoid metabolism: arachidonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (AA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Certainly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">n3</TIMEX> LC-PUFA replace AA in
        cellular membranes to some extent and alter eicosanoid
        products, but is this the primary mechanism underlying the
        benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">consuming fish</ENAMEX>? The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">n3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LC-</ENAMEX>PUFA alter
        postprandial lipoprotein production and clearance, and
        lower circulating triglyceride-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        N3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> induce alterations in membrane properties
        including ion transport, trafficking and vesicular
        transport, and alter the transcription of genes encoding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>, lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">desaturation</ENAMEX>, and
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fish oil</ENAMEX> contains, among others, docosahexaenoic acid
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>:6n3) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eicosapentaenoic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:5n3) as
        important components. The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX> and neurological membranes suggests a specific role
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> in the brain. However, neither the mechanism of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> nor the precise role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> in the brain is
        currently well understood [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Rigorous elimination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> and its precursor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>:3n3 from animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diets</ENAMEX> leads to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, but significant, phenotypic effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
        basic biochemical pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> biosynthesis from its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">precursor 18:3n3</ENAMEX> is still being resolved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
        component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil is linked to anti-inflammatory,
        anti-thrombotic, and generally, eicosanoid-mediated effects
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">antagonizing</NUMEX> AA metabolism.
        Arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (AA; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:4n6), either formed from n6
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> in mammals or obtained directly from the diet,
        is believed to exert most of its biological activity via
        conversion to various eicosanoids. N6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>, and
        especially AA, are also now recognized to elicit
        significant physiological effects when consumed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>. The lack of significant commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of AA has
        limited the study of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> (FA) as a dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> until relatively recently. Due to the
        commercialization of fungal biomass production to produce
        very high levels of AA as a storage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, it is now possible
        to study this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX>.
        Until recently, LC-PUFA effects on gene transcription
        were thought primarily to be mediated by a single subfamily
        of orphan nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> - peroxisome proliferator
        activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (PPARs); however, it is now becoming
        evident that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAs</ENAMEX> can affect many different genes either via
        direct interactions or indirectly through additional
        transcription factors including hepatic nuclear-4α
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HNF-4α</ENAMEX>), nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor κβ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-κβ</ENAMEX>), retinoid <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> receptor α
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRα</ENAMEX>), sterol regulatory element binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-1c
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver X receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRβ</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Indeed, the enthusiasm for uncovering the biological
        pathways underlying the beneficial actions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> has
        revealed a story that is increasingly more complex than
        originally supposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , thereby making microarray
        technology an ideal platform to further decipher the many
        roles of these nutritional lipids.
        In the present work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were fed control diets
        adequate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18:2n6 and 18:3n3</TIMEX> but lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>; or a
        diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enriched</ENAMEX> in fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX>) enriched in AA, the n6
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX> and desaturation product of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>:2n6; or a diet
        containing fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) enriched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22:6n3 and 20:5n3</TIMEX>,
        the major n3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> elongation and desaturation products
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>:3n3; or a diet containing both fungal oil and fish
        oil (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>). Thereafter, gene expression profiling was
        performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs in parallel with quantitative
        metabolic profiling of a broad spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver FAs</ENAMEX>.
        Tissues of interest were liver, the major lipid
        metabolizing tissue; and brain, the major neurological
        tissue and principal site for accumulation and
        functionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> (and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>). The
        hippocampus brain region was specifically chosen because of
        its importance in memory and learning [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Liver and
        brain are metabolically connected organs as both AA and DHA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> the blood brain barrier via several possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. Diets were fed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57 days</TIMEX> to study chronic and
        sustained alterations in control of gene expression rather
        than acute effects.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Body weight, feed intake, and incorporation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dietary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> into tissue membranes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were fed relatively low fat diets to minimize the
          accretion of body fat and to avoid the confounding
          effects that LC-PUFA -rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX> are known to exert on
          the progression of obesity. Body weight and the change in
          body weight (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">d58 minus d1</NUMEX>) were not affected by dietary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> modulation ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>). Feed intake data showed
          no significant differences amongst <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (classic ANOVA
          considering the cages and diets as cofactors; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). There were also no
          obvious differences in brain and liver weights ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). By these criteria,
          differences in gene expression and metabolic profiles
          described herein were judged to be linked to the FAs
          present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FISH oils</ENAMEX> on healthy, normal weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          The incorporation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20:4n6 and 22:4n6</TIMEX> following
          feeding of the AA-rich FUNG diet, and the incorporation
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20:5n3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22:5n3</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22:6n3</TIMEX> following feeding of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA/DHA</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH diet</ENAMEX>, into whole brain, hippocampal,
          and hepatic phospholipid (PL) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) was further
          evidence the diets were consumed, resulting in
          significant changes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PL</ENAMEX> acyl composition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> oil
          feeding is well established to increase n3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatic PL</ENAMEX> as well as whole brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ; whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> of n3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> can decrease <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22:6n-3 in</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampal PL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . DHA present in the brain can be
          formed from precursors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or astrocytes, and
          intact DHA passes the blood brain barrier via selective
          transport mechanisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These data confirm that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diets</ENAMEX> did result in actual increases in the brain of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appropriate FAs</ENAMEX> and set the stage for interpreting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> responses observed in each organ.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, our lipid profiling data revealed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH FAs</ENAMEX> were not identically incorporated into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual PL</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs studied (partly shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and this may affect subsequent transcription
          factor signaling. For example, there was consistently
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> AA accumulating in various hepatic PL than in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> following AA feeding; and more DHA
          accumulated in hepatic cardiolipin (CL) than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampal CL</ENAMEX>, whereas the reverse was true for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylinositol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS/PI</ENAMEX>). Thus,
          there are several explanations for why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> feeding resulted in different transcriptional
          profiles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and hippocampus, as discussed
          subsequently.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Expression</ENAMEX> analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes induced by the dietary
          treatments were selected using a limit fold change (LFC)
          model, in addition to a more conventional confidence
          interval test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Genes that satisfied the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> LFC
          model and which lay above the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> confidence interval
          of pooled replicates were selected as differentially
          expressed. It should also be noted that for the liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, inter-individual variation was examined. All genes
          selected as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed using pooled data in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> also laid outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.0%</NUMEX> confidence interval
          when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> mouse variability, thereby
          lending additional confidence to the selection method
          used with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and hippocampus data. According
          to these criteria, which involves examining all possible
          pair-wise comparisons between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> diets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">329 and 356</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes were selected in the liver
          and hippocampus, respectively. In the present document,
          genes that are discussed are followed by parentheses
          indicating fold changes according to the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convention</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FUNG</ENAMEX> versus control diet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> versus control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> versus control diet, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G6pc</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.6*, -1.9*</TIMEX>). Those
          fold changes that are significant by the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are
          further identified with an asterisk (*). It is important
          to note that the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model allows
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes to be selected based on
          differences between the treatments, and therefore
          explains why some genes discussed in the text have no
          fold changes marked with an asterisk (as significance was
          observed between treatments and not versus the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver genes</ENAMEX> discussed in the present
          manuscript are found in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(green dots) and lie
          within the range of validation data (black squares). The
          high degree of concordance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>- reported in detail elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] )
          establishes a certain level of confidence in the results
          discussed throughout this manuscript.
          To understand the trends in transcriptional response
          within and between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs studied, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> using GO classifications; a dynamic,
          structured, yet precisely defined system which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">characterizes genes</ENAMEX> based on defined categories of
          molecular function, biological process, and cellular
          component [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Since the GO classifications contain
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descriptors</ENAMEX>, many differentially
          expressed genes had a unique annotation. Record counts
          for most GO identifiers were not high, although a number
          of significant trends were observable. Venn diagrams were
          constructed for the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> GO descriptors for each
          category, according to record count, to visualize broad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> responses induced by dietary LC-PUFA
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The interpretation of transcriptomic data,
          especially that stemming from a nutritional study such as
          this, benefits greatly from such a classification system.
          The diverse whole-body effects of LC-PUFA render
          individual gene interpretation difficult; however,
          considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes reveals preliminary
          information concerning the biological mechanisms
          responding to the addition of dietary LC-PUFA.
          The GO analysis and specific gene expression patterns
          were interpreted to indicate that LC-PUFA-enriched oils
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver metabolism</ENAMEX> through the regulation of genes
          directly involved in FA metabolism and lipid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">binding/</ENAMEX>transport (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), as previously reported in
          rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . When examining GO classifications for the
          hippocampus, such descriptors as cell signaling and cell
          cycle control are seen in response to dietary LC-PUFA.
          This result was expected, as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs have very
          different biochemical roles and import dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FA</ENAMEX> via
          distinctly different means. The tissue functions were
          reflected in the transcriptomic profile. Although there
          were relatively few overlapping functions between the two
          organs, the most prominent overlapping function indicated
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> was affecting genes related to transcription
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA/RNA</ENAMEX>-binding.
        
        
          Hepatic gene expression analysis and transcription
          factor signatures
          It is difficult to interpret transcriptional profiling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> alone, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dimerization</TIMEX>, post-translational
          modifications, relative quantities of co-activators and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-repressors</ENAMEX>, and the formation of multiple
          transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> binding to common promoter
          regions ultimately determines the binding activation
          potential of transcription factors. Nevertheless,
          clustering analysis of differentially regulated genes
          revealed numerous genes known to be regulated by specific
          transcription factors, thereby enabling several
          transcription factor signatures to be established. These
          signatures then provide clues concerning the various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> through which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> may effect gene transcription.
          Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH diets</ENAMEX> regulated some
          transcription factors not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) previously associated
          with these dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX>, thereby indicating novel LC-PUFA
          mediated molecular mechanisms of action. These include:

          present work, the focus will be on transcription factors
          previously identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of LC-PUFA actions,
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNFs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> are nuclear hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that are activated
          by micromolar concentrations of various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAs</ENAMEX> and FA
          analogues, such as fibrates and thiazolidinediones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          . This subfamily can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> isotypes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">designated PPARα</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARδ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARγ</ENAMEX>, each with
          tissue-specific expression. PPARs form heterodimers with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">retinoid X</ENAMEX> receptor (RXR), and interact with the
          peroxisome proliferator response element (PPREs) in gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPREs</ENAMEX> are direct repeats (DR) of a
          hexanucleotide sequence AGGTCA separated by one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> and are therefore referred to as a DR-1
          response element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARγ</ENAMEX> play critical
          roles in the catabolism and storage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX>, whereas the
          function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARδ</ENAMEX> is less certain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX> is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominant PPAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, as confirmed
          presently. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX> were not likely
          expressed in the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, as negative values were
          obtained with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> software. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX> is reported
          to regulate genes involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> transport, synthesis and
          oxidation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid metabolism, ketogenesis and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Δ5, Δ6</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ9</NUMEX>-desaturation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          In spite of dramatic differences in the expression of
          a variety of PPAR-responsive genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> gene expression
          itself was quite constant in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> analyzed, as
          previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . This constancy of PPAR
          expression indicates that differences in the
          transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPRE</ENAMEX> are likely due
          to the direct activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX>. Feeding our diets

          previously found to be induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , but were
          not transcriptionally regulated in the present
          experiment.
          A recent study examined effects of PPARα-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in murine livers using cDNA microarrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          . Despite the different strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> examined
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX>) and the different genomic technology utilized
          for the examination of differentially expressed genes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cDNA microarrays</NUMEX>), several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found
          differentially regulated in both experiments, indicating
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonist and LC-PUFA affect gene expression
          through similar pathways. Genes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cd36</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cyp2b9</TIMEX>,
          Hmgcs2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ech1</ENAMEX> were induced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4</NUMEX>-fold when
          Wy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,643</NUMEX> (a PPARα-specific agonist) was administered to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>. These transcripts were similarly
          regulated in the current study, providing further
          indication that many of the differentially expressed
          genes were likely PPARα-activated.
          Preliminary evidence suggests preferred ligands for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> activation are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C and 20 C FAs</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAs</ENAMEX> shorter
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or longer than 20 C will not fit correctly into
          the PPAR binding pocket and stabilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> helix [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          ] . The net effect would be that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> co-activators are
          not recruited to relax nucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and allow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcription</ENAMEX> machinery to interact with various promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22:6:n3</TIMEX>) may require
          retroconversion via β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">oxidation to an 18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> prior to activating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 33</NUMEX> ] . Without the
          use of purified FA it is difficult to distinguish whether
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> in our fish oil preparation was retroconverted
          since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil also provided the retroconversion
          products, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20:5n3 and 22:5n3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Likewise, AA was
          not provided as a pure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> component making comparisons to
          the control to detect retroconversion difficult. However,
          earlier work clearly shows that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> and AA can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retroconverted</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon shortened intermediates</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBPs</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBPs</ENAMEX> are critically important basic helix-loop helix
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bHLH</NUMEX>) transcription factors activated in response to
          variations in intracellular cholesterol levels that
          induce transcription of genes with sterol regulatory
          element (SRE) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>box containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Within the
          SREBP promoter element, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver X</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXR</ENAMEX>)-responsive elements (LXRE) may have an important
          role [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> may affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX> mediated
          transcription via several mechanisms. One mechanism is to
          antagonize activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LXR</ENAMEX> receptor leading to
          fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LXR/RXR</ENAMEX> heterodimer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to bind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRE</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and less SREBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>-mediated
          transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRE-containing genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The PPARα
          signaling cascade intertwines with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX> pathways since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> also activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX>, which can induce LXRα
          expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          In the present experiment, saturated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> replaced AA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> to equilibrate total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content. Yoshikawa 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] found AA to be more
          potent than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> (saturated and monounsaturated being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ineffective</ENAMEX>) at inhibiting activation of SREBP-1c
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRE</ENAMEX> enhancer constructs, induced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRα</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-β</NUMEX>. An increase in transcription
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> may be associated with increased levels of the
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1 protein</ENAMEX>.
          Numerous hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were
          regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> in the present experiments,
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> itself (consistent with [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] ).
          Also regulated were genes involved in triacylglycerol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gpam</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> synthesis and elongation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Acas1,</ENAMEX>

          speculatively contain an SRE as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> desaturation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Scd1</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gluconeogenesis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pck1</NUMEX>), cytochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p450</ENAMEX> metabolism
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyp4a-10</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-14</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> transport (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cd36</NUMEX>), cholesterol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> and transport (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fpps</ENAMEX>), and ketone body
          formation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mitochondrial Hmgcs2</ENAMEX>). It is evident that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPRE</ENAMEX> have roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> oxidation but
          not FA synthesis, whereas the converse is true for genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing SRE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          Several genes that may contain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acly</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Elovl2 and Cd36</TIMEX>, were found in the
          same cluster. However, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPRE</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          not all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRE-containing genes</ENAMEX> co-clustered, indicating
          that not all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRE-containing genes</ENAMEX> were regulated
          identically by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> diets. Overall, the
          number of regulated genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPREs</ENAMEX> indicates
          the breadth of molecular responses to dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>,
          many of which appear to be co-orchestrated not only by
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcription factors, but by additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> as well.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> was down regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>, but importantly, not affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -1.8*</TIMEX>). Thus, chronic AA feeding alone does not
          appear, in our experiments, to interact with the SREBP-1
          signaling cascade. It is not clear how AA is handled
          differently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> to prevent its interaction with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX>. The probe set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Affymetrix Murine 11</ENAMEX> k chip
          could not differentiate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the -1a and -1c</TIMEX> splicing
          variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX>. There was however high sequence
          identity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX>) between the probe set sequence and rat
          ADD1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>, the murine homologue of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c/ADD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> regulates transcription of genes
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> biosynthesis and desaturation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX>, in addition to interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREs</ENAMEX>, binds
          E-box containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . E-box containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were not examined so the current data analysis
          could have underestimated SREBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-linked effects. Some
          E-box or bHLH binding factors activate the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX>. For example, both upstream stimulating factor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USF</ENAMEX>; an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>box binding factor) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX> bind the FA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasn</ENAMEX>) E-box [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Usf2</ENAMEX> transcription
          was significantly down regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, but not
          affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> or the combination diet using
          microarrays, but this result could not fully be confirmed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-5.6*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> with microarray; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.1</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y transcription factor adds further complexity
          to transcriptional regulation since it can interact and
          modulate the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1c</ENAMEX> target genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing Y</ENAMEX>-box motifs, such as those found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fasn</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          ] . Mutating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y binding site in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fasn</ENAMEX> relieved
          LC-PUFA-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fasn</ENAMEX> down regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Nfyb was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed after dietary LC-PUFA addition
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>). Although no significant changes were
          observed between dietary treatments and control diet, a
          significant difference was observed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH diets</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> could have induced a joint

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hepatic</ENAMEX> nuclear factors have been recognized to be
          transcription factors mediating the transcription of a
          variety of genes putatively involved in energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNFs</ENAMEX> may compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> for binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DR-1</ENAMEX> elements. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> can activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα/RXRα</ENAMEX>,
          leading to displacement of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HNF4α</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPRE</ENAMEX>; or be
          converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CoA</ENAMEX> derivatives, which in turn can suppress
          HNF4α transcriptional activity. Alternatively, these
          transcription factors may respond differently to chronic
          versus acute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>.
          Hnf4α was not differentially regulated in the current
          experiment. The related transcription factor HNF3γ
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">winged helix protein</ENAMEX>, fork <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Foxa3</TIMEX>) was however down
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">regulated -2.0</ENAMEX>* fold with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>, but not with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>. HNF3γ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may be involved in
          etiology of obesity, hyperlipidemia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, by
          regulating glucagon transcription, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance,
          and pancreatic γ cell function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . To our
          knowledge, the regulation of hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HNF3γ</ENAMEX> expression by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> has not been previously reported.
          HNF3γ-signaling may regulate transcription of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pck1</TIMEX> (up
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">regulated ca. 2</ENAMEX>* fold with each diet, presently), and
          G6pc (differentially regulated in the current experiment)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . HNF3γ is also reported to increase transcription
          of several genes that were not differentially regulated
          in the present experiment including, transferrin,
          tyrosine amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transferase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IPF-1/PDX-1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
        
          Hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> synthesis
          In the cytoplasm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> synthesis is controlled via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acly</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetyl CoA</ENAMEX> carboxylase (ACC), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasn</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acly</ENAMEX> reaction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhances FA</ENAMEX> synthesis by providing more acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX> substrates and enhancing ACC activity. The malonyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> generated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACC</ENAMEX> reaction then inhibits FA
          oxidation by reversibly inhibiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpt1</TIMEX>.
          It has previously been shown that the Acly gene in
          human cultured hepatic cells has a regulatory region from
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-49</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flanking region similar to that of
          Fasn, which is responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
          In the present experiment, there was coordinated down
          regulation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acly</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between -1.8* and -8.9*</TIMEX> fold
          regulation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>) and Fasn
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>*, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.3</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-5.4*</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> were not statistically
          significant from one another, but each was significantly
          different with the combination diet). It is intriguing
          that, in general, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasn</ENAMEX> were more strongly
          down regulated with the combination diet than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>. This synergy represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> of
          the many unexpected findings revealed with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptomic</ENAMEX> approach. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACC</ENAMEX> was not regulated
          at the transcriptional level, cytoplasmic citrate
          (generated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acly</ENAMEX> reaction) is an allosteric
          activator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACC</ENAMEX>, so less cytoplasmic citrate would lead
          to less activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Transcript levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatic acetyl CoA</ENAMEX> synthetase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMP</ENAMEX> forming (acetate:CoA
          ligase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMP</ENAMEX> forming; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acas1</ENAMEX>) were consistently down
          regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -1.7*, -4.4*</TIMEX>). This enzyme
          typically has specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-3 C FA</ENAMEX> chain lengths. In
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, intestine, adipose, and mammary gland, the
          cytoplasmic form synthesizes acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> for lipogenesis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] . It is regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SREBP-1a</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-1c</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>, as well
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP3</ENAMEX> binding to GC-boxes; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> also
          contains an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>box [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . It is down regulated with
          fasting, and induced with re-feeding; such dietary
          regulation does not exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ]
          . More generally, acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> synthase is reported to be
          PPARα-activated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . The observed down regulation is
          consistent with less acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CoA</ENAMEX> available for the ACC
          reaction, as well as a plethora of other reactions.
          Overall, it is plausible that both <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FUNG and FISH feeding</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decreased FA</ENAMEX> synthesis in the current experiment.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatic FA</ENAMEX> oxidaton
          As described above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acly</ENAMEX> expression (and possibly ACC
          activity) was significantly down regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFAs</ENAMEX>,
          likely leading to less FA synthesis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malonyl CoA</ENAMEX> inhibits
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> oxidation by reversibly inhibiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpt1</TIMEX>. Cpt1
          transfers acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> to carnitine in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermembrane</ENAMEX> space of the inner mitochondrial membrane,
          and has a regulatory role in controlling hepatic
          β-oxidation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Cpt2 transfers carnitinoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> in the mitochondrial matrix for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-oxidation</NUMEX>.
          Carnitine acetyltransferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crat</ENAMEX>) may have the same role
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPT2</ENAMEX>, but with specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-10 C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitochondrial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpt1</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.8*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.7*</TIMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpt2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.9*</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.7*</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crat</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3.3*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>) were all up regulated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> were not identical in this
          regard. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crat</ENAMEX> expression was significantly up
          regulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>* fold with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FISH</ENAMEX> treatment, but was less
          effected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX> and the combination diet.
          Acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase catalyzes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step
          in mitochondrial β-oxidation, converting acyl-CoA to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-trans-enoyl CoA.</ENAMEX> Isoforms with specificity for short,
          medium, and long chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> exist. Medium-chain
          acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadm</ENAMEX>) was up regulated,
          particularly with the combination diet (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.7*</TIMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dienoyl CoA</ENAMEX> isomerase (also known as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Δ3,5 Δ2,4 dienoyl</NUMEX>
          CoA isomerase; Ech1 transcripts) converts double bonds to
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> bonds during β-oxidation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>. Ech1 was significantly up regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>
          alone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.6*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>), consistent with the need to
          isomerize numerous double bonds during β-oxidation. It is
          not clear why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> did not also up regulate transcripts,
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> are generally reported to up regulate this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isomerase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . The present data generally suggest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> oxidation by down regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acly</ENAMEX>;
          and up regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpt-1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ech1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadm</ENAMEX>. However,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> did not affect regulation of
          these transcripts identically.
        
        
          Hepatic carbohydrate metabolism
          Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pck1</NUMEX>) is the
          rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis, and most of its
          activity is regulated transcriptionally. Feeding of all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diets</ENAMEX> led to an increase in hepatic Pck1
          transcription, indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gluconeogenesis</ENAMEX> was favored
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">glycolysis</TIMEX>. Specifically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with high
          sequence similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> Pck1 (accession numbers

          differential gene expression for the mouse Pck1

          G6pc converts <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-6 phosphate</ENAMEX> to free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gluconeogenesis</TIMEX>. G6pc was unaffected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>,
          significantly up regulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>* fold with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>
          (consistent with up regulated gluconeogenesis), but down
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">regulated -1.9</ENAMEX>* fold with the combination diet (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.6*, -1.9*</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rat G6pc</ENAMEX> has HNF4α consensus binding sites
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX> hepatoma cells, PUFA
          down regulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G6pc</TIMEX>, possibly via inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNF</ENAMEX> 4α
          promoter activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In our current mouse
          experiment, the transcriptional effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> on
          G6pc may thus have been HNF4α- or PPARα mediated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hepatic</ENAMEX> cAMP signaling/links to carbohydrate
          metabolism
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> is an important signaling molecule that can be
          found in specific cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Levels are
          controlled through synthesis via adenylate cyclase, and
          degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDEs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM-PDEs</ENAMEX>) are sensitive to calmodulin and calcium
          up regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> can then affect cell
          signaling via interactions with the regulatory subunits
          of cAMP activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinases</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase A,
          leading to their subsequent activation, and via binding
          of cAMP response element binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (CREBs) to cAMP

          .
          In the present study, liver <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cam-Pde 1c</ENAMEX> was not
          regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH feeding</ENAMEX> alone, but was
          significantly up regulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>* fold with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CKII; Camk2b</ENAMEX>) was not affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FUNG feeding</ENAMEX> or the
          combination diet, but was significantly down regulated
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX>* fold with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> alone. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CKII</ENAMEX> is a calmodulin target
          in the brain, involved in synaptic plasticity. In the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CKII</ENAMEX> may be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (sensitive
          to apoptosis gene) and phosphorylate it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAG</ENAMEX> in turn has
          a role in preventing oxidation by inhibiting cytochrome c
          release and caspase activation. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CKII</ENAMEX> may
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activate CPT-1</ENAMEX> via cytoskeletal phosphorylation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokeratin</ENAMEX>. Thus, an activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CKII</ENAMEX> may lead to
          increased β-oxidation and antioxidant protection. Feeding

          fold increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hepatic Pck1</TIMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set
          identified.
          Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> may up regulate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pck1</TIMEX>, the

          SREBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- and/or PPAR-signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . This has the
          overall effect of limiting fat accumulation and shunting
          metabolic flux to gluconeogenesis. In a molecular sense,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH feeding mimics</ENAMEX> (or accentuates) the fasted

          Hepatic desaturation of LC-PUFA
          As previously noted, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCD-1</ENAMEX> is an important enzyme
          whose transcription is mediated by both PPAR- and
          SREBP-mediated signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD-1</ENAMEX> introduces 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis</ENAMEX> double bonds at position C9 in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. It has preferred substrate specificity for
          C18:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>, but will also desaturate other saturated chain
          lengths. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> showed a significant down regulation
          of transcripts (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-1.8*</TIMEX> with microarray; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>*,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-2.7*</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>). In this instance, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> indicated no change with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX>; however, RT-PCR
          indicated an up regulation. This may be expected as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> is more sensitive than microarrays. It is
          important to note however, that changes deemed
          significant by the microarray were also confirmed to be
          significant by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, as is the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>
          induced changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Scd1</TIMEX>. The transcriptional changes in
          Scd1 expression were in some cases consistent with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for apparent decreased enzymatic activity, namely
          the ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> in hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PL</ENAMEX> pools with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ9</NUMEX> double
          bond/same FA without a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ9</NUMEX> double bond (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). For
          example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS/PI</ENAMEX> and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the
          ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16:1n7/16</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 and 18:1n9/18</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX> was lowest for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> diet.
        
        
          Hepatic elongation of LC-PUFA
          There are suggestions in the literature that FA
          elongation may also be controlled by transcription factor
          signaling. The elongase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Elovl2</ENAMEX> may contain an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRE</ENAMEX>, and
          therefore be under the transcriptional control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] ). Due to observations in the metabolite data, which
          suggests a repression of elongase activity, the dietary
          regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Elovl2 and Elovl3</TIMEX> was focused on.
          Changes in genes with known elongase activity were
          examined. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast gene Elo1</ENAMEX> is associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongating FAs</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 to 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>; yet, this activity is
          often masked by cytosolic FA synthase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] .
          Evidence shows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Elovl2 elongates FA</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24C</NUMEX>; and Elovl3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongates FA</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26C</TIMEX>, with preference for converting FA
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 24C</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26C</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
          The probe set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Elovl2</TIMEX> was down regulated,
          particularly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> and the combined diet (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -1.8*</TIMEX>), consistent with some of the lipid data
          described below; whereas the probe set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Elovl3</TIMEX> was not
          affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>, up regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and down
          regulated, although not significantly, with the
          combination diet (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.9*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.6</NUMEX>). An NCBI BLAST search
          identified the murine homologue of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> ELO2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Elovl2</NUMEX>) to
          be Ssc2 (Sequence similarity to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cig30</NUMEX>), predominating in
          liver and testes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] ; complementation studies in
          yeast mutants indicated the functional equivalent of ELO3
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Elovl3</NUMEX>) is Ssc1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Substrates of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ssc2</ENAMEX> were
          AA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> was not tested) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH feeding</ENAMEX> may transcriptionally regulate their
          subsequent conversion to elongated products.
          Our metabolic data showed evidence that elongase
          activities may have been altered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> feeding.
          There was reduced conversion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> to 16C <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> following
          LC-PUFA feeding. Specifically, the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C18</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0/16</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylcholine</ENAMEX> (PC), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS/PI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> and ether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> was
          decreased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18:1n7/16</NUMEX>:1n7
          in sphingomyelin was decreased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>; in
          PC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> only FUNG feeding decreased the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18:1n7/16</NUMEX>:1n7 ratio. There was also possible reduced
          conversion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20C</NUMEX> to 22C <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">22C</ENAMEX> to 24C <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX>. The
          ratios of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24:0/22:0</TIMEX> in sphingomyelin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PS/PI</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24:1n9/22</NUMEX>:1n9 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS/PI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22:4n6/20</NUMEX>:4n6 in PC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22:5n3/20</NUMEX>:5n3 in PC and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>, were all reduced
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX> had either a neutral effect or
          partly reversed effects seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> (with exception of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24:1n9/22</NUMEX>:1n9 ratio).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatic Lipid Transport</ENAMEX> of FAs
          Transcription factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBPs</ENAMEX> are
          also known to have an effect on various lipid transport
          genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Abca1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Abca7 and Abce1</TIMEX> were differentially
          regulated; however, their roles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> are not
          precisely known. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cassette</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>) superfamily, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Abca1</ENAMEX>, are induced
          via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARγ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXRα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . Abca1 has been
          shown to play a role in reverse cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> and
          may be linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> deficiency in metabolic syndromes [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> ] . In macrophages, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18:2n6</TIMEX> and AA increased ABCA1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein degradation</ENAMEX> without affecting transcriptional
          levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . In the current study, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Abca1</TIMEX> was
          significantly decreased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> translocase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cd36</NUMEX>) was significantly up regulated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> alone (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.4*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.5</NUMEX>). Cd36 co-clustered
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-FABP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Apoe</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apoc1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Abce1</ENAMEX> transcript, all
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> and sterol transport. CD36 protein
          mediates long chain free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> uptake in adipocytes and
          other tissues, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. In murine pre-adipocytes,
          it is transcriptionally up regulated by long chain free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FAs</ENAMEX> via a PPARα-mediated process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Approaches
          using antisense technology, null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          and microarrays revealed important additional roles of
          CD36 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for thrombospondin, collagen
          type I, and oxidized LDL on macrophages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . The up
          regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cd36</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and antagonism in presence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX>, merits further study.
          FA binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (FABPs) are small cytosolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with virtually identical backbone structures
          that facilitate the solubility and intracellular

          organs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] , but it has been most studied in psoriatic
          skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] where it has putative roles in FA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> transport, skin barrier function and
          keratinocyte differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] . Although links
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-FABP</ENAMEX> have not currently been
          identified, this gene clustered with other known
          PPAR-affected genes suggesting a possibly important
          regulatory link. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-FABP</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fold higher

          studied) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . Herein, hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-FABP</ENAMEX> expression
          (Fabp5 transcript) was down regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> diets
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -8.4*, -13.6*</TIMEX> with microarray; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2.9</NUMEX>*, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-8.5*</TIMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.4</NUMEX>* with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>;). The significance of this large
          decrease in hepatic expression by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and
          particularly the combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, is a potentially
          important finding whose physiological consequence must be
          further investigated. Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> induces the same
          decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fabp5</TIMEX> in psoriatic skin is not known to our
          knowledge. N3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX>, particularly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20:5n3</TIMEX>, are known to
          be of clinical benefit in treating psoriasis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> ] .

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitochondrial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hmgcs2</ENAMEX>, which is involved in

          with hepatocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72 73</NUMEX> ] . The cytosolic form involved
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol biosynthesis</ENAMEX> was not affected. Fpps was
          consistently down regulated (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -1.6*, -1.9*</TIMEX>) across
          diets, which could lead to reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> synthesis;

          LC-PUFA altered expression of various apolipoproteins.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apolipoprotein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Apoc1</NUMEX>) was only down regulated with

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apoe and Apoc1</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apoa4 and Apoc2</TIMEX>, were similarly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed/co-clustered across diets. When clustered
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the more general "transport" category,
          categories of co-expressed genes with underlying roles in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipid</ENAMEX> and sterol transport were evident. For example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apoc1</ENAMEX> co-clustered with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Abce1 and Cd36</TIMEX>; and
          Apoa4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apoc2</ENAMEX> co-clustered with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Abca1 and Fabp5</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> alone moderately down regulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apoa4</TIMEX>,
          whereas the combination diet resulted in a large down
          regulation (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -3.2*, -17.2*</TIMEX> with microarray; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.3</NUMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-4.9*</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>). A similar trend was seen for
          Apoa4 precursor transcript (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*, -4.2*, -9.7*</TIMEX>). ApoAIV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-atherogenic</ENAMEX> component of high-density
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (HDL) particles and is also found in very
          low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> and chylomicrons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] . It is
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> absorption; low-density
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) clearance as a cofactor for hepatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipase</ENAMEX>; increasing dolichol acylation; and increasing PE,
          but not PC, hydrolysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> may decrease Apoa4
          expression through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76 77</NUMEX> ] , and in the current
          experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> may have affected PPARα
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transactivation</ENAMEX> and signaling. ApoAIV activity could also
          be affected by diet induced structural changes to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane PL</ENAMEX> in lipoprotein particles, as Apoa4
          intercalates with PC in model membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] . The
          biological consequences of reduced Apoa4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>,
          particularly with the combination diet, merits further
          investigation. Rodents fed low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol diets</ENAMEX>, as in
          the present study, carry most of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> in the
          HDL fraction, and under these conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil
          feeding reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> from the HDL fraction, so the
          above mentioned changes in apolipoproteins, although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascinating</ENAMEX>, must be interpreted within the context of
          the chosen models.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>-mediated effects in the
          Hippocampus
          In the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed
          genes were identified in the hippocampus using a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> LFC
          model. The trend in the data was similar to that seen
          with liver data, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods for details). These data revealed that the
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dietary oils</ENAMEX> led to differences in the
          expression of a broad range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hippocampal genes</ENAMEX> that
          have been previously indicated to be involved in cell
          signaling and signal transduction, including cation
          transport, calcium binding, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>- and GTP-binding as revealed by
          examining GO identifiers across all of the diet-regulated
          genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In striking contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, a
          number of hippocampal LC-PUFA-induced differentially
          expressed genes had annotations suggesting immune related
          functions, as well as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense</ENAMEX> responses specific
          to the hippocampus, including: "MHC-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          lymphocyte antigens, immunoglobulins, and defense
          response." Additionally, there were numerous ontological
          assignments for genes which suggested dietary LC-PUFA
          feeding affected cell cycle control including the
          following categories: "cytoskeleton, cell cycle control,
          and cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>".
          In the hippocampus, dietary LC-PUFA activated a
          different set of transcription factors than observed in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, including: nuclear factor of κ light chain
          gene enhancer in B cells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> p105 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Nfkb1</NUMEX>); nescient helix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">loop helix 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Nhlh1</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> transcription factor 3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2f3</NUMEX>);
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription factor 3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Btf3</NUMEX>); inhibitor of DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binding 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Idb1</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> site albumin promoter binding protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dbp</ENAMEX>); paired box gene 9 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pax9</NUMEX>); and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ELK1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          the ETS oncogene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Although dietary LC-PUFA
          activated numerous transcriptional factors in both liver
          and hippocampus, it is a noteworthy difference that the
          transcriptional signatures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SREBP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNF</ENAMEX> could
          not be detected in the hippocampal dataset.
          The interpretation of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX> hippocampal transcripts
          is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but all
          raw data is deposited at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> gene expression Omnibus
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] . The present data provides evidence that LC-PUFA
          were incorporated into brain and hippocampal tissues (as
          previously discussed) and thereby influenced novel
          signaling pathways via receptor interactions. Some of
          these signaling pathways are highlighted below.
        
        
          Hippocampal signaling pathways affected by dietary
          LC-PUFA
          
            Transthyretin signaling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thyroid hormones</ENAMEX> including transthyretin are
            generally involved in neuronal proliferation and
            differentiation, and are required for normal
            cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transthyretin</ENAMEX> is specifically
            involved in transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thyroxine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T4</NUMEX>) and
            retinol-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in cerebrospinal fluid and
            brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum</ENAMEX>. AA has been found to bind transthyretin
            and inhibit thyroxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> ] .
            Transthyretin may also sequester β amyloid, thereby
            having neuroprotective properties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dietary FISH</ENAMEX> had the
            effect of decreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ttr</ENAMEX>; whereas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX> and
            particularly the combination diet, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ttr</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX>,
            -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>*, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.2*</TIMEX>). Similar to our findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, feeding
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats fish</ENAMEX> oil significantly decreased Ttr expression in
            whole brain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX> fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, feeding of
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginkgo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biloba</ENAMEX> extract (publicized
            to affect mental function) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> increased
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampal Ttr</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX> ] . Levels of transthyretin, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> of transthyretin with thyroxine and
            retinol-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> should be assessed in future
            LC-PUFA feeding experiments.
          
          
            5-hydroxytryptamine signaling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dietary LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> may affect 5-hydroxytryptamine
            (serotonin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT) signaling. Specifically, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -acylethanolamine can displace
            binding of ligands to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> ] , and

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> receptor currents [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX> ] , and we
            have previously reported that dietary AA feeding
            increased whole brain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acylethanolamine</ENAMEX>, as a
            separate component of the present work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> ] . In the
            present work, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dietary FUNG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, alone or together,
            increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Htr4 receptor</ENAMEX> levels (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6.5*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT

            hippocampal acetylcholine outflow, thereby affecting
            cognitive processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,8</NUMEX>-sialyltransferase
            Hippocampal α-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,8</NUMEX>-sialyltransferase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Siat8e</NUMEX>) was
            down regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> and the combination diet, but
            not with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FUNG</ENAMEX>; difference relative to control was only
            significant for the combination diet (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2.6</NUMEX>,
            -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX>*). Hippocampal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cδ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prkcd</ENAMEX>) was
            slightly down regulated with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> diets
            (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.3</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-1.8*</TIMEX>). PUFA feeding can influence PKC
            activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> ] and one mechanism of action may be via
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diacylglycerol molecular species</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,8</NUMEX>-linked disialic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> are found in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoproteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> ] . During learning, there is a
            transient increase in neuronal polysialyation in the
            dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This has been
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with selective retention and/or elimination
            of synapses that are transiently overproduced during
            memory consolidation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hippocampus</ENAMEX>,
            during development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCδ</ENAMEX> can negatively regulate
            polysialyltransferase activity and neural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX> (NCAM) polysialylation state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAM</ENAMEX> is
            implicated in neural differentiation and cellular
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasticity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> ] . Our observed decrease in Prkcd
            expression may have affected hippocampal
            polysialyltransferase activity. It is not known if
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prkcd</ENAMEX> regulates expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siat8e</TIMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proopiomelanocortin</ENAMEX> (POMC)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> is a hypothalamic neuropeptide, and a target
            for leptin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> is cleaved post-translationally
            producing bioactive peptides (adrenocorticotrophin,
            β-endorphin and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β- and γ-melanocyte</NUMEX> stimulating
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hormones</ENAMEX>) that interact with neurons expressing
            melanocortin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, leading to appetite suppression
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> ] . Feeding high fat diets is known to increase
            Pomc expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92</TIMEX> ] . Herein, FUNG feeding resulted
            in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>* fold increase in hippocampal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pomc</ENAMEX>, whereas
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> and the combination diet had smaller,
            non-statistically significant effects (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6.0*</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>).
            The physiological effect of potentially increasing POMC
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FUNG feeding</ENAMEX> is not known. As a next step,
            levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POMC protein</ENAMEX> and downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> peptides
            should be quantified
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions and key findings
        The molecular effects of dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil fed in
        reasonable quantities over prolonged periods has been found
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to be related to alterations in
        health outcome. In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were fed
        relevant quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil and AA rich fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> and
        the responses were studied in murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and hippocampus
        using a combined gene expression- and lipid-profiling
        strategy. The simple addition of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> to the habitual
        diet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> influenced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, in a striking number of examples, inter-diet
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">FUNG vs. FISH vs. FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX>) and inter-organ differences
        in the transcriptional profile were observed, indicating
        that the predominant bioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAs</ENAMEX> in fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20:5n3</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22:5n3 and 22:6n3</TIMEX>) and AA enriched fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:4n6) do
        not affect gene transcription identically in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs
        studied.
        Hepatic gene transcriptional profiles and ontology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classifications</ENAMEX> indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil LC-PUFA likely
        increased FA β-oxidation and gluconeogenesis, and decreased
        FA synthesis. Furthermore, the transcriptional profile
        observed indicated that these LC-PUFA regulated hepatic
        energy processes through the tight coordination of several
        critical transcriptional factors. Feeding both LC-PUFA
        containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils mimicked</ENAMEX> (or accentuated) the fasted
        metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, confirming this aspect of the beneficial
        health effects of dietary LC-PUFA for both normal and
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and even household <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>.
        These same conclusions regarding energy expenditure were
        reached in experiments assessing enzymatic activities, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> changes in rat liver using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots,
        where fish oil feeding: increased palmitoyl CoA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> and peroxisomal oxidation rate; increased
        Cpt1, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cpt2, Δ 3, Δ 2-enoyl CoA</ENAMEX> isomerase, and Ech1
        expression and activity; and decreased expression and
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> synthase, malic enzyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glucose 6-phosphate</ENAMEX>
        dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, compared to palm and/or
        safflower oil feeding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93</TIMEX> ] . Likewise, in rat white
        retroperitoneal adipose tissue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> oil feeding also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreased Fasn</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone leptin</ENAMEX>, which also acts through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX>,
        affected many transcripts similarly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> ( 
        e.g. , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">leptin</ENAMEX> decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gpam</ENAMEX> and
        Apoa4 transcripts; and up regulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ech1</TIMEX>, mitochondrial
        Hmgcs2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyp4a14</ENAMEX> transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> ] .
        Chronic feeding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and AA-enriched fungal oils
        broadly affected genes regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARα</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNFα</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SREBP-1</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>; transcription factors implicated in
        lipid metabolism as well as other processes. Only with
        future studies in which PPAR-specific agonists and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are included, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>,
        will the precise role of PPAR-signaling in response to
        LC-PUFA feeding be elucidated. The overlapping
        actions/effects of these various transcription factors
        present a challenge that will require tools, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomics</ENAMEX> and metabolomics, to provide a stepping stone
        towards the complete understanding of LC-PUFA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>.
        There were striking differences in the genes and
        transcriptional factors activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> in the liver
        and hippocampus, despite these organs being metabolically
        linked, as AA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> cross the blood brain barrier. There
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> reasons for these inter-organ
        differences. Firstly, the dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAs</ENAMEX> were not identically
        incorporated into both tissues, as indicated by tissue
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">profiling</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, different transcription factors
        exist and were activated in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs, which would
        affect downstream signaling. Thirdly, there is the
        possibility, that even when the same transcription factors
        were activated in both organs, factors including
        dimerization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, multiple binding of various
        transcription factors, post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> modifications,
        and signaling kinetics could affect the transcriptional
        profile.
        Currently, nutritional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> recommendations are made
        largely by examining levels of key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> in plasma; and
        less often, red blood cells, platelets, and biopsied
        tissue. Transcriptional gene profiles have not been
        considered in making such recommendations. The present work
        convincingly shows the potential importance of examining
        transcriptional profiles in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> profiles; and
        the importance of examining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> tissue, in making
        such LC-PUFA nutritional and clinical recommendations.

          was created for comparison against the control.
          Hippocampal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared as described above for

            diets, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 </NUMEX>g pooled total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was the starting material
            for hybridization to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mu11kA & B GeneChips</ENAMEX>.
            Pooled liver controls were evaluated in duplicate on

            Selection of differentially regulated genes and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis
            A mathematical method was developed and applied to
            the raw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> data for the selection of
            differentially regulated genes. This method moves
            beyond setting a single fold change cut-off by
            considering fold change in the context of absolute
            expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In brief, this method includes: (A)
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of fold changes
            within narrow bins of absolute expression levels to
            determine a limit fold change (LFC) function; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)
            subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold
            change/absolute difference calculation. Herein,
            absolute expression is referred to as average
            difference intensity (ADI) in all mathematical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equations</ENAMEX>. The function describing the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampal</ENAMEX> and liver data was described with the
            following equations: LFC 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippocampus</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.36</NUMEX> + (90/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>);
            and LFC 
            liver = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.52</NUMEX>+(100/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>),
            respectively.
            The selection of differentially expressed genes was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corroborated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver samples</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            assessing the measurement variability and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) assessing
            individual mouse variability in order to establish
            confidence intervals with which to calculate the
            significance of differences with pooled diet response
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) confirmation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> for a
            sub-selection of genes. Replicate analysis established
            that all genes selected by this method also laid above
            a more conventional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> confidence interval, when
            compared to the variation of pooled replicates ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Subsequent analysis of
            the variation between individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) indicated that this
            variation is comparable to the pooled variation and
            that all genes selected as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed
            lied above the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.0%</NUMEX> confidence interval for individual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse variability</ENAMEX>. The gene expression means of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were calculated and compared to
            pooled data in a scatter plot. A correlation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-efficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX> was obtained indicating that the
            pools are accurate representations of the individual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> used to create them. Lastly, validation studies
            showed up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7%</NUMEX> concordance of microarray data with
            real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) across the
            range of absolute expression for specific genes
            selected as differentially regulated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . All
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data, including information about the low false
            positive rate, for all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver samples</ENAMEX> mentioned
            in the present work, can be found in the aforementioned
            reference.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> LFC method indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">513</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">489</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> were
            differentially regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC-PUFA</ENAMEX> from the original
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represented on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Mu11K</TIMEX> Affymetrix
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX>. Absence/presence calls were not considered 
            a priori in selecting
            significantly regulated genes, but were a
            post-selection criterion. After removing those genes
            that were identified as 
            absent across all dietary
            conditions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX> hippocampal and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">329</NUMEX> hepatic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed probe sets remained in the
            list for further analysis and interpretation. Of these,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221 and 214</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represented annotated sequences in
            the hippocampus and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, respectively.
            Fold changes are always listed in the respective
            order: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FUNG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FUNG+FISH</ENAMEX> without repeating
            these labels; and negative signs indicate down
            regulation. To determine if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> for a treatment
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was significantly different from the control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> LFC best-fit equations were utilized: LFC 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippocampus</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.36</NUMEX> + (90/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>);
            LFC 
            liver = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.52</NUMEX>+(100/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups</ENAMEX>
            significantly different from the control, as determined
            by a pair-wise comparison, are labeled with an asterisk
            in the text and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The mathematical model
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX> also selected some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> due to significant
            differences between experimental treatments, even when
            no significant differences versus the control were
            observed. For reasons of simplicity, significant
            differences between experimental treatments are not
            indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, but are discussed in the
            text.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
            Selected genes were grouped by expression patterns
            through a combined 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -means and hierarchical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> approach (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spotfire, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sommerville, MA</ENAMEX>)
            by setting the maximum number of clusters in either
            method to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> (a compromise between not having too many
            or too few clusters) and then graphing on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2-D</NUMEX> gene
            plot (Figures not shown; hierarchical cluster numbers
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h1-h5</ENAMEX>), and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -means cluster number (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">k1-5</ENAMEX>)
            included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Genes were then annotated using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) classifications; a dynamic,
            structured, yet precisely defined system which
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">characterizes genes</ENAMEX> based on defined categories of
            molecular function, biological process, and cellular
            component [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were assigned names
            through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI Locuslink</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Confirmation</ENAMEX>
            A subset of the genes selected by the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model
            were examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR</ENAMEX> ®green dye
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>) which interacts with double-stranded
            nucleotide sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> represented means of
            triplicates for each experimental treatment using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pooled RNA samples</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Amplification was
            performed using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ABI 5700</ENAMEX> machine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) with a hot start at

            15 s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> for denaturation, annealing and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> was normalized to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-actin</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX>,
            which were not statistically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test (α = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) was used to

            following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Lipid analysis
