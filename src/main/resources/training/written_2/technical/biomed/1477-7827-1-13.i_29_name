        Estrogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> regulate cellular function in a wide
        variety of tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . During human pregnancy, the
        production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-beta-estradiol (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2</NUMEX>) rises eighty fold,
        from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.75 nM preovulatory</NUMEX> peak to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> nM at term [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ]
        , and estrogens influence various aspects of placental
        function and fetal development in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and primates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Several previous studies have shown that
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placenta binds estradiol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, more
        recent immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded or
        snap frozen sections as well as other techniques (RT-PCR
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-alpha mRNA) failed to demonstrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX> (ERÎ±) in human placentae during pregnancy or in
        cultures of dispersed placental cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . However,
        it has been indicated that the failure to detect the ERÎ±
        does not entirely preclude the presence of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in
        human trophoblast cells, but might be attributed to a
        relatively low number and density of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> molecules on these
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billiar et al.</ENAMEX> reported
        identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in the nuclei of cultured human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placental syncytiotrophoblast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . To our knowledge, no
        western blot analysis of placental ERÎ± expression has been
        previously described.
        During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> trimester, and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34-36 weeks</TIMEX> of
        pregnancy in particular, the placenta may develop an
        abnormality, often classified as placental aging [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . These abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placentae</ENAMEX> are characterized by
        generalized interstitial fibrosis and fibrinoid
        degeneration of villous stroma, and are associated with
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and congestion of villous sinusoids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Immunohistochemically, villous abnormality is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with progressive diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-1
        differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the villous core [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Marked
        changes in villous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are particularly associated
        with advanced maternal age [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . We have recently
        reported that, with respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> expression,
        compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids, and placental
        expression of low molecular weight cyclin E variants, the
        term placentae can be classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> placental types
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PT1-PT4</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PT4</NUMEX> corresponds to the most severe
        placental abnormality. These observations indicate that the
        term placenta is not a constant structure, either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologically</ENAMEX> or biologically. Therefore, expression of
        certain placental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, may vary.
        Upon immunohistochemical staining, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> is predominantly
        localized to cell nuclei. However, positive staining of ERÎ±
        in the cytoplasm can also be seen [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . It has
        been reported that cytoplasmic ERÎ± expression accompanied
        by a lack of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> is characteristic for
        immature cells, nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> indicates differentiating
        cells, and complete lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression accompanies
        terminal differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen-sensitive cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        . In addition, evidence for cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression has
        been recently presented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are usually separated and grown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenol red</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenol</ENAMEX> red is a
        weak estrogen with apparent biological effects, and the ERÎ±
        binding affinity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco's Modified Eagle</ENAMEX>'s Medium
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX>) is equivalent to levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2 as high as 0.45 nM</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] . Although relatively low when compared to the E2
        levels in pregnancy, this estrogenic binding affinity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX> is close to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preovulatory</TIMEX> peak [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, we included studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX>+, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PhR-/E2-</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PhR-/E2</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> in order to determine the effect of
        estrogens on differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation) derived from normal and abnormal
        placental types.
        Here we show for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        expressed in normal and marginally abnormal placentae
        (normal placental types) but barely detectable in placentae
        exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality (abnormal
        placental types). However, all placental types showed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in trophoblast cultures. Nuclear
        ERÎ± expression was confined to the villous and tissue
        culture mononucleated trophoblast cells, but not
        syncytiotrophoblast layers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX> stimulated
        differentiation of trophoblast cells from normal placental
        types, but mid-pregnancy levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E2</ENAMEX> significantly
        enhanced differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells
        derived from both normal and abnormal placentae.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Tissues
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> placentae from deliveries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 33 and 41 weeks</TIMEX>
          of pregnancy were investigated. The source of placental
          tissue were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with normal and abnormal pregnancies
          admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Tennessee Medical Center</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> additional cases were studied for the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> on
          trophoblast differentiation. Excluded were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          blood transferable infections, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>,
          and apparent ascendent placental infections. Frozen
          tissue samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> (a tissue control for
          ERÎ± expression) were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI Cooperative Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Network</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>. MCF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> breast carcinoma
          cells were maintained as indicated previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] ,
          and utilized as a cell culture positive control. Rat
          kidneys for secondary antibody absorption were kindly
          supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Dominguez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratory of Biology</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproduction, Facultad de Estudios</ENAMEX> Profesionales
          Zaragoza, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> DF, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. The study was approved
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>.
          An unusually detailed description of the methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilized</ENAMEX> follows, since placental ERÎ± expression is still
          a highly controversial issue.
        
        
          Tissue processing and peroxidase
          immunohistochemistry
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, except where specified otherwise, were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO. The</ENAMEX>
          processing of the placenta started within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 min</TIMEX> after
          delivery. Several <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Ã— 10 Ã—</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> mm blocks of tissue were
          collected from different central cotyledons into cryomold
          biopsy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vinyl specimens molds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tissue-Tek Cryomold Biopsy</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miles Inc. Diagnostic Division</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elkhart</ENAMEX>, IN) and embedded
          in an optimum cutting temperature formulation of
          watersoluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycols</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.C.T.</ENAMEX> compound; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molds</ENAMEX> with specimens were frozen by floating on
          liquid nitrogen and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-80Â°C until</TIMEX> use. Frozen
          tissues were sliced into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Î¼m serial sections using a
          cryostat microtome with specimen retraction during return
          travel (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Zeiss Microm</ENAMEX> HM <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E; MICROM LaborgerÃ</ENAMEX>¤te
          GmbH, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waldorf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to twelve distinct tissue
          sections were placed on each slide. The slides were dried
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">~2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">h</ENAMEX> at room temperature, fixed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min in acetone, dried
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C until</TIMEX> immunoperoxidase staining
          was performed - within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to four weeks</TIMEX>. Prior to
          staining, the slides were transferred in a cold room
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4Â°C</NUMEX>) into air protected boxes containing Drierite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granules</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.A. Hammond Drierite Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenia, OH</ENAMEX>) to
          prevent water condensation, and the boxes with slides
          were equilibrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature before opening.
          Slides were incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4Â°C</NUMEX>) with affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purified</ENAMEX> mouse anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ± alpha monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clone h-151</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was raised
          against a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> residue synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX> (RAANLWPSPLMIKR)
          based on the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 287-300</ENAMEX>),
          and reacts specifically with the activated 4S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> alpha
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StressGen Biotechnologies Corp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, BC).
          Another set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> was similarly incubated with
          anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ± monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX> (ready to use without
          additional dilution), clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ID5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO Corporation</ENAMEX>,
          Carpinteria, CA). As indicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>, this antibody
          reacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> terminal domain (A/B region) of the ERÎ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> concentration is unknown (not
          disclosed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX> upon request). In immunoblotting, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibody</ENAMEX> reacts with the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kDa polypeptide chain
          obtained by transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and transfection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> cells with plasmid vectors expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ]
          .
          We also used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monoclonal</ENAMEX> mouse anti-human Thy-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:100</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F15-42-01</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] (Dr.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosemarie Dalchau</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Child Health</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>), for the
          determination of placental type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT1-PT4</ENAMEX>, see below).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> consisted of substitution of primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, or with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> diluted (recommended by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>) anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD3 monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX>, which is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD3 pan T</ENAMEX> cell marker (DAKO). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was also used, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD3</TIMEX> antibody
          specifically stains rare fetal T cells in the placental
          villi only, but not other villous structures.
          After several washes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (room temperature), the
          sections were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peroxidase</ENAMEX> labeled secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> - goat anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgM</ENAMEX>, pre-absorbed with
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Immunoresearch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Grove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>),
          diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> and absorbed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> kidney homogenate as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Tissue sections were processed further
          as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , including hematoxylin
          counterstaining of the nuclei.
          Evaluation was performed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leitz DM RB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leica Inc.</ENAMEX>,

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redmont, WA</ENAMEX>). To obtain figure

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> Â®Power-Point <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Â®97 SR-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX>).
          Each image (including controls) was further copied into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Photo Editor</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corporation</ENAMEX>), and
          total saturation balanced (usually brightness <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>,
          contrast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>) and optimized for peroxidase
          immunohistochemistry by decreasing the image's blue

          (usually to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.83</NUMEX>).
          For the purpose of statistical analysis in this study,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PT1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">placentae</ENAMEX> were coupled, since they can be
          considered as normal placentae capable of responding and
          fulfilling the demands of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> by
          compensatory villous development or expansion of existing
          mature villi [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . They were compared with placental
          types showing moderate and severe abnormality (coupled
          PT3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT4</ENAMEX>).

          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , with some modifications.
          Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical membranes were washed in
          Tris-buffered saline containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tween 20</TIMEX> (TBST) and
          non-specific binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were blocked by immersing the

          diluted to the final concentration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. This
          absorption eliminated any non-specific background. After
          incubation, the membranes were washed <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã— 15 min, 2 Ã— 10</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Ã— 5 min</NUMEX> in fresh changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBST</ENAMEX>, and incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> in blocking buffer at room temperature. Bound

          as recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. For
          exposure (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min, 5 min</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1</NUMEX> h) we used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> XAR

          Next, the membranes were stripped in buffer containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.2 M</ENAMEX> glycine (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>.), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> Tween 20 for

          against other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of interest, e.g., the first
          membrane with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> ID5 (DAKO) and the second

          As indicated above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ID5 antibody</ENAMEX> is delivered ready
          to use for immunohistochemistry, yet the antibody
          concentration is unknown. For western blot analysis we
          diluted the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ID5 antibody</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX>. Although the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ID5</NUMEX> antibody
          identified a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> similar to that detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">h-151</ENAMEX>, the
          staining was weaker (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Therefore, higher ID5
          antibody concentration might be required for optimum
          outcomes in western blot analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX> (IP)
          Cdk2 and rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG IP</ENAMEX> were utilized as negative

          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> control, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of normal rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> was used
          instead of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdk2</NUMEX> rabbit polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation

          Cell separation & culture
          Placental tissue was digested and trophoblast cells
          isolated and cultured as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ,
          with modifications. Since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> digestion yielded
          only erythrocytes and some white blood cells and in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> digestion such cells were accompanied by only rare

          Amnion fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture
          Amnion was carefully separated from the chorion laeve,
          placed into dry petri dishes with epithelium facing the

          The last lane is from an ovarian adenocarcinoma tissue

          Placental types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          During the last trimester of human pregnancy, the
          placenta may exhibit pronounced abnormality associated
          with generalized villous degeneration, often called
          placental aging or senescence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 27 43 44 45</NUMEX> ] .
          We have recently shown that placental abnormality is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> differentiation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein immunostaining</ENAMEX> in the villous core and less or
          more pronounced dilatation of villous sinusoids. Based on
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> criteria, accompanied by changes in the
          expression of cyclin E (cE) low molecular weight protein
          variants, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> basic placental types can be recognized
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT1-PT4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Normal mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">placentae</TIMEX>, placental type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PT1</NUMEX>), show
          strong Thy-1 expression in the villous core, and
          relatively small lumen of sinusoids; expression of cE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> is low. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT1</ENAMEX> can be viewed as placenta
          capable of fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus
          (occasional villous regeneration and expansion of
          existing mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">villi</TIMEX>), without requirement of adaptive
          dilatation of villous sinusoids.
          Marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregularity</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PT2</TIMEX>, is characterized by
          significant diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, and moderate
          but significant dilatation of villous sinusoids. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclin E</ENAMEX>
          expression is highest in this placental type. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT2</ENAMEX> can
          be viewed as placentae with villous and vascular
          adaptation to imminent placental aging (enhanced villous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> and expansion, accompanied by moderate
          dilatation of villous sinusoids).
          Placentae showing further diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-1
          expression and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids
          are classified as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT3</TIMEX>. Cyclin E expression is higher
          compared to PT1 but lower compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT2</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT3</ENAMEX> can be
          viewed as placentae exhibiting advanced aging, capable of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compensating</ENAMEX> demands of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> only by extreme
          dilatation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">villous blood sinusoids</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal villi</ENAMEX> is
          very low, but this is not accompanied by dilatation of
          villous sinusoids. Cyclin E expression varies. The PT4
          can be viewed as placentae exhibiting villous immaturity,
          either compensated by placental hypertrophy (villous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> and expansion without maturation - maternal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT4A</ENAMEX>), or uncompensated (placental
          atrophy associated with villous immaturity - intrauterine
          growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT4B</ENAMEX>) with apparent consequences for
          the newborn. Further details are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Altogether, placental abnormality is not as simple as
          one might imagine, e.g. just placental aging. Table
          1shows that abnormal placentae include either advanced
          placental aging with an excess of villous blood sinusoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PT3</NUMEX>) or severe villous immaturity without
          significant dilatation of villous sinusoids (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PT4</NUMEX>). Again,
          the latter can be either compensated by placental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> (normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apgars</ENAMEX> associated with fetal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrosomia</ENAMEX> in maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT4A</ENAMEX>), or uncompensated
          (placental hypotrophy) and associated with intrauterine
          growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> and apparent deterioration of the
          Apgar scores [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PT4B</NUMEX>).
          Note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1also</ENAMEX> summarizes the data with
          respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression showing either strong
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ± protein</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT1 and PT2</TIMEX>) or only traces
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT3 and PT4</TIMEX>). This supports a view that, regardless of
          pathophysiology, the intensity of in vivo ERÎ± expression
          can be utilized for discrimination between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic
          categories only, the normal (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT1 and PT2</TIMEX>) and the
          abnormal placentae (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT3 and PT4</TIMEX>). Observations
          supporting this view follow. Possible exceptions for PT1
          are indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> in discussion.
        
        
          Placental immunohistochemistry (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          Figures 3Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Bshow</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">h-151</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ID5</ENAMEX> anti-ERÎ±
          antibodies exhibit similar nuclear staining of MCF-7
          cells; no staining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF-7</ENAMEX> culture is apparent with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> antibody recognizing CD3 of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
          The immunoreactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ID5 antibody</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D,
          3E, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-N.</ENAMEX> In normal placentae, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> was strongly
          expressed in cytotrophoblast nuclei (c, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D) lying
          beneath trophoblastic syncytium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>), which showed no
          staining of the nuclei. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Eshows that cytotrophoblast
          cells merging with the syncytium exhibit a diminution of
          ERÎ± expression (compare with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>). Such occasionally
          observed differentiation of cytotrophoblast cells was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with weak cytoplasmic staining of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syncytium</ENAMEX>. Yet the syncytial nuclei never exerted ERÎ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> staining with CD3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F) shows an isolated T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in the
          villous core, but no staining of other villous
          structures. Substitution of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          produced no staining (not shown).
          In addition to cytotrophoblast cells, ERÎ±
          immunoreactivity was also detected in villous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sinusoids</ENAMEX> (v). However, this staining was not associated
          with the nuclei of endothelial cells (black arrows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
          However, cytotrophoblast cells with nuclear ERÎ±
          immunoreactivity were not detected in every placenta
          investigated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Ishows an abnormal placenta with a
          lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> except in the villous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">villi</ENAMEX> in the placenta shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3I.
          All placentae showed ERÎ± staining of resting
          fibroblasts beneath the amniotic epithelium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3K),
          but amniotic epithelium itself showed no immunoreactivity
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3L). Unexpectedly, no ERÎ± immunoreactivity was
          found in extravillous trophoblast cells and adjacent
          decidual cells, either in chorion laeve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Mand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3N</ENAMEX>)
          or at the placental basal plate (not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Oshows

          Trophoblast cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
          Figure 4shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in early (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> h) and

          cells exhibited surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression (arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          Non-dividing trophoblast cells showed

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perinuclear/</ENAMEX>nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C). The
          latter was accompanied by diminution of cell surface

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX>. Mature syncytia in late cultures showed
          no cytoplasmic or nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E).
          Some late cultures derived from PT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> showed a
          mixture of well developed syncytia and persisting
          mononucleated trophoblast cells with ERÎ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX>. However, in late cultures from abnormal
          placentae, the formation of syncytia was abortive (see
          below) and such small syncytia showed regressive changes
          and persisting cytoplasmic ERÎ± immunoreactivity (not
          shown).
        
        
          Variability of outcome in trophoblast cultures
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5shows</TIMEX> that trophoblast cultures from normal
          placentae, characterized by strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thy</ENAMEX>-1 expression in
          the villous core (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A), exhibit progressive formation
          of mid-sized (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) and large syncytial aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX>) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">early</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B) and late cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C). In
          contrast, trophoblast cultures from abnormal placentae,
          which are characterized by weak or no Thy-1 expression in
          the villous core (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D), exhibit abortive formation of
          small (s) syncytial aggregates (panels E and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).
          The ERÎ± expression in normal placentae is high (top of
          inset A), and transformation of cytotrophoblast cells
          into the large syncytia (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~300</NUMEX> Î¼m in diameter) is
          accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> diminution (top insets B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>; see
          also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E). On the other hand, abnormal placentae show
          almost no ERÎ± expression in vivo (top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5D).
          However, strong ERÎ± expression is apparent in early
          culture (top inset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>), and persists thereafter (top inset
          F), apparently due to the lack of mature syncytium
          formation. Bottom insets show actin expression.
          Quantitative evaluation and statistical analysis of
          ERÎ± expression in the placentae and trophoblast cultures
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5G(error bars indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonparametric ANOVA</ENAMEX> was extremely significant ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comparisons Test</ENAMEX> indicated a significant difference in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. Normal placenta (PT1

          difference when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PT4</NUMEX> early and late cultures were
          compared. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late PT1</TIMEX> culture (PT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>) showed
          significantly lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> vs. both PT4 cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). This correlated with differences in syncytium
          formation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Cvs. 5F).
        
        
          Variability of placental ERÎ± expression (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
          In western blot analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> placental samples
          investigated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> showed a distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~65</NUMEX> kDa
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> exhibited barely detectable ERÎ± expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6A). Note that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A, the placentae with strong ERÎ±
          expression belong to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PT1</TIMEX> (normal) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PT2</NUMEX> (slightly
          abnormal) types, while placentae with low ERÎ± expression
          belong to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PT3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PT4</NUMEX> types (moderate and severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormality</ENAMEX>). For statistical purposes in this study, the
          PT1 (normal) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PT2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">placentae</ENAMEX> (slightly abnormal with
          compensatory villous differentiation) were coupled as
          normal placentae (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The PT3</TIMEX> (moderate abnormality
          compensated by maximum dilatation of sinusoids) and PT4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> (severe abnormality without compensatory
          vascular dilatation) were coupled as abnormal placentae
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>).
          Figures 6Band 6Cdemonstrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in early

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows a diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression already at
          early culture, possibly due to the accelerated syncytium
          formation already activated 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Dsummarizes the data on ERÎ± expression in all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> placentae and cultures presented in panels <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A-C</TIMEX>. It
          is apparent that high ERÎ± expression in normal placentae
          in vivo was relatively constant, yet there were marked
          differences among trophoblast cultures, ranging from ERÎ±
          diminution to persisting ERÎ± expression. Indeed, only a
          small proportion of trophoblast cultures from PT2
          placentae showed complete transformation of
          cytotrophoblast cells into the syncytia, while in others
          mature syncytia were accompanied by cytotrophoblast
          cells.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonparametric ANOVA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6Dwas</ENAMEX> extremely
          significant ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comparisons Test</ENAMEX> indicated significant difference in ERÎ±
          expression between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> in vivo when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in vivo
          ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor
          alpha expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in vivo was also significantly
          lower compared to all other columns at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>. Interestingly, the
          ERÎ± expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> early and late cultures
          significantly exceeded that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> in vivo ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
          Altogether, very low in vivo ERÎ± expression in all
          moderately and severely abnormal placentae rose
          significantly (several fold) in early cultures, and high
          expression remained unchanged in late cultures. This
          correlated with poor development of syncytial
          aggregates.

          (freshly isolated) trophoblast cells and early cultures
          showed distinct ERÎ± bands, regardless of the absence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E2-</ENAMEX>) or presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> during
          trophoblast separation, and regardless of their origin
          from normal or abnormal placentae. Late cultures showed
          lower ERÎ± expression in cell lysates from normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> when compared to that from abnormal placentae
          (data not shown).
          Trophoblast cells from normal placentae cultured in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX>+ medium formed mid-sized syncytial clusters in early
          cultures and large syncytial clusters in late cultures
          (l, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A, see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5C</ENAMEX>). The same cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PhR-/E2</ENAMEX>- medium showed a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation in early and late cultures, where
          they did not exceed clusters of small size (s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          Trophoblast cells divided (short arrows) and associated
          together, yet often without fusing (long arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B</ENAMEX>).
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PhR-/E2</ENAMEX>+ medium caused marked acceleration of
          trophoblast differentiation in early cultures, where the
          syncytial clusters already reached a large size. In
          addition, late cultures showed formation of extremely
          large syncytial aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">xl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C).
          Trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae (AP)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhR</ENAMEX>+ medium formed small syncytial clusters
          in early cultures and rare mid-sized clusters in late

          Altogether, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> appears to stimulate terminal

          and abnormal placentae (both expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in vitro) and
          to enhance a fusion of syncytial clusters into extremely
          large aggregates. The presence of phenol red, a weak
          estrogen, in the culture is sufficient to stimulate
          differentiation of trophoblast cells into large syncytia
          in cultures from normal placentae, but not from abnormal
          ones.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> protein
        expression in human placentae by western blot analysis.
        Nuclear ERÎ± expression was confined to the villous
        mononucleated trophoblast cells associated with
        trophoblastic syncytium and differentiating cultured
        cytotrophoblast cells. No nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ± staining</ENAMEX> was detected
        in trophoblastic syncytia in vivo or in vitro.
        Unexpectedly, extravillous trophoblast cells also lacked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>. These observations indicate that trophoblastic nuclear
        ERÎ± expression is characteristic of cytotrophoblast cells
        differentiating into syncytial structures, but not for
        resting cytotrophoblast cells. Additional placental cell
        types expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> were fibroblast-derived vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pericytes</ENAMEX> and extravillous (amniotic) fibroblasts.
        Estrogens may, via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, contribute to the stimulation
        of terminal differentiation of mononucleated trophoblast
        cells into syncytial aggregates. Terminal trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> is associated with diminution of ERÎ±
        expression.
        Nuclear ERÎ± expression is characteristic of
        estrogen-sensitive cells, which might be stimulated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogens</ENAMEX> to proliferate as well as modulate differentiated
        functions. In placental material ERÎ± expression determined
        by western blot analysis showed either strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> or barely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detectable ERÎ±</ENAMEX> bands, and where investigated, there were no
        transitions between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression. In
        addition, strong ERÎ± expression was associated with normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT1 and PT2</TIMEX>), suggesting that in these term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pregnancies ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+ cytotrophoblast cells contribute to
        syncytium differentiation. On the other hand, placentae
        exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality showed virtually
        no ERÎ± expression by western blot analysis or
        immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections (except the
        vessels). This indicates there is no syncytium
        differentiation, although the senescent placentae of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> of advanced maternal age were reported to exhibit a
        higher number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> (dividing) mononuclear trophoblast
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . These observations suggest that dividing
        cytotrophoblast cells do not necessarily contribute to
        syncytium differentiation and may not express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        An unexpected feature was the strong ERÎ± expression of
        cultured trophoblast cells derived from placentae deficient
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in vivo. This observation indicates that
        the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in vivo is not due to the
        inability of trophoblast cells to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in general.
        It might be speculated that under conditions of tissue
        culture factors modulating ERÎ± expression are different
        from that in vivo. Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression is already
        enhanced at the end of the cell separation (time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>), ERÎ±
        expression appears to be inhibited in vivo.
        Virtual lack of in vivo ERÎ± expression seems to be an
        additional indicator of moderate and severe placental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormality</ENAMEX>. Based on in vivo ERÎ± expression, the placentae
        may be divided into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic categories, normal
        placentae: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+, and abnormal placentae: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±-</ENAMEX>.
        However, it should be considered that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PT1 placentae</ENAMEX>,
        the functions of which are in harmony with actual fetal
        demands, may not exhibit compensatory differentiation of
        trophoblast cells and, therefore, may not express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The existence of placental aging is still
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">debated</ENAMEX>, yet various clinical, morphological, cellular and
        molecular aspects of placental senescence have been
        indicated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 24 25 27 28 29 30 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . However,
        it is still unclear if there are any consequences of
        placental aging for normal pregnancy, delivery, and
        neonatal birth weight and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apgar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 48 49</NUMEX> ] . It
        has to be noted that even the abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placenta</ENAMEX> may have
        the capacity to improve its function and compensate for
        demands of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>, e.g., by elongation and
        excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 50</NUMEX> ] .
        As recently indicated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , certain types of
        placental abnormality have also been ascribed to the
        villous immaturity (low or no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> differentiation protein
        expression in placental villi and a lack of blood sinusoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dilatation - PT4</ENAMEX>, see above) accompanied by an existing
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>) or absent placental hypertrophy
        (intrauterine growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX>) - <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. However, it
        has been suggested that although chronic placental
        adaptations may be successful for the fetal survival, e.g.
        in placental senescence or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">maternal diabetes</ENAMEX>, they may lead
        to adverse outcomes later in the life of an individual [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] . Therefore, although it might not be apparent in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newborn</ENAMEX>, the abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placenta</ENAMEX> may indicate a burden for
        the future of an individual and for the quality of the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Yet, placental abnormality is not a rare
        event, since it has been found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the cases in our
        material.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> type expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> were amniotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and fibroblast-derived vascular pericytes.
        Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have been identified in cultured
        fibroblasts of various origins and vascular smooth muscle
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53</NUMEX> ] . Estrogens enhance proliferation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and inhibit vascular smooth muscle migration [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . Binding of estrogens to fibroblasts also
        stimulates fibroblast interaction with epithelial cells
        with subsequent acceleration of maturation of epithelial
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
        The last observation is of particular importance to
        several aspects of this study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activated Thy</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+ villous
        fibroblasts, characterized by secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-1
        differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> among epithelial cells in vivo and
        among cultured trophoblast cells in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58</NUMEX> ] , are
        present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT1 and PT2</TIMEX>, but absent from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PT3</TIMEX> and PT4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] (see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Avs. 5D). Various types of
        placental mesenchymal cells inevitably accompany "purified"
        trophoblast cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , and highly activated Thy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+
        fibroblasts are present in early trophoblast cultures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>
        ] . Extravillous trophoblast cells do not express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, yet
        indeed, there are no Thy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+ fibroblasts among the basal
        plate and chorion laeve extravillous trophoblast cells (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3O). Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+ fibroblasts may stimulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in mononucleated
        trophoblast cells.
        Although estrogens were suspected to stimulate
        trophoblast differentiation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 59</NUMEX> ] , no direct proof has
        been provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX>. Trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> derived from
        normal placentae differentiated into large syncytial
        clusters in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX> without E2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supplementation</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenol</ENAMEX> red in tissue culture media is a weak estrogen,
        sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+ MCF-7
        human breast carcinoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . We report a similar
        estrogenic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> on trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation in cultures from
        normal placentae, but not from abnormal ones.
        Because trophoblast cultures derived from both the
        normal and abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placentae</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+ in time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> cell
        lysates, the above difference can not be ascribed to the
        lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression. Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> at mid-pregnancy levels
        further stimulated syncytium development, as evidenced by
        the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in
        late cultures from normal placentae, and development of
        large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX>. Hence, trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae
        are also capable of differentiating in response to
        estrogenic stimuli, but the level of estrogens must be
        higher. However, it is important to note that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacological</ENAMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200 nM</NUMEX>) have been found to
        suppress development of syncytial aggregates even in
        cultures derived from normal placentae (unpublished data).
        Hence, either low or extremely high levels of estrogens in
        vivo may cause a suppression of placental syncytium
        formation.
        Our observations indicate that the cultures from normal
        and abnormal placentae contain similar trophoblast cells
        capable of differentiating in response to exogenous
        estrogens, but they may differ in the ability of
        accompanying mesenchymal cells to promote this process. One
        might speculate that in cultures derived from normal
        placentae, the weak estrogenic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhR</ENAMEX> is sufficient
        to stimulate trophoblast/mesenchymal cell interactions in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> resulting in a local production of estrogens. It is
        possible that the estrogens can be secreted by the
        syncytiotrophoblast clusters and fibroblasts, because these
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> express the enzyme aromatase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . Indeed,
        trophoblast cultures are capable of producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogens</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] .
        The data are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Our observations
        rise a fundamental question if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX> is not, in fact, an
        essential input for trophoblast differentiation. Yet,
        previous experience has shown that lower estrogen levels
        during pregnancy are indicative of poor fetal condition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placental ERÎ±</ENAMEX> expression in vivo is high in normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> and barely detectable in abnormal placentae. The
        significant increase of estrogen production occurring with
        pregnancy advancement may play a role, via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, in the
        stimulation of terminal differentiation of mononucleated
        trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates and promote
        placental function. This mechanism, however, may not
        operate in abnormal placentae, which show a lack of ERÎ±
        expression.
