        The role of genetics in modulating the immune response
        to infectious diseases is a topic of longstanding interest
        among epidemiologists, clinicians, population geneticists,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunologists</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinkernagel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doherty</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX>
        Prize-winning discovery that cellular immunity to viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> was "restricted" by the highly variable proteins
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Histocompatibility Complex</ENAMEX> (MHC) brought the
        field of immunogenetics into sharper focus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Their
        demonstration that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes recognize virus antigens
        displayed on a host cell "in the context of" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> proteins
        immediately suggested the idea that genetic differences at
        the loci encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> might modulate the intensity and
        effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response to infection.
        The relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> genotype and infectious
        disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> can take several forms. Most simply,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual MHC</ENAMEX> alleles may be especially effective, or
        especially ineffective, at presenting antigens from
        particular infections, so that carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> copies
        of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> allele might predispose an infected
        individual to a more or less favorable disease outcome. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, distinct but compatible hypothesis was suggested by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doherty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinkernagel</ENAMEX> soon after their discovery of MHC
        restriction: since each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> allele provides an infected
        individual with the ability to present a particular set of
        antigens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are heterozygous (say, genotype
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XY</ENAMEX>) at a particular MHC locus may mount a more vigorous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response to a given infection, resulting in a better
        outcome, than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are homozygous for either of
        the corresponding alleles (XX or YY) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Determining whether either or both of these mechanisms
        operates for a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is of interest for a
        variety of basic and applied purposes. Epidemiologically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> genotype partially accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inter-patient</ENAMEX> variation
        in disease severity or progression rates for such long-term
        viral infections as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> lymphotropic virus,
        type 1 (HTLV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> can lead to mechanistic studies to test
        hypotheses about the immunologic basis of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] and could, in principle, be used to
        help predict individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prognoses</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . At least one
        clinical study has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> genotype affects the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response to a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Vaccine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> have begun to take account of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> genotypes
        of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> in choosing antigens for inclusion
        in a vaccine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and it has been suggested that HLA
        genotype be considered in designing samples for inclusion
        in epidemiologic studies of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> immune response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . In evolutionary biology, the possibility that HLA
        heterozygotes are more resistant to infectious diseases is
        the basis for a leading hypothesis to explain the
        unparalleled diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HLA genes</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC genes</ENAMEX> in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX>) and the maintenance of this diversity over
        long periods of evolutionary time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways described above in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> genotype
        may affect disease outcome, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> - association between
        a particular allele and disease outcome - has been
        repeatedly documented in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> by various
        methods of genetic epidemiology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> kind of
        effect, more vigorous immune responses to a pathogen by a
        heterozygote as compared to homozygotes for the same
        alleles, which we term "allele-specific overdominance," has
        been suggested by several animal studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] ,
        although none of these studies is unambiguous (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCUSSION</ENAMEX>). There have been no studies (to our knowledge)
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> that directly compare the infectious disease
        outcomes of heterozygotes to those of homozygotes for the
        same alleles (interestingly, the situation is very
        different for autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>; see DISCUSSION for
        further consideration).
        As an alternative to directly examining the hypothesis
        of allele-specific overdominance, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        have compared the infectious disease outcomes of
        heterozygotes at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> locus, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, to the
        outcomes of homozygotes at the same locus, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In
        many cases, heterozygotes as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> have shown better
        infectious disease outcomes (slower disease progression or
        more rapid clearance of viral infection) than homozygotes
        as a group [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 8 9 14 22</NUMEX> ] , a phenomenon we call
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage." Because these studies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> all homozygotes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> all heterozygotes, they do
        not, in fact, test the hypothesis of allele-specific
        overdominance, which is conditional on the alleles
        involved. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage and
        allele-specific overdominance are different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
        reports of population heterozygote advantage have
        frequently been interpreted as confirmations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doherty-Zinkernagel</ENAMEX> hypothesis of allele-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominance</ENAMEX>.
        In this report, we show that although population
        heterozygote advantage is compatible with allele-specific
        overdominance, it is also compatible with the opposite;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, population heterozygote advantage could arise in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in which every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygote</ENAMEX> had a 
        worse disease outcome than either of
        the corresponding homozygotes ("allele-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underdominance</ENAMEX>"). The reason for this disconnect is an
        unusual form of confounding in which particular (protective
        or detrimental) alleles are over- or under-represented
        among heterozygotes, as we discuss below; an additional
        factor that may be involved results from the effects of
        dominance in creating an asymmetry between homozygotes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX>. As we have suggested above, it is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biologically</ENAMEX> and epidemiologically useful to determine (a)
        the beneficial or harmful effects of specific alleles, and
        (b) the effects of heterozygosity, such as allele-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominance</ENAMEX>; we show here that unconditional comparisons
        of all heterozygotes to all homozygotes can reflect either
        or both of these, and cannot distinguish them. To measure
        the quantitites of direct interest, analyses that compare
        disease outcomes conditional on the alleles involved,
        rather than grouped comparisons of heterozygotes to
        homozygotes, will be more informative.
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section below, we outline a general model
        for the relationship between genotype at a particular HLA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> and infectious disease outcome (which we dichotomize
        into favorable and unfavorable), and we use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
        define the conditions under which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote
        advantage is expected. We show that, depending on allele
        frequencies at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> locus of interest, population
        heterozygote advantage may occur when there is
        allele-specific overdominance, but may also occur under
        other conditions, including allele-specific underdominance.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples are given to illustrate the reasons for the
        lack of concordance between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and allele-specific
        effects. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>, we suggest some possible
        approaches for estimating allele-specific effects.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Model</ENAMEX>
        To determine the precise conditions under which
        population heterozygote advantage will be observed, we
        consider a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that predicts the expected outcome
        of a comparison between heterozygotes and homozygotes in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> study as a function of (i) the frequencies
        of resistant and susceptible alleles at a particular locus
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the relationship between genotype at that locus
        and phenotype. Note that this is 
        not a model for the evolution of
        genotype frequencies or for the maintenance of MHC
        heterozygosity, but simply an algebraic framework for
        predicting the outcome of an epidemiological study of the
        type cited above, given current allele frequencies and
        genotype-phenotype mappings.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Suppose that
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> of a particular locus confer either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> or resistance to a given <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and that
        there are 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> resistance alleles, 
        R 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        R 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,.,</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>

        p 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
         in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> susceptibility alleles 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,.,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
         with frequencies 
        q 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        q 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,.,</ENAMEX> 
        q 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
         . Let be the total frequency of resistant alleles, and
        be the total frequency of susceptible alleles, with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> + 
        q = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Further, define and are the
        sums of squared frequencies of the resistant and
        susceptible alleles, respectively. We assume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        genotype frequencies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] throughout. Thus, Î  is the
        frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> homozygotes and is an inverse measure of
        the diversity of resistant alleles, while Î˜, the frequency
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX>, is an inverse measure of the diversity
        of susceptible alleles.
        We assume that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> have a probability 
        x of a favorable disease course, and
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> (carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different susceptible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SR heterozygotes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> heterozygotes, and RR
        homozygotes have probabilities 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ax ,</ENAMEX> 
        bx , 
        cx , and 
        dx respectively (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). To
        give meaning to the notions of resistant and susceptible
        alleles, we assume 
        d <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1</NUMEX> (RR homozygotes do better
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX>) and 
        a â‰¤ 
        b â‰¤ 
        c (given that one is heterozygous,
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles are better). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can accommodate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dominance</ENAMEX> ( 
        a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; 
        b = 
        c = 
        d ), additivity ( 
        a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; 
        c = 
        d ; 
        b = (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
        d )<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>), or recessiveness ( 
        a = 
        b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
        c = 
        d ) of the resistant alleles. It can
        also accommodate overdominance of the resistant alleles ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1</NUMEX>; 
        b > 
        d ; 
        c > 
        d ), in which each heterozygote does
        better than either corresponding homozygote, and
        underdominance, in which each heterozygote does worse than
        either corresponding homozygote ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX>; 
        b < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; 
        c < 
        d ). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, susceptibility
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> and simply refer respectively
        to lower and higher probabilities of favorable disease
        course, given infection. For simplicity, we assume that all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are equivalent and all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles are equivalent;
        our conclusions could obviously be generalized to cases
        where there is a whole range of effects for different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>.
        Under these assumptions, we can calculate 
        f 
        
          hom 
         and 
        f 
        
          het 
         , the probability of a favorable disease course for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth classes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">heterozygotes</TIMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nd, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 rd</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> thclasses in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        The relative risk (RR) of a favorable outcome for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygote</ENAMEX> compared to a homozygote is defined as:
        
        Population heterozygote advantage corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Various formulations for relative risk (or odds ratio,
        used in case-control studies, such as [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ) are used in
        studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> heterozygosity and disease outcome, but in
        all cases the cutoff is one and a value larger or smaller
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (depending on the precise definition used)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage. Using the
        relative risk equation above, it can be shown by taking
        partial derivatives with respect to the parameters 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p , Î </ENAMEX> and Î˜, that (under the
        assumptions stated above) the relative risk increases with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p and Î˜</ENAMEX> and decreases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î </ENAMEX>. Thus,
        population heterozygote advantage is most likely to be
        observed when resistant alleles are common ( 
        p large) but highly diverse (Î  is
        small), and when susceptible alleles are not diverse (large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î˜</ENAMEX>). These trends can be understood intuitively. Homozygotes
        will be predominantly resistant if <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles are common and
        have little diversity and sensitive when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are
        common and have little diversity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterozygotes</ENAMEX> will be
        predominantly resistant if <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles are highly diverse and
        sensitive if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are highly diverse.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the parameter regions in which population
        heterozygote advantage is expected and those in which the
        contrary is expected: homozygotes on average are more
        likely to have a favorable disease course. Each panel
        reflects a different assumption about the true genetic
        basis of resistance - assuming that resistant alleles are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominant</ENAMEX>; dominant; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>; recessive; or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underdominant</ENAMEX>. In each case, population heterozygote
        advantage, shown as the black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and corresponding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RR > 1</ENAMEX>, is most likely when resistant alleles are highly
        diverse and susceptible alleles have low diversity (bottom
        right of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1shows</TIMEX> that allele-specific overdominance (the
        biological phenomenon of interest) and population
        heterozygote advantage (the finding of epidemiological
        studies such as those cited above) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        things. Population heterozygote advantage (black) may be
        observed even when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is not overdominant, but only
        dominant, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>, recessive or only underdominant, as
        long as allele frequencies are sufficiently far toward the
        lower right of the parameter space (high diversity of
        resistant alleles and low diversity of susceptible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1shows</TIMEX> that this is possible under a
        fairly broad range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations (i.e., there
        are substantial black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> in the dominant, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> and
        recessive panels).
        The converse is also true, though only in what seem to
        be very special circumstances. That is, even when
        allele-specific overdominance holds, it is possible that
        heterozygotes on average will do worse than homozygotes, so
        population heterozygote advantage will not be observed.
        This occurs with genotype frequencies sufficiently far
        toward the top left of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, with a high diversity of
        susceptible alleles and low diversity of resistant ones.
        This occurs only rarely for the parameter values we have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen</ENAMEX> (most of the leftmost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> is black), and this
        seems to be the case for a broad range of parameter
        values.
        Although neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage nor
        allele-specific overdominance implies the other, the two
        phenomena are of course related. Specifically, the
        conditions to observe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage are
        broadest when allele-specific overdominance holds and
        become narrower as the underlying genetics becomes more
        "different" from overdominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> (dominance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-> additivity -> recessiveness -></ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underdominance</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> Examples
        The intuition behind our result that population
        heterozygote advantage need not reflect allele-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominance</ENAMEX> can be seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simple examples.
        Example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suppose</ENAMEX> that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles, each at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> frequency in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) conferring
        resistance and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) conferring susceptibility in the
        homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Population heterozygote advantage will be
        observed if the probability of a favorable outcome for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> is greater than the arithmetic mean of the
        probabilities of favorable outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> homozygotes and
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX>. In this situation, population
        heterozygote advantage does not require overdominance, but
        merely allele effects that are more than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> (partial
        dominance). Dominance of particular HLA alleles conferring
        resistance, and/or recessiveness of susceptibility (poor
        outcome) alleles, have been documented for schistosomiasis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , leprosy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , acute lymphoblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (for
        which an infectious cause is hypothesized) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B (in this case the outcome was vaccine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        When allele frequencies are equal, as in Example <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        partial dominance is sufficient to create population
        heterozygote advantage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . When allele frequencies
        differ, the conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote
        advantage may become broader or narrower. This can be seen
        in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> deliberately extreme example.
        Example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>: Suppose there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> alleles, each with
        frequency <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, each conferring resistance to a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele, with frequency <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, conferring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX>. In the notation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = 
        q = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>; Î  = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>)(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.05</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î˜</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>. In this case, ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of homozygotes in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> will be homozygous for a susceptible allele,
        since the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> is Î˜ = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>, while
        the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> homozygotes is Î  = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>. In contrast,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of heterozygotes will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>. In epidemiological terms, this is a form of
        confounding, in which possession of a resistant allele is
        positively associated with heterozygosity (the exposure of
        interest) and positively associated with having a favorable
        disease course (the outcome of interest). Because of this
        confounding, under some parameter values, population
        heterozygote advantage can occur even when heterozygotes
        are not at an advantage relative to their corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX>. Specifically, population heterozygote
        advantage may be observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is additive
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> have risks equal to the average of the risks
        of the corresponding homozygotes), when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is
        recessive, or even when it is underdominant (heterozygotes
        have higher risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> than either corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygote</ENAMEX>).
        Continuing this example, suppose that the resistant
        alleles are recessive to the susceptible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, so that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> copies of the susceptible
        allele have favorable outcomes with probability <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> resistant alleles have favorable
        outcomes with probability <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>; these assumptions correspond
        to 
        x = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>; 
        a = 
        b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; 
        c = 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.33</NUMEX>. In this example, there are
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> since there is only one S allele; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX>
        heterozygotes make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the population (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pq</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>), while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> heterozygotes
        (carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles) make up 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p 2- Î </ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.225</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.5%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The probability of a favorable outcome for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> will be the weighted average of the
        probabilities of a favorable outcome for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX> and RR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> (using equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1</NUMEX>):
        
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">homozygotes</TIMEX> (using equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2</NUMEX>), the probability of a
        favorable outcome 
        f 
        
          hom 
         will be the weighted average of the probabilities for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>) and for RR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>):
        
        Thus, heterozygotes on average will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.26</NUMEX> times more
        likely to have a favorable outcome, even though each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygote</ENAMEX> has the same outcome as if s/he were
        homozygous for the worse of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles s/he carries.
        In epidemiological terms, heterozygotes would have a
        relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX> of an unfavorable outcome compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX>.
        Both of these examples were chosen for the purposes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clarity</ENAMEX>, rather than for precise reflection of the allele
        frequencies in real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>; in particular, few if any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> allele with a frequency of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. Moreover, we have simplified the effects of alleles
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories, resistant and susceptible (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>),
        which are simply relative notions. In fact, real alleles
        will likely have a spectrum of effects, ranging from highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resistant</ENAMEX>, to highly susceptible, with some alleles having
        "no effect." Note, however, that "no effect" is also a
        relative term, and refers to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> whose effect on
        disease outcome is close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> average.
      
      
        Discussion
        The foregoing examples show that the finding of
        population heterozygote advantage, as in the infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> studies cited, does not support an inference of
        allele-specific overdominance, the condition of primary
        interest as an immunological hypothesis and a mechanism for
        the maintenance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> diversity. Put another way,
        population heterozygote advantage may appear due to a
        combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct mechanisms we defined in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>: the protective or detrimental effects of
        particular alleles (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>), and the
        effects of heterozygosity itself. The effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> appear as effects of heterozygosity vs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygosity</ENAMEX> because heterozygotes and homozygotes will in
        general carry different distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> alleles;
        thus, in an analysis that fails to condition on the alleles
        carried, heterozygosity is confounded with the alleles
        carried.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of correctly separating the effects of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> from the effects of heterozygosity
        conditional on those alleles, is that each of these
        measures is a characteristic of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, rather than
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For example, if genotypes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YY</ENAMEX> have
        relative risks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for clearance of a viral
        infection, then this should hold true regardless of who
        else is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In contrast, we have shown that
        population heterozygote advantage depends on not only the
        effects of individual genotypes on disease outcome, but
        also on allele frequencies. Therefore, even if biological
        and epidemiologic mechanisms were identical in two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, but allele frequencies differed in those two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, it would be perfectly reasonable to find
        population heterozygote advantage in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but not the
        other.
        The problem we have described with measuring population
        heterozygote advantage is not in principle limited to
        susceptibility/resistance studies of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious diseases</ENAMEX>. In principle,
        the same problem could occur in any study of HLA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> outcome. Interestingly, however,
        in our review of the literature on HLA-chronic disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>, we have found no examples of the problem.
        Moreover, direct estimates of the allele-specific effects
        of heterozygosity (relative to the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX>), nearly absent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX>-HLA
        literature, are frequently found in studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> genotype
        and chronic (mostly autoimmune) diseases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . We
        do not know the reason for this difference in approach, but
        suspect that some infectious disease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>,
        informed by the evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> of overdominance
        for infectious disease resistance and by animal studies,
        may have a special interest in detecting effects of
        heterozygosity 
        per se . Many studies of
        HLA-autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> associations, on the other hand,
        seem to focus more on the effects of individual alleles
        and, having established these, move on to investigate the
        dependence of these effects on genetic modifiers, including
        the identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s other allele at the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>.
        We have shown that when allele-specific overdominance
        exists, it will often be manifest as population
        heterozygote advantage, but that a finding of population
        heterozygote advantage may be consistent with other
        patterns of allele-specific effects; for example, when
        resistant and susceptible alleles are equally common and
        equally diverse, population heterozygote advantage will
        occur if allele-specific effects are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>, dominant or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominant</ENAMEX>. It is difficult to generalize, without doing
        a specific epidemiologic study, about how the prevalence
        and diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> would be likely to occur
        in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Brien et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] found a
        spectrum of estimated effects of Class I HLA alleles on
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, and this spectrum seems visually
        to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly symmetric</NUMEX>, but further information would be
        required to determine plausible values of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> , Î˜ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>  from these data. One might
        expect the distribution to be skewed toward resistant
        alleles for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that have exerted long-term selection
        on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but it is difficult to make confident
        predictions about such patterns without detailed knowledge
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-pathogen coevolution.
        Our results do not deny that allele-specific
        overdominance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> exists in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with
        respect to infectious disease resistance, but simply raise
        doubts about the reliability of the major evidence that has
        been adduced in support of this phenomenon. Existing data
        suggest that allele-specific overdominance may exist in
        some animal infectious diseases, but also that simple
        dominance and other outcomes are commonly observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Several experimental studies have examined this question
        using single-strain infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and while
        suggestions of allele-specific overdominance have been
        made, none of the studies has been entirely convincing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doherty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinkernagel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] demonstrated using congenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> had more vigorous immune
        responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytic choriomeningitis</ENAMEX> virus (LCMV) than
        the corresponding homozygotes, but since the pathology of
        the infection they used is due to the immune response, the
        enhanced immune response actually resulted in reduced
        survival. A study in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of resistance to 
        Toxoplasma gondii showed that F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> offspring of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genetically divergent
        parent strains were more resistant than either parent
        strain, but there seems to be no demonstration that
        heterozygosity at an MHC locus is responsible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ,
        while another reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] that has been cited [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        as showing overdominance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-pathogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> does not appear to address the question directly. A
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Marek's disease</ENAMEX> virus in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> seems to
        demonstrate allele-specific overdominance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> using
        defined genetic backgrounds, but the report does not
        clearly specify how homogeneous the genetic background was
        in these experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        From the perspective of the population genetics debate
        concerning the role of overdominance in maintaining
        polymorphism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>, we should note that this mechanism
        requires allele-specific overdominance for total fitness,
        not for resistance to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. As noted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doherty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinkernagel</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , simple dominance for
        resistance to each of several <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> can create
        allele-specific overdominance for total fitness, if
        different alleles confer resistance to different diseases [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 31</NUMEX> ] . For these reasons, our results, while relevant to
        the longstanding debate over the relative importance of
        various kinds of balancing selection in maintaining MHC
        diversity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , raise doubts about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of several
        lines of evidence for the overdominance hypothesis.
        Simple and accurate methods exist to determine for a
        single pair of alleles how the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible genotypes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> heterozygote) affect disease outcome,
        and these methods have been used frequently in the
        literature on autoimmunity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] and once
        (to our knowledge) in the HLA-infectious disease literature
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . It is of additional interest for epidemiologists,
        immunologists, vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> and evaluators, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population geneticists</ENAMEX> to know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> heterozygosity
        in general improves the immune response to and outcome of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious diseases</ENAMEX>. To answer this question in a
        meaningful way, it will be necessary to develop improved
        methods that estimate the effect of heterozygosity while
        conditioning on the alleles involved. Meanwhile, findings
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygote advantage should not be
        interpreted as confirming the mechanism of allele-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overdominance</ENAMEX>.

        The methodological principles in this report grew out of
        discussions held by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. ML formulated the

        Appendix
        In this appendix we prove that the relative risk defined
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) is increasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and Î˜, and decreasing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î .</ENAMEX>
        As a preliminary result that will be useful later, note
        that and .
        
        
          Proof that the relative risk is
          increasing in p 
         . We must show that . To do so, we calculate:
        
        By definition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î  + Î˜</ENAMEX> are each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between zero</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and all of the parameters Î , Î˜, 
        a , 
        b , and 
        c are positive; and by assumption, 
        a â‰¤ 
        b â‰¤ 
        c . Therefore; therefore, all terms
        in the partial derivative are positive, so the relative
        risk is increasing in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QED</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Proof that relative risk is decreasing
          in Î  
         . Since 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> = 
        f 
        
          het 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
        f 
        
          hom 
         , it is sufficient to show that the numerator, 
        f 
        
          het 
         , is decreasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î </ENAMEX> and the denominator, 
        f 
        
          hom 
         , is increasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î </ENAMEX>. (This is intuitively clear: 
        f 
        
          het 
         is the weighted average of the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nd, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 rd</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> thcolumns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; increasing Î 
        reduces the weight on the highest-risk category, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        thcolumn with risk 
        cx , thereby reducing the weighted
        average. Similarly, increasing Î  increases the
        representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> homozygotes among homozygotes, thereby
        increasing the average risk of homozygotes.) Formally:
        first, we show that 
        f 
        
          het 
         , is decreasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î </ENAMEX>, namely that . Taking the partial
        derivative and rearranging we find:
        
        This is justified as follows: The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term is positive
        by defnition. Inside the curly brackets in the penultimate
        line above, we have the sum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> terms, each of which
        itself is the product of a nonpositive term and a
        nonnegative term; thus, the curly brackets are nonpositive.
        Specifically, and are both nonpositive because we assumed 
        a â‰¤ 
        b â‰¤ 
        c . [(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2- Î˜</ENAMEX>] is nonnegative as noted at
        the beginning of the appendix. The term in curly brackets
        is nonpositive, and the term outside is positive, so the
        whole expression is nonpositive, as stated.
        It is apparent by inspection that the denominator of the
        relative risk, 
        f 
        
          hom 
         , is increasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î </ENAMEX>. Since the numerator of the
        relative risk is nonincreasing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î </ENAMEX>, and the denominator of
        the relative risk is increasing, the relative risk is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreasing in Î </ENAMEX>.
        The argument that the relative risk is increasing in Î˜
        is exactly symmetric to the argument for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î </ENAMEX>.
