        The effects of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) are mediated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of ligand dependent
        transcription factors, the retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptors</ENAMEX> (RAR)
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoid X receptors</ENAMEX> (RXR) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> are
        activated by all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans RA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRs</ENAMEX> are
        activated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> only. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> known members
        of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> (termed Î±, Î², and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³</NUMEX>) encoded by separate
        genes. Each gene may express several different isoforms
        because of alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> and differential promoter
        usage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRs</ENAMEX> contain functional
        domains for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and ligand binding, dimerization with other
        transcription factors, and transactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRs</ENAMEX> function as heterodimers that bind
        to response elements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of target genes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulate RA</ENAMEX> dependent transcription. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR/RXR</ENAMEX> binding to
        nuclear receptor corepressors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> in the
        absence of ligand inhibits activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive
        genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Ligand binding displaces the repressors and
        recruits coactivator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> which have
        histone acetyltransferase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Histone
        acetylation allows for chromatin unwinding and
        transcriptional initiation of target gene expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Previous studies have demonstrated that
        posttranslational modifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRs</ENAMEX> are
        critical to the biological activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. In
        the RARÎ± amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX>, a consensus mitogen activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) phosphorylation sequence was found to
        be a target of cyclin H and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk7</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> was shown to
        bind the cyclin H/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cdk7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in vitro and phosphorylation
        of serine 77 enhanced the transactivation function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        This phosphorylation was required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> mediated
        differentiation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells into parietal endoderm [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        These studies point to the importance of phosphorylation in
        the proper functioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX>.
        Mutation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> to alanine in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> has been shown
        to inhibit the basal activation function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Other mutations have also been shown to decrease RAR
        function. RAC65 cells, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> resistant clone of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pluripotent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P19</ENAMEX> embryonal carcinoma line, express a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated RARÎ±</ENAMEX> that lacks part of the ligand binding domain
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . As a result of this mutation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RAC65</NUMEX> cells do not
        differentiate when exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. An RARÎ± clone truncated
        after amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 403</ENAMEX> was effective in repressing reporter
        gene activity and blocking wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAR</ENAMEX> function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
        . A single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G303E</NUMEX>) impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        binding affinity and significantly reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
        activity from responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. These studies
        illustrate the usefulness of dominant negative RAR mutants
        in elucidating mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> signaling.
        In the present study we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, by inhibiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk7</ENAMEX> expression, reduces phosphorylation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>. We examined the role of hypophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> by
        mutating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">cdk7</NUMEX> phosphorylation site in the receptor
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S77A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> RARÎ± mutant decreased
        proliferation of human cancer cells consistent with
        inhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> phase transition. Decreased
        proliferation of the mutant clones was associated with
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 expression and ERK1
        activity, similar to the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. This study
        illustrates a novel mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferation</ENAMEX> (i.e., by decreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> phosphorylation)
        and that in the absence of ligand, hypophosphorylated RARÎ±
        can mimic the molecular and cellular changes associated
        with retinoid treatment.
      
      
        Results
        The mechanisms which regulate cyclin H/cdk7
        phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> have not been elucidated. To
        determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> itself could affect the phosphorylation
        status of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, we treated SCC4 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> lines
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼M all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans RA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> treatment decreased expression of both cyclin H and cdk7
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SCC4</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> fold. To determine if reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk7</ENAMEX> expression correlated with decreased RARÎ±
        phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from
        vehicle and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> treated SCC4 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells. As shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, relative phosphorylation levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> decreased
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> fold, similar to the reduction in cyclin H and cdk7
        expression. Previous studies have shown that the amino
        terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> is phosphorylated by MAPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . To determine the participation of MAPKs
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> phosphorylation, we performed RARÎ±
        immunoprecipitation on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCC25 cells</ENAMEX> treated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEK/ERK</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB203580</ENAMEX>.
        Treatment with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> did not change relative RARÎ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). We concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">repressed cyclin H/cdk7</ENAMEX> expression which correlated with
        reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> phosphorylation levels.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> is a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] . To determine the effects of hypophosphorylated RARÎ± on
        the growth of human cancer cells, we expressed an S77A RARÎ±
        expression construct in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells. The serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at
        position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was previously shown to be the target of cyclin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H/cdk7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> mutant resulted in decreased
        relative phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> in
        stable clones compared to G418 resistant control cells. To
        confirm that this effect was due to expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophosphorylated</ENAMEX> RARÎ± mutant, we also created stable
        clones expressing either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA tagged RARÎ±</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S77A</TIMEX> mutant.
        As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, only clones expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-RARÎ±</ENAMEX> and not
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-S77A</ENAMEX> mutant showed phosphorylation on serine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. These experiments indicate that the relative
        amount of phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells was decreased
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S77A</TIMEX> mutant. SCC25 cells expressing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> mutant
        RARÎ± proliferated at markedly reduced rates compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The S77A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> mutants grew at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-50%</NUMEX> of the rate of G418 resistant controls in culture.
        By comparison, proliferation of clones expressing HA tagged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of G418 resistant control cells. We concluded
        that decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> phosphorylation produces inhibition of
        proliferation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells.
        To determine if decreased proliferation of the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> clones correlated with inhibition of cell cycle
        progression, we performed BrdU incorporation analysis. As
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, less than half the percentage of S77A
        mutant cells incorporated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BrdU</ENAMEX> compared to the G418
        resistant control clones. By comparison, there were no
        significant differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tagged RARÎ±</ENAMEX> clones and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G418</ENAMEX> resistant control cells. These
        results indicate that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> to S phase transition of the
        cell cycle is inhibited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S77A</TIMEX> mutant clones. To
        corroborate this conclusion, we examined expression of the
        G1 phase cyclin dependent kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> p21
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">WAF1/Cip1and p27 Kip1in</ENAMEX> G418 resistant and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S77A</ENAMEX> mutant
        clones. We also determined the expression of the S phase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> cyclin A in these cells. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6,</ENAMEX>
        expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase markers <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p21 WAF1/Cip1and</ENAMEX> p27
        Kip1in the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> clones was up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> fold higher
        compared to control cells. In contrast, expression of the S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phase marker cyclin A</ENAMEX> was decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> fold in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clones
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAR1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and was undetectable in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> others (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAR3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
        when compared to G418 resistant control cells. These
        results indicate that the decreased proliferation observed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S77A</TIMEX> RARÎ± mutant clones is due to inhibition of cell
        cycle progression at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G1</TIMEX> to S phase transition.
        The antiproliferative effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> have been attributed
        to its inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcriptional activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        While the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> RARÎ± mutant has been shown to inhibit
        transactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> response elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , its effects
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity have not been characterized. We first
        addressed this issue by transiently transfecting a
        heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> containing a consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to the luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] along with
        wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> or S77A mutant expression vectors. In the
        absence of ligand, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S77A</TIMEX> RARÎ± mutant inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        activity from this construct by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, similar to treatment
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼M all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans RA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The wild type receptor
        possessed slight anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> reduction compared to control cells transfected
        with blank expression vector). These results indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophosphorylated RARÎ±</ENAMEX> can mimic the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity.
        To determine if reductions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels could
        account for the observed transcriptional inhibition by the
        S77A mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>, we compared expression of fos and jun
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX> resistant control clones and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S77A</ENAMEX> RARÎ±
        expressing cells. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fra-1</ENAMEX> expression was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> RARÎ± mutant clones. Expression of
        c-jun was reduced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 4</TIMEX> fold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S77A</TIMEX> RARÎ± cells
        compared to G418 resistant control clones. JunB expression
        was also decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 20</NUMEX> fold in mutant RARÎ±
        expressing cells. Expression of c-fos, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fra-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FosB</ENAMEX>, and
        JunD was not detected under normal growth conditions in
        SCC25 cells. These results indicate that decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        protein expression correlates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcriptional
        inhibition by hypophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        Upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcription factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to inhibit epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> (EGFR)
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . To determine if hypophosphorylated RARÎ±
        could inhibit EGFR expression, we examined expression of
        the growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> by western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blot</ENAMEX> in control and
        S77A mutant cells. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> expression was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> clones and was reduced
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in the remaining clone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RAR1</NUMEX>). To determine if this
        dramatically decreased EGFR expression could inhibit
        downstream components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> signaling, we also examined
        activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERK1</TIMEX> (a terminal effector in the mitogen
        activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase pathway</ENAMEX>). Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERK1</ENAMEX> in S77A
        mutant cells was expressed at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> of the levels
        found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX> resistant control clones. Overall ERK1
        expression was not affected by hypophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        These results indicate that components of the EGFR
        signaling pathway, upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcription factors,
        are inhibited by hypophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        Activation of growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptors</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        induce expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . To determine if
        EGF signaling correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SCC25</NUMEX> cells,
        we first incubated cultures in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> depleted serum for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein expression. We then
        stimulated these cultures with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 4</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> produced dramatic induction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein expression within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> after its
        addition. c-fos expression peaked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> fold over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstimulated</ENAMEX> levels at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> addition.
        Following a similar time course, c-jun expression increased
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> fold following stimulation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>. Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fra</ENAMEX>-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> expression was also noted, although the increase
        was of less magnitude than that observed for c-fos and
        c-jun. The effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein expression were
        completely blocked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase inhibitor tyrphostin
        AG1478 (data not shown), indicating that growth factor
        receptor signaling directly correlates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein
        expression. These data suggest that in the unliganded
        state, hypophosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> can mimic the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> expression, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERK1</TIMEX> activity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein
        levels.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The antiproliferative effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> have been recognized
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. This important chemotherapeutic property of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> has been attributed to a number of molecular mechanisms.
        Decreased growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> receptor
        expression has been proposed as a potential growth
        inhibitory mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> mediated
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity is believed to be important in
        cellular growth control by this ligand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        inhibition via direct interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inhibition of jun
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal kinase was shown to prevent c-jun
        phosphorylation, resulting in decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        ] . Competition between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for limiting amounts
        of the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor coactivator CBP</ENAMEX> may also account
        for decreases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcriptional activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In
        the present study we have described a new mechanism by
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> can inhibit cellular proliferation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inhibited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk7</ENAMEX> expression which correlated with
        hypophosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> on serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>. To separate the
        specific role of hypophosphorylated RARÎ± from the
        pleiotropic effects of the ligand, we expressed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-phosphorylatable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S77A mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in human cancer
        cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> RARÎ± mutant inhibited proliferation of
        SCC25 cells even in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, thereby mimicking
        the growth inhibitory effect of the ligand. This growth
        inhibition correlated with a delay in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> to S phase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. EGFR expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        activity were inhibited by the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>, effects which
        are also achieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> treatment alone. We determined that
        decreases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 protein expression observed in the RARÎ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutant</ENAMEX> clones were primarily due to diminished EGFR
        signaling. Therefore while ligand bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> has been shown
        to activate a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> target genes, the
        hypophosphorylated form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> created in some
        cells following retinoid treatment may be important in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>. In support of this hypothesis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochette-Egly et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] described decreased
        transactivation function by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S77A mutant RARÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        Previously we characterized another RARÎ± mutant in which
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor protein</ENAMEX> was truncated after amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 403</ENAMEX>,
        thereby deleting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This truncated
        receptor exhibited similar properties to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S77A</NUMEX> mutant
        (growth inhibition and repression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive gene
        expression including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>). Repression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive
        gene expression was believed due to the inability of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> to interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> via its shortened carboxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . By the same token this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptor</ENAMEX> did
        not affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity, presumably due
        to its inability to compete for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . We observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decreased AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in transient transfections using
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAR403</NUMEX> mutant likely due to decreased EGFR expression.
        However, the mechanisms by which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S77A</TIMEX> mutant inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive gene expression is unknown. The RARÎ± amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> is not known to interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> or its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor PCAF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 18</ENAMEX> ] . Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> bind
        to the interaction domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repressor proteins</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NCoR</ENAMEX> via region D of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> rather than the amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Despite the lack of obvious interaction of
        the RAR amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> with nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cofactors</ENAMEX>, the
        S77A mutation may alter the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional structure of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. This altered configuration may prevent the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptor</ENAMEX> from releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repressor proteins</ENAMEX> or
        recruiting coactivators in the presence of ligand. The S77A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptor</ENAMEX> was shown to inhibit ligand dependent
        transactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , but the
        mechanism of this reduction (e.g., competition for binding
        sites, cofactor interaction, ligand binding) has not been
        determined.
        In summary, decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> phosphorylation correlating
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> mediated inhibition of cyclin H and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk7</ENAMEX> expression
        illustrates a new mechanism by which ligand can indirectly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulate receptor activation</ENAMEX>. This raises the question of
        how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> initially downregulates cyclin H and cdk7
        expression, whether by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> inhibition or through negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoid</ENAMEX> response elements in the regulatory regions of the
        genes. The characterization of potentially altered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">interactions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between hypophosphorylated RARÎ±</TIMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactors</ENAMEX> will provide unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insight</ENAMEX> into how
        post-translational modification of nuclear hormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receptors</ENAMEX> regulates repressor release, coactivator
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX>, histone acetylation, and transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.

          The human squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma lines used in this
