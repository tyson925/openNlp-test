          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ciliate</ENAMEX> nuclear dimorphism
          Following pair-wise mating (conjugation), each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exconjugant</ENAMEX> replaces its old parental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>,
          developed from a mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of its genotypically
          new zygotic nucleus (review: [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ). The mitotic sister
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> precursor (anlage) is set aside as the new
          diploid germline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIC</ENAMEX>, which is then heterochromatically
          silenced; all known gene expression is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> anlage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anlage</ENAMEX> begins
          differentiation, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> is apoptotically destroyed [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . The mature exconjugant resumes feeding and
          establishes a vegetative clone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a karyonide</NUMEX>) propagated
          by binary fission, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIC</ENAMEX> replicates as a
          typical diploid mitotic nucleus and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> replicates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amitotically</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Macronuclear development
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ciliates</ENAMEX> employ a strategy of irreversible genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>, a specialized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression organelle. Analogous developmental
          strategies have evolved several times outside the
          ciliates, scattered across phyla [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19</NUMEX> ] ; thus,
          mammalian immunity depends on irreversible somatic genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Initially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC anlage</ENAMEX>'s
          chromosomes are endo-reduplicated, evidenced by visible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyteny</ENAMEX> in a variety of ciliates. The ploidy can reach
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Thus, each sequence
          that survives subsequent elimination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>-destined) is
          represented by numerous polytene chromatids; in
          principle, each could be processed differently. Near the
          end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endo-replication</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX> many transposons
          and transposon-like sequences are eliminated by precise
          excision (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Eliminated Sequences</ENAMEX> or IESs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ).
          Excision directly precedes massive chromatid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">de novo telomere</ENAMEX> formation
          ("chromosome healing" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ) and the degradation of IESs
          and of "spacer" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> that lie between blocks of sequences
          destined for different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes. The surviving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (as few as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the germline sequences) reside
          on many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes, which are then highly
          amplified to the level of the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>.
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxytricha MAC</ENAMEX> genome is typical of
          those of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX>. It consists ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> copies of
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> different tiny, acentric linear chromosomes. They
          range in length from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.5 kbp</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>15 kbp</NUMEX> (number
          average length, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2.4 kbp</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Garrett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.R.W.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witherspoon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.H.</ENAMEX>, unpublished), comprised almost
          exclusively of transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Many carry only one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (review: [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ), but some carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          each ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Sanders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Fausett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.G.D.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.R.W.</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.H.</ENAMEX>, unpublished).
          Not all identical polytene chromatids of the anlage
          are processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identically</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by the generation
          of alternative processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes. We
          have studied alternative processing of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> locus,
          which generates a family of three overlapping chromosomes
          ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] ; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, below). Analogous phenomena
          have been described in other ciliates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 31</NUMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Chromatid breakage and de novo telomere
          formation
          Telomeres are not encoded 
          in situ at the ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>-destined
          blocks [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] , but are polymerized onto new ends 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> by telomerase. These
          processes have been best studied in 
          Tetrahymena thermophila and in
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX>, including 
          Euplotes crassus . Breakage occurs
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~200</NUMEX> "cut" sites in 
          Tetrahymena , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~40,000</NUMEX> sites
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A short 15 bp</TIMEX> 
          cis -acting sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>, is
          necessary and sufficient to direct breakage at or near it
          in 
          Tetrahymena , presumably being the
          binding site of the breakage enzyme - the "cutter" [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX> sits in eliminated sequence, a short,
          variable distance from the positions that receive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeres</ENAMEX>. An analogous sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-cbs</ENAMEX>, has been
          characterized in 
          Euplotes by sequence comparisons
          and analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA intermediates</ENAMEX> and products of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>
          development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] . At a fixed distance from
          itself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-cbs</ENAMEX> directs a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-nucleotide staggered cut, with
          a protruding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'OH to which telomerase adds telomere
          repeats. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-cbs</ENAMEX> can sit within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>-destined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, or in the adjacent "spacer" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>; in some cases
          both generated ends receive telomere repeats, so that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> resultant telomere-tailed ends overlap by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 bp</TIMEX>. A cbs
          has been tentatively identified in 
          Stylonychia lemnae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ; no cbs
          is known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxytrichs</ENAMEX>, although we assume it exists (see
          Discussion).
          The 
          in vitro properties of telomerase
          are consistent with its known role in creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeres</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , as well as,
          presumably, in all other ciliates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Telomerases
          from exconjugants of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> and 
          Euplotes have been extensively
          studied 
          in vitro . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. crassus enzyme</ENAMEX> can only act on
          oligomers that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> with telomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template RNA</ENAMEX> at their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' terminus, unless assisted by a dissociable factor
          (chromosome healing factor), which contributes extra mass
          to the enzyme in exconjugants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Telomerase,
          assisted by this factor, still requires a block of dGs or
          telomere repeats internal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' primer end [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          In contrast, the 
          Tetrahymena exconjugant enzyme can
          add to a primer completely devoid of telomere repeats in
          special reaction conditions, and shows no evidence of
          increased mass beyond that of the vegetative enzyme [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
          ] .
          Although chromatid breakage requires an endonuclease
          activity, the cutter, directed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cbs</ENAMEX>-binding activity,
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cbs-dependent</ENAMEX> "binder/cutter" activity has been
          detected 
          in vitro . The cutter could be an
          activity of telomerase itself [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 43</NUMEX> ] . Telomerase of
          both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euplotes</ENAMEX> has a single-strand
          endonuclease activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 43</NUMEX> ] . It can trim potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> back, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' terminus pairs with template
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Thus, while it may serve a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' editing
          function, the existence of a nuclease activity in
          potential proximity to the site of chromatid breakage is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provocative</ENAMEX>, suggesting that telomerase provides the

          double-strand cutting activity, and thereby explaining
          coupled action between chromatid cutting and telomere
          addition (see below). However, Niu 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , in a study of a
          similar endonuclease activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast telomerase</ENAMEX>,
          argue that since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> perform no developmental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX>, this activity plays some role other than
          in fragmentation.
          It is generally believed that the developmental action
          of telomerase is tightly coupled to cleavage. The 
          Oxytricha multi-TAS regions we
          describe here seem to cause an uncoupling of these steps;
          our models invoke the ability of telomerase to act
          independently of the binder/cutter. 
          Tetrahymena telomerase and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binder/cutter</ENAMEX> appear to act concertedly 
          in vivo , as if in a physical
          complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . However, this contrasts with 
          in vitro properties of the enzyme
          from exconjugants: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.) it acts on non-telomeric primers [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 50</NUMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) it apparently is no larger than the
          vegetative enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, telomerase can
          act in the vegetative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> of 
          Paramecium , uncoupled from
          chromatid breakage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . It remains to be seen if a
          complex between telomerase and binder/cutter activity
          does exist. We consider models that assume the two
          activities exist separately, in a loose complex. This
          assumption is supported by our results - as well as those
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Möllenbeck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klobutcher</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] - which indicate that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exonucleolytic</ENAMEX> erosion of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> must sometimes occur
          before telomerase caps them. It is possible that the
          nuclease activity of telomerase causes the erosion.
        
        
          Telomere addition sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>)
          The exact nucleotide positions where telomere repeats
          are added have been examined in several ciliates
          (reviewed by [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 53</NUMEX> ] ). Cloned chromosome ends from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> indicated heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> placement,
          which we attributed to exonuclease erosion of the broken
          ends prior to telomerase action [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Analogous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multi-TAS</ENAMEX> regions have been described in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Hamilton</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Orias</ENAMEX>, pers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comm</ENAMEX>.) and in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramecium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Le Mouël</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX>, pers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comm</ENAMEX>.). In stark contrast, no heterogeneity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> positions has been reported for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> crassus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes,
          although recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Möllenbeck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klobutcher</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] report
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple TASs</ENAMEX> at the end of a MIC-limited "spacer"
          segment. Thus, in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> and 
          Paramecium telomeres are added at a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> collection of clustered sites, which we
          here refer to as "multi-TAS regions," whereas in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> crassus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> is used for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>-destined end ("single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> regions"). Here we
          describe both kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in 
          Oxytricha , both involved in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes.
        
        
          Alternative processing of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> locus
          A family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosomes was
          discovered when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> chromosome cloned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMA81</TIMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX>-blotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAC DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The
          chromosomes consist of three contiguous segments of
          germline sequence, referred to as the "common region"
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>) and the left and right "arms" (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Each
          segment bears a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 25</NUMEX> ] . The
          smallest chromosome, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC III</ENAMEX>, consists solely of the
          common <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> with telomeres. Arm-alone chromosomes have
          never been observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetative MAC DNA</ENAMEX>, and are
          proposed to be replication-incompetent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          large chromosomes each have a common <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC I</ENAMEX>
          carries a right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC II</ENAMEX>, a left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Therefore,
          the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chromosomes each carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ,
          a novel finding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spirotrichs</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ). The
          identities of the genes have not suggested any selective
          advantage to such couplings, but the alternative
          processing of this locus has been conserved within the
          Oxytrichs, and with variation, in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stylonychids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seegmiller and K.R.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished).
          We proposed that this nested set is generated by
          alternative breakage patterns of polytene chromatids of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> locus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ; bottom, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). While the
          arm-distal positions must be efficiently cut on each
          chromatid, alternative breakage at the regions bounding
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> was proposed. Thus, not all CR-arm junctions are
          cut on each chromatid (analogous to an incomplete DNA
          restriction digest), leaving arm DNA appended to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> DNA
          in some cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MACs I and II</ENAMEX>), and not others (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC III</ENAMEX>).
          Given the apparent functioning of exonucleolytic erosion
          following chromatid cutting, note that another way to
          explain the generation of arm-less chromosomes is to
          assume that chromatids are only cut at arm-distal sites,
          and that erosion alternatively stops at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> position, or proceeds completely through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> to
          stop in the CR-boundary multi-TAS region. By this model
          arm-alone chromosomes never exist-even transiently; use
          of anchored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (see below) is intended, to search for
          such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and to distinguish between this
          massive-erosion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and the incomplete-cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          The latter model seems more parsimonious to us, and we
          assume it in discussing the results of this report.
          Incomplete cutting at the CR boundaries might be
          caused by poor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or poor cut-sites for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binder/cutter.</ENAMEX> In the work presented here we employed an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchored PCR</ENAMEX> procedure to precisely map telomere addition
          sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>). We show that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CR boundaries,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CR-Right</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR-Left</ENAMEX>, are multiple-TAS regions, but the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal regions have single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>. Models are
          proposed to explain why the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> putatively
          incompletely-cut CR boundary regions also are
          multiple-TAS regions.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Karyonidal reproducibility
          A karyonide is a clone of cells established by an
          emerging exconjugant - that is, a clone of cells that
          have the same ancestral, developed new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . If
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> erosion is responsible for the heterogeneity we
          see, then it should be different in each different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karyonide</ENAMEX>. Figure 3Ashows displays of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR-R TASs</ENAMEX> from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of karyonides with different alleles of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> locus. The displays for the different genotypes
          differ at many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>, but inter-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">karyonidal</NUMEX> variation
          is very slight, by comparison. In a separate experiment
          (not shown), similarly-identical display patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR-R</ENAMEX>
          were generated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent a/b heterozygote
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karyonides</ENAMEX> (displays from both P1-anchor and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P2</NUMEX>-anchor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were identical, demonstrating that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P2</NUMEX>-anchor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> does not generate artifacts). While the allele
          composition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-locus is identical in each pair of
          karyonides, the karyonides are not otherwise genetically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identical</ENAMEX> (unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> karyonides in many ciliates; 
          e.g. , see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] ), but are
          independently derived, so that the backgrounds differ
          between karyonides, which might explain these slight
          variations. Perhaps more interestingly, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-karyonidal variations could be attributed to the
          limited number of chromatids available to be partitioned
          into the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> classes represented by the display
          bands; however, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-riding reproducibility implies
          that the positions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX> are dictated genetically
          by 
          cis -acting sequences.
        
        
          Allelic specificity
          Note that if TAS positions are dictated solely by 
          cis -acting sequences, then the
          pattern of the a/b heterozygote should be equivalent to
          the sum of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homozygote patterns (a/a + b/b), but
          this is not the case (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Indeed, we've observed
          analogous non-additivity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> for each of the three
          heterozygotes, a/b, a<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3/b</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR-L</ENAMEX> for a<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/b</ENAMEX> and
          3/b (data not shown). Since independent isolates of a
          given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> have essentially the same pattern, this is
          unlikely to be caused by different genetic backgrounds.
          Rather, it is possible that this phenomenon indicates
          allelic-interactions, particularly given that the alleles
          are closely associated in a polytene chromosome at the
          time they are processed (homologs are paired in the
          polytene anlage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stichotrichs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] ). For
          instance, transvection is a phenomenon dependent on
          homolog pairing; transvection normally is evidenced by
          rescued gene expression in heterozygotes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles
          defective in different 
          cis -acting sequence features,
          which interact (in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> ) to essentially complement
          one another (review: [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] ).
          Whatever the explanation of this complexity, it does
          not negate the conclusion that the patterns are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genotype-sensitive</ENAMEX> and that 
          cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> must be
          operating in the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>. Thus, even
          if alleles interact to determine the TAS pattern,
          nonetheless the alleles are determining the pattern -
          that is, the patterns are determined by 
          cis -acting components of the
          allele sequences. The results suggest that allelic
          sequences predominantly determine TAS positions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autonomously</ENAMEX> (additively), but the non-additivity results
          indicate that the allele sequences must also interact in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> .
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> multi-TAS regions roughly lie between their
          neighboring genes' coding regions, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> site
          interrupts the common region transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>

          The CR-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> multi-TAS region of

          shown along side the images of their respective lanes.
          Furthermore, these clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> patterns are displayed in

          technique of "telomere step-in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>." In this procedure,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is performed with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P1</NUMEX>-anchor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product as
          template, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P1</ENAMEX> in combination with an oligomer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          telomere repeats (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">termini</ENAMEX> "shift" down by a predicted size decrement,
          thereby verifying each responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX>. Note essentially
          all the bands in the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>" display shift down in concert,
          including the extremely slow band, a marked short-chain
          triplet, and the marked shortest-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. The
          significance of the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> position represented by
          the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> will be considered below.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the positions of detected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX> mapped
          onto the sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> alleles of the CR-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> multi-TAS
          region. Homologous nucleotides are aligned. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty six</NUMEX>
          positions are used as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>. As the displays indicate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), uses of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are influenced by the
          allele sequence. Illustrating that allele-specific 
          cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> must dictate
          TAS-position use, alleles differ at most TAS positions:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> are used by all alleles; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> positions (†-marked)
          are used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>, but not all alleles, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          positions (*-marked) are used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> allele.
          For instance, note the most CR-proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA TAS</ENAMEX>, only
          mapped to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O. fallax 3.5 vA</ENAMEX>; it resides in a
          segment of highly conserved sequences, with the exception
          of a vA-specific dT <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 nts 5</ENAMEX>' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX>. Might this
          single mutation have caused the use of this unique TAS
          position? Given the interactions between alleles we
          observe in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> trifallax data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it may
          be that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vA TAS</ENAMEX> might not be dictated by a vA sequence
          feature acting in 
          cis , but could have been induced
          on vA by the vB and/or vC alleles also present in the
          anlage that established strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> macronuclei. This vA
          segment is immediately 5' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Region</ENAMEX> gene's
          transcription start sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] ), and
          presumably is conserved by selection focused on
          expression of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 54 63</NUMEX> ] .
          The position of this most-proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vA</ENAMEX> is
          surprising, indicating that some <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">vA MAC I or II</ENAMEX>
          chromosomes have as few as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-5</ENAMEX> base pairs between the
          telomere <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the transcription start site of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Region</ENAMEX> gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] ). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of
          possibilities are that these chromosomes cannot express
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Region</ENAMEX> gene for lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX>,
          or that they do, noting that the use of this verified TAS
          is genetically dictated, and hence is tested for fitness
          by natural selection. Thus, if the CR genes are silenced
          on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close</NUMEX>-trimmed chromosomes, the implication is
          that generation of these chromosomes with inoperative
          genes is somehow useful to 
          Oxytricha , perhaps adjusting the
          stoichiometry of expressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-locus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Alternatively these chromosomes may be able express
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Region</ENAMEX> gene, despite the extreme lack of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Assuming that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> element is
          required and is not provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5 bp 5</ENAMEX>' of the
          transcription start, perhaps the telomere repeats serve
          this purpose (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] ). It is also possible that a
          promoter element resides internal to this region: we have
          identified a highly conserved sequence block in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron and suggested that it might serve as
          a promoter element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] .
          Perhaps the most trivial interpretation of the
          existence of these short chromosomes is that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsible TAS</ENAMEX> is positioned due to a recent mutation
          that arose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vA allele</ENAMEX>, subsequent to its relatively
          recent divergence from vC [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] ; thus, the mutation is
          relatively new, and despite its potential impairment of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> gene on these short chromosomes, the mutation may
          not yet have been expunged by selection.
        
        
          Single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> regions, distal to the left and right
          arms of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> locus
          In contrast to the multi-TAS regions bounding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Region</ENAMEX>, telomeres are added to single positions at
          the extreme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal boundaries of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> locus.
          Figure 5presents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM-PCR</ENAMEX> displays in which both the
          left-arm- and right-arm-distal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> regions show single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX>, "step-in" verified. An exception is the triple
          band for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>arm-distal region of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> fallax <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>. A more complete
          study of single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> will be presented elsewhere
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.R.W.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.G.D., D.J. Witherspoon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.A.H.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
          preparation). Clones of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bands have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.R.W.</ENAMEX>, unpubl. results), showing that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bands represent the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> versions/alleles of this
          locus, each of which has a different TAS. Sequence
          differences that might be responsible for the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TAS</ENAMEX> locations are not obvious.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct processes are determined by 
        cis -acting sequences. First, 
        cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> must determine
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> regions only generate single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>,
        while the common-region boundaries each generate multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>. Below we propose that the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are
        the sites for binding or cutting by the chromatid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binder/cutter.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we show that the heterogeneity of
        TAS positions within the CR-bounding multi-TAS regions are
        genetically determined: the pattern is not random but
        reproducible from karyonide to karyonide, and it is
        allele-specific, indicating that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> in these regions
        is dictated by its own 
        cis -acting sequence, which we model
        below as a pause site for an exonuclease that resects the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">new MAC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end</TIMEX> before telomerase can act.
        By trying to explain why alternatively- or
        incompletely-cut TAS regions are also multi-TAS regions,
        while completely-cut positions have a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX>, we have
        attempted to infer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -acting machinery that works at
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Toward that we now present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> models
        involving a set of 
        cis -acting sequences and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -acting components.
        A series of assumptions has been made, some of which
        will be examined after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are presented, as we
        consider alternative explanations. First, we assume the
        previous model for alternative processing, that the CR
        boundaries are not efficiently broken on each chromatid,
        sometimes leaving the common region linked to a left or
        right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . We assume three 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -acting components and three
        kinds of 
        cis -acting sites. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> assumed are a loose,
        non-covalent complex between the binder/cutter enzyme and
        telomerase, and a resecting exonuclease that pauses. The
        assumed 
        cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are the binding,
        cutting and exonuclease-pause sites. Finally, we assume
        that enzyme can act either coupled to the binder/cutter
        action or on its own at ends exposed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exonuclease</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> model is what we take to be the accepted model
        in the field for chromatid breakage and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">telomere</ENAMEX> formation
        at a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX>, and what we propose also to be the
        mechanism operating at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal single-TAS regions.
        In this case all the components function with full
        efficiency: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, a complex of telomerase and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binder/cutter</ENAMEX> bind to the binding site, then cutting of the
        cut-site ensues with immediate, coupled telomerase capping
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>-destined end, with no interposed erosion.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> further, alternative, mechanisms are offered to
        generate the spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX> at the CR boundaries. These
        models share several features. Each is a kinetic,
        chain-of-events scenario. Each invokes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-maximal</ENAMEX>, or
        weak 
        cis -acting sequence (compared to
        that at a single-TAS <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>) as the cause of the ensuing
        events, and in each enzyme is portrayed anthropomorphically
        for heuristic and didactic reasons.
        In the "hesitant cutter" model, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> binds, but
        the endonuclease is slow to cut, because the cut-site is
        weak (recalcitrant to cutting). Meanwhile the "impatient"
        telomerase dissociates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and while it is
        away from the site, the cutter finally cuts, and the raw
        end is not capped and is exposed to the exonuclease, which
        progresses in fits and starts, stalling at each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX>. When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomerase</ENAMEX> eventually acts, it usually encounters the
        eroder paused at a pause site and adds telomeric repeats to
        those resected chromatid ends, thus generating the
        reproducible spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX> observed.
        In the "frustrated telomerase" model, the cut-site is
        normal, but, instead, the binding site is weak, so that the
        complex binds, but with a high off-rate. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
        events, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> binds transiently and cuts, and
        dissociates from the binding site, removing telomerase
        before it can cap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new end</TIMEX>. As in the previous scenario,
        exonuclease erodes the end and pauses, telomerase returns
        and caps the ends it finds, and the observed spectrum of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX> is generated. In principle, the binding- and cut-sites
        might be coincident or overlap, as for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX> restriction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] ; in that case, cutting would destroy the
        binding-site and this frustrated-telomerase situation would
        apply. This predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple TASs</ENAMEX> should result, even
        at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS</ENAMEX> region with an optimal binding and cut-site, but
        this is contrary to the behavior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-distal TAS
        regions. Further, 
        Euplotes binding- and cut-sites do
        not overlap [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        A central and potentially contentious assumption in
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> weak-sites <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is that telomerase is capable
        of acting independently of the binder/cutter, that is,
        outside the widely inferred complex. However, the ciliate
        literature is unclear about whether 
        Tetrahymena telomerase might be able
        to act uncoupled from the action of the binder/cutter (see
        Introduction). Furthermore, the 
        in vitro exconjugant enzyme of 
        Euplotes crassus can cap
        non-telomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, aided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chromosome Healing Factor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        ] . That 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euplotes</ENAMEX> is more closely related to 
        Oxytricha than to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> tentatively supports our
        assumption that telomerase can heal ends well after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binder/cutter</ENAMEX> has acted. In support of this, we note that
        the level of telomerase activity must be much higher in the
        
        Oxytricha anlage than in the 
        Tetrahymena anlage, in that the
        density of broken ends would be, all else being equal,
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100×</NUMEX> higher (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ends/kbp in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxytricha</ENAMEX> MIC DNA 
        vs . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> ends/kbp in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> ).
        Might telomerase nuclease activity be the cutter [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 43</NUMEX>
        ] ? If so, obviously the cutter and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">telomerase</ENAMEX> cannot
        physically dissociate. The weak-sites models invoke
        dissociation, specifically to explain the correlation
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the boundaries of the CR:
        their partial cutting, and their broad distribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>. Thus, we argue that the cutter (and binder)
        activities must reside in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomerase</ENAMEX>. Also arguing against both activities being in
        one inseparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is the apparent erosion interposed
        between cutting and telomerase action. Specifically,
        erosion requires that nuclease activities have access to
        the ends of the break.
        Might the telomerase endonuclease activity erode the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        ends? This nuclease clips <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' tails that protrude beyond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> template
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAACCCCAAAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . While many (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TASs</ENAMEX>
        in the CR-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> multi-TAS <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'dT's, which could pair
        with template As, several cannot, specifically the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> dAs
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> dCs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In any case, telomerase 
        in vitro requires that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' primer
        end protrudes on a single-strand tail (review: [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ).
        Thus another activity is required to resect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        underhanging strand (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] ), and this enzyme too
        would need access to the break. A variety of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-3'
        exoncleases are known in eukaryotes (review: [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] ), so
        it is reasonable to assume such an activity operates during
        macronuclear development.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CR boundaries share the
        property of being multi-TAS regions, in contrast to the two
        arm-distal regions. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> correlate with the
        previously-inferred incompleteness of chromatid cutting
        that occurs in each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. 
        Cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> must dictate
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contrasting behaviors of the chromatid-breakage
        and telomerase activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproducibility</ENAMEX> and sensitivity
        to allele sequence show that the positions within multi-TAS
        regions also are dictated by 
        cis -acting sequences. The proposed
        weak-sites models make several predictions. We predict that
        a loose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> will be found in ciliates between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomerase</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>-directed binder-cutter activity. In 
        Oxytricha , other alternatively
        processed loci like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> should have multi-TAS
        regions that define the boundaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> between different-sized chromosomes; we are
        searching for such loci in a growing data set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX>
        chromosome end-sequences being generated in collaboration
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Weiss</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Dunn</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Utah Genome Center</ENAMEX>. We
        have begun to examine this data-set for TAS-adjacent
        sequence motifs that potentially define the binding-sites
        and/or cut-sites of single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAS MAC</ENAMEX> ends, as Klobutcher 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] have done for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. crassus</ENAMEX> . We can then test the
        prediction that multi-TAS regions bear either weak binding-
        or cut-sites. Finally, we are expanding our data set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allelic</ENAMEX> and orthologous variants of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> multi-TAS
        regions, to be able to infer the identity of their 
        cis -acting pause site sequences. As
        the details of multi-TAS region processing unravel, we
        should be able to illuminate the processes of chromatid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breakage</ENAMEX>, and healing by telomerase.
