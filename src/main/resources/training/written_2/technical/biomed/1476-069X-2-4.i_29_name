        Generally, the benefits of energy efficiency programs
        are expressed in terms of the economic payback that will
        accrue for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. To introduce
        environmental benefits into this framework, some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have quantified the emission reductions
        related to the decreased use of electricity and fossil fuel
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , including criteria air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> and greenhouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>. While these analyses are useful, they provide only a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> set of information, as issues such as pollutant
        fate and transport or pollutant toxicity are omitted,
        making environmental and economic endpoints
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incomparable</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Multiple</ENAMEX> studies have developed models to estimate the
        health impacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, using a
        risk-based approach to link emissions of key pollutants
        with dispersion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and health evidence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        While this is a valuable approach, it can be difficult to
        apply in the case of broad-based energy efficiency
        programs, as these programs tend to affect multiple sources
        simultaneously (e.g., numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, all
        power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> on the grid). Quantifying the health benefits
        of energy efficiency programs therefore requires a
        simplified approach toward risk calculations, with adequate
        characterization of uncertainty to aid in the
        interpretation of the findings.
        In a recent investigation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , we developed a model
        to predict the public health benefits of increased
        residential insulation in new housing, related to the
        emission reductions of fine particulate matter (PM 
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> ) and its precursors (nitrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>). We determined that increasing
        insulation from current practice to the latest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Energy Conservation Code</ENAMEX> (IECC <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) levels
        for all single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> built from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001 to 2010</TIMEX> would
        save <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 TBTU</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 10</ENAMEX> 14British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermal Units</ENAMEX>) during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year period</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBTU</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> housing output per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>). Linking this evidence with estimated emission
        reductions, extrapolated results from dispersion model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outputs</ENAMEX> and epidemiological evidence, we concluded that the
        resulting public health benefits would include
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60 fewer</NUMEX> deaths, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attacks</ENAMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> fewer restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> within this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decade</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> deaths, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attacks</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> restricted
        activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> reduced per year for all new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> built in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        Although this investigation demonstrated that a
        risk-based methodology for demand-side management programs
        is viable and provided a crucial foundation for policy
        analysis, interpretation was impaired by the relatively
        narrow focus. For example, the new housing market
        represents only a small fraction of the potential public
        health benefits of insulation in the residential sector.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.2 million</NUMEX> new single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>
        built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but the existing housing stock
        consists of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 75 million</NUMEX> single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, it would be anticipated that there is greater
        per unit potential for energy savings in existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX>,
        given many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> built prior to the promulgation of energy
        codes that therefore contain relatively less insulation
        than newer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
        In spite of the anticipated greater energy savings of
        the existing versus new housing market, the relative public
        health benefits will not necessarily be proportional.
        Because the geographic distribution of housing starts
        differs from the distribution of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, geographic
        patterns of energy savings will differ. There are regional
        differences in population density and meteorological
        patterns, both of which will influence the magnitude of
        health benefits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> also differ both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regionally</ENAMEX> and by age of home, which will strongly
        influence emissions. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we apply our risk model
        to the existing single-family home market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> to evaluate the following questions:
        - What are the magnitude and distribution of public
        health benefits associated with hypothetically retrofitting
        single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> with insulation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IECC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> levels
        when necessary?
        - How does the economic value associated with these
        public health benefits compare with the economic savings
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>?
        - In general, how uncertain are public health benefit
        estimates derived from simplified models, and what are the
        major contributors to that uncertainty?
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Savings</ENAMEX>
          To quantify the energy savings associated with
          insulation retrofits in existing single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, we
          use a regression-based approach to simulate energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> in a number of prototype <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and apply those findings to the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> where
          insulation retrofits were deemed plausible. The first
          step was to determine the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in each state
          that likely require increased insulation. Using
          information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Residential Energy Consumption</ENAMEX>
          Survey (RECS) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , we estimated the total number of
          homes by state in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX> also provided the percentage
          of single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> by census <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, yielding an
          estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74 million</NUMEX> single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continental US</ENAMEX>.
          We used the qualitative characterization of insulation
          levels by age of home within an earlier version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] to determine the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> where
          insulation retrofits were viable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homes</ENAMEX> that were well
          insulated were assumed to not require additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insulation</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> with adequate or poor insulation
          were assumed to require more insulation. On average, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>
          of single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> had adequate or poor insulation.
          Lacking geographically resolved information on this
          parameter, we assumed that this percentage applied to all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, yielding the number of target single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>
          at a state level (and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 46 million</NUMEX> homes
          nationally). It should be noted that an assumption of
          geographic uniformity stratified by age of home yielded
          essentially identical estimates (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South-Atlantic</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>, with census
          divisions defined as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), so this is unlikely to
          contribute to significant uncertainty in the
          analysis.
          To quantify energy consumption under current
          conditions and given insulation increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IECC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
          levels, we applied regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> we developed
          originally for our new housing investigation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . We
          simulated prototype single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in a number of
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and applied the energy model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM/Design</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Architectural Energy Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boulder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>) to
          estimate energy consumption given home configuration,
          climate, and insulation levels. We gathered current
          practice insulation levels (in ceiling, wall, and floor)
          from an earlier energy analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , which assumed
          existing home insulation levels to be uniform within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">census</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IECC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> insulation levels [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] are based on heating degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> rather than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> region and are represented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          In addition, window types (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal versus wood</ENAMEX>), door
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX>, and shading factors varied by region. Selected
          home characteristics as well as heating and cooling
          system features were assumed to be uniform nationally.
          This included unconditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX>, exposed ducts, an
          infiltration rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67</NUMEX>, a heating set point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          degrees C (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">68 degrees</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>), and a cooling set point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          degrees C (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 degrees</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). Remaining home characteristics,
          including floor area, heating types, and number of
          stories by region, were gathered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Additional specifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or heating and cooling
          system characteristics are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          upon request.
          To ensure that the regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> represented the
          physical realities of heat transfer, the functional form
          of our regressions and the covariates selected were based
          on standard heat loss equations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . For example,
          space heating energy consumption was predicted as a
          function of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two covariates</NUMEX> - the product of heating
          degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and floor area, and the product of heating
          degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, floor area, and an expression reflecting the
          amount of insulation in the ceiling, walls, and floor (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>). Finally, we calibrated the outputs from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> against reported energy consumption
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX> to better reflect actual consumption
          patterns.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emission Reductions</ENAMEX>
          Given state-level energy savings by fuel type, we
          estimate emissions of primary PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (as a precursor of sulfate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX> (as a precursor of nitrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>). This choice was based on the findings of past
          studies, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> contributed the vast majority of
          benefits [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . As might be anticipated, our
          procedure to model emissions differs for direct
          residential fuel combustion and electricity. We summarize
          our approach below and refer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to our earlier
          analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] for more detail.
          For direct residential fuel combustion, given the fuel
          type (natural gas or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel oil</ENAMEX>), we estimate emissions
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-42 database prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . For
          fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, emissions of both SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> are given as a function of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> content in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. Although the sulfur
          content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel oil</ENAMEX> can vary somewhat on a state-by-state
          basis, lacking detailed information, we assumed that a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> content by weight was applicable nationally,
          as has been done previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          On the other hand, for electricity, we needed to
          determine which power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> would be affected by
          marginal decreases in electricity consumption, since it
          is likely that the marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> are not identical to
          the average <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>. In our earlier
          analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , we concluded that only non-combined
          cycle fossil-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 80%</NUMEX> capacity
          factors were likely to be influenced by small demand
          changes in the near term, as any base load <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> running
          at high capacity or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with supply-related constraints
          (e.g., nuclear, hydroelectric) could not respond to these
          changes. We applied these screening criteria to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Emissions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Resource Integrated Database</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-GRID</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] to determine a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">553</NUMEX> power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>
          potentially able to respond to demand-side management
          efforts. Without a detailed simulation of the electricity
          sector, it is impossible to determine precisely which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> would respond on the margin. For our central
          estimate, we assumed that each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> with positive net
          generation was equally likely to be affected, regardless
          of capacity or relative availability. It should be noted
          that this assumption resulted in lower emission rates
          than a capacity- or availability-based allocation,
          potentially biasing our estimates downward. The magnitude
          of this effect is considered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
          To link this information with electricity savings at
          the state level, we first quantified emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX> and
          SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> per unit output for each power plant
          using data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-GRID</ENAMEX>. Since primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PM</ENAMEX> emissions were
          not incorporated into E-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRID</ENAMEX>, we estimated PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> emissions using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-42 emission
          factors for PM 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (given power plant characteristics)
          and estimates of the PM 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2.5 /PM</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> emissions ratio. We used this
          information to determine emission factors by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Electricity Reliability Council</ENAMEX> (NERC) region,
          and determined state-level emission factors based on the
          proportion of electricity consumption provided by each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NERC</ENAMEX> region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Exposure Reductions
          As alluded to above, a critical (and difficult) step
          in accurately quantifying the health benefits of
          demand-side management efforts involves linking emissions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> to exposure reductions, given the substantial
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and limited capacity of fate and
          transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Recently, the risk assessment and
          atmospheric modeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have recognized the
          importance of developing approaches to extrapolate
          estimates from other studies in situations where input
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are limited or comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are impractical.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Multiple</ENAMEX> studies have developed and applied a concept
          known as an intake fraction, generally defined as the
          fraction of a pollutant or its precursor emitted that is
          eventually inhaled by someone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mathematically,</ENAMEX>
          an intake fraction can be calculated using the following
          equation:
          
          where 
          iF = intake fraction; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BR</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-average breathing
          rate (assumed to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 m 3/day</NUMEX>); 
          C 
          
            i 
           = incremental concentration of pollutant at receptor
          
          i (Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/m 3</ENAMEX>); 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">=</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at receptor 
          i ; Q = emission rate of pollutant
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pollutant precursor (Î¼g</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>). If the health effect in
          question has a linear dose-response function with no
          threshold above current ambient concentrations, an intake
          fraction provides an estimate directly interpretable from
          a health perspective (since the health impacts will be
          proportional to the sum of the product of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
          concentration).
          To apply the intake fraction concept in our
          investigation, we used predictive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">regression</ENAMEX> models
          developed in a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This study took its
          intake fraction estimates from an analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] that
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CALPUFF</ENAMEX> (a regional-scale Lagrangian puff model) to
          calculate intake fractions for primary PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , sulfate particles (from SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), and nitrate particles (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>),
          evaluating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX> power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mobile sources
          distributed across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. In general, the intake
          fractions were strongly predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> variables
          (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 or 1000 km</NUMEX> of a source),
          stack height (for primary PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> from power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>), and
          miscellaneous meteorological terms (including annual
          average temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, or
          mixing height).
          To apply these regressions to the power sector, we
          determined the values of the appropriate covariates for
          each marginal power plant identified above, resulting in
          intake fraction estimates for each of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">553</NUMEX> power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
          To assign a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> intake fraction for
          electricity savings in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, we weighted the
          plant-level intake fractions by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> within NERC
          region and averaged across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NERC</ENAMEX> regions in proportion to
          electricity transmission patterns. For residential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, we assumed that the mobile source
          intake fraction estimates were applicable (given
          emissions at or near ground level) and calculated intake
          fractions for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Statistical Area</ENAMEX> (MSA)
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. State-level intake fractions were then
          estimated as a weighted average of MSA-level intake
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX>, weighting by number of homes.
          It should be noted that, in addition to the
          uncertainties associated with the regression model, there
          are overarching uncertainties associated with the
          application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALPUFF</ENAMEX>. For example, although it is well
          established that changes in SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> can influence nitrate
          particle concentrations by affecting available ammonia
          levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALPUFF</ENAMEX> does not capture this phenomenon
          for an analysis of a small subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The
          importance of this effect and related model uncertainties
          are considered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Discussion</ENAMEX> section.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health Benefits</ENAMEX>
          As in our past investigation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , we quantify
          mortality and selected morbidity benefits associated with
          incremental reductions in PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> exposures. Premature mortality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with PM 
          2.5 has typically dominated public
          health benefits when health endpoints were placed in
          economic terms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] , but we include some morbidity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> to illustrate outcomes with varying severity.
          Although excluding the complete array of morbidity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> will result in a systematic underestimation of
          benefits, we adopt this approach for the sake of brevity.
          As mentioned above, given the framing of our analysis, we
          determine reasonable central estimates for
          concentration-response functions and consider the
          magnitude of the uncertainty in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
          For premature mortality, we derive our central
          estimate from a follow-up analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> cohort study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . This investigation followed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> across a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-year</TIMEX>
          period, evaluating mortality risk from air pollution
          while controlling for numerous plausible confounders
          (including smoking, alcohol consumption, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, and occupational exposures). Using pollution data
          averaged across the study period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> report a
          relative risk for all-cause mortality of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.06</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/m 3increase</ENAMEX> in PM 
          2.5 concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.11</NUMEX>). Alternatively, using pollution data from the start
          of the study period, the corresponding relative risk was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.04</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.08</NUMEX>). Based on these estimates and
          given the desire to provide a parallel estimate with our
          earlier investigation to improve comparability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , we
          apply a concentration-response function of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>
          increase in premature deaths per <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/m 3increase</ENAMEX> in annual
          mean PM 
          2.5 concentrations. We consider this
          value to be a plausible central estimate, as it is
          bounded above by the concentration-response function from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Six Cities Study</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and below by values
          from time-series studies.
          As previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , we derive our selected morbidity
          concentration-response estimates from recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>
          benefit-cost analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . This results in an
          estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attacks</ENAMEX> (among
          asthmatics only) and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> increase in restricted
          activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/m 3increase</ENAMEX> in PM 
          2.5 concentrations.
          The application of concentration-response functions as
          described above implicitly assumes that no population
          threshold exists at current ambient concentrations in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and that all forms of particulate matter have
          identical toxicity. The former assumption is bolstered by
          the lack of documented thresholds in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
          ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">time-series</ENAMEX> mortality [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] investigations.
          Consideration of the latter issue is beyond the scope of
          our analysis, other than to state that lacking either
          definitive evidence exonerating selected types of fine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> or quantitative evidence supporting relative
          toxicities, an assumption of equal toxicity is a
          reasonable default for a central estimate.
        
        
          Economic Implications
          Although the economic valuation of health endpoints is
          highly uncertain, we apply the central estimates used in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX> benefit-cost analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] to illustrate
          the potential magnitude of externalities avoided in
          relation to the direct economic savings.
          Based on the findings of a number of labor market and
          contingent valuation studies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX> determined a
          value of statistical life of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
          dollars, which can be translated into an approximate
          value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US dollars</NUMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer</ENAMEX>
          Price Index inflation rates. We apply this value assuming
          a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> lag <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for deaths from cohort
          mortality evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of deaths in each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX> of deaths in the subsequent
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>.
          In the benefit-cost analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          ] , an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attack</ENAMEX> is given a central value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32</NUMEX> (in
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1990 dollars</NUMEX>), based on a willingness to pay study that
          focused on avoidance of a bad asthma day. To our
          knowledge, no willingness to pay study has been conducted
          on restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Given values reported in the
          benefit-cost analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">of $38</ENAMEX>
          for a minor restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (which is more mild
          than a restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$83</NUMEX> for a work-loss
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> (which is presumably more severe than a restricted
          activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), we use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> dollars) as a
          reasonable central estimate. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>, we focus
          on the sensitivity of conclusions to the approach for
          valuation of premature mortality.
          To quantify the incremental cost of insulation, we
          determined the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-value increase in ceiling,
          walls, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, and used this to quantify the
          volume of insulation required per <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, given the square
          footage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and the assumption that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 inches</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass corresponds</ENAMEX> to a unit increment in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-value.
          We quantified the value of insulation in dollars per ton,
          based on the reported value of shipment from the mineral
          wool sector [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and the mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass</ENAMEX> production
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , along with an assumed density of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.06 kg</NUMEX>/in-ft <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> economic savings associated with
          the energy reductions were based on state-level unit
          prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
          . The real prices of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> were assumed to be
          constant over time, given forecasts of relatively small
          price changes in upcoming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . For all net
          present value calculations, we apply a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% real</NUMEX> discount
          rate, the central estimate used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX> benefit-cost
          analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Savings</ENAMEX>
          Prior to calibration, our predictive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">regression</ENAMEX> models
          based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM/Design</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outputs</ENAMEX> systematically overpredicted
          energy consumption as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX>. We considered
          performance stratified by fuel type and combinations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">census</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA; Midwest</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNC; South</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WESC</ENAMEX>;
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Natural gas
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel oil</ENAMEX> consumption were within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of reported
          values in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> but the West, where the regression
          model predicted energy consumption <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> times higher than
          that reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX>. The bias was somewhat greater for
          electricity consumption (a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> higher
          across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> for gas- or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-heated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and a factor
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> higher for electric-heated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>). As
          described in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM/Design</ENAMEX> has
          been shown to somewhat overestimate energy consumption,
          so this performance and the need for a calibration factor
          were anticipated. We calibrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by simply
          multiplicatively scaling the regression results to
          reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECS</ENAMEX> values, stratified by region and fuel
          type.
          According to our calibrated energy model, increasing
          residential insulation in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 million</NUMEX> existing homes
          where insulation retrofits are necessary would save
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">800</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">TBTU</ENAMEX> per year - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMBTU</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          7BTU) per household per year. Of this total, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> is
          related to source electricity savings, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> related
          to natural gas and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> to fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> electricity savings are associated with space
          heating rather than cooling. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five percent</NUMEX> of
          energy savings occurs in electric-heated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, with the
          remainder occurring in gas- or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel oil</ENAMEX>-heated homes
          (either through reduced fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> combustion or reduced
          electricity consumption for space cooling).
          Looking at regional patterns, within electric-heated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70%</NUMEX> of the energy savings are found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>, principally due to the number of electric-heated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> relative to other regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          On a per unit basis, the savings are greatest in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and lowest in the West, related to climate and
          current practice insulation levels. For <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> heated by
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel oil</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, given both the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and the higher per unit energy savings.
          Across all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> types, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> per unit energy savings
          for retrofitting existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately four</NUMEX>
          times greater than the per unit energy savings associated
          with increasing insulation from current practice levels
          in new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IECC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> code levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , a finding
          that agrees with other analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          An evaluation at the state level can provide some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> about differentials in past energy codes as well
          as within<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">-</ENAMEX>region differences that might be important from
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> and exposure perspective. Unsurprisingly,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with the greatest total energy savings
          generally correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with the most
          households - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of the national energy savings (and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>). On a per unit basis, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with the greatest energy savings are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, while the
          smallest per unit savings are seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, a clear indication of
          the importance of climate.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emission Reductions</ENAMEX>
          Given these energy savings, the aggregate emission
          reductions from residential fuel combustion and power
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 3,100 fewer tons</NUMEX> per year of
          PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 fewer tons</NUMEX> per year of

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>,
          the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> are linked to power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> for SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), even though <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 39%</NUMEX> of energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> is related to electricity generation. This can be
          explained by the predominance of natural gas space
          heating, which has lower emissions of all pollutants
          (particularly SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) when compared with electricity
          generation from marginal power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that are often
          fueled by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>.
          When we consider tons of pollutants emitted per unit
          energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">savings</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX>, it is clear that there are
          substantial regional variations in emissions intensity of
          energy consumption (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For primary PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> per unit energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> are similar across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> for residential fuel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX>, but are somewhat greater in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> for electricity. Similarly, for SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the electricity-related emissions
          are greater in other regions than in the West, where a
          greater proportion of electricity available on the margin
          is generated by natural gas. For residential fuel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX>, the emissions intensity for SO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is far lower than that for
          electricity, with the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>, where
          fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> combustion is more prevalent. Finally, the
          emissions intensity patterns for NOx are broadly
          consistent with those for PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , indicating similarities in the
          ratios of emission rates associated in part with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX> temperature and efficiency.
          The rankings of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, both on an aggregate basis and
          on a per unit basis, differ when energy savings are
          translated into emissions reductions. First considering
          aggregate emission reductions, for PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> , the highest-emitting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are
          those larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with substantial electric space
          heating and higher-emitting power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>. The top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          emitting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are identical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
          having the highest emissions of SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>). On a per unit basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> have the
          highest emissions for PM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> having the highest SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> emissions.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health Benefits</ENAMEX>
          Using our intake fraction estimates and
          concentration-response functions for mortality and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">morbidity</ENAMEX>, the emission reductions of particulate matter
          and particle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precursors</ENAMEX> can be translated into health
          benefits. In total, the emission reductions correspond to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> fewer deaths, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6500</TIMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attacks</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110,000</NUMEX>
          fewer restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> per year, spread across
          the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. This represents an approximate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX>
          decrease in rates of the selected mortality and morbidity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. The distribution of mortality benefits by
          pollutant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>,
          with identical patterns seen for the morbidity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> deaths averted, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with reduced sulfate exposures due to SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> emission reductions. This is largely
          due to reduced electricity consumption for space heating
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 34%</NUMEX> of the health benefits
          are related to primary PM 
          2.5 emission reductions, largely due
          to reduced residential fuel combustion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and reduced electricity consumption in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>. Nitrate particles due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions play a
          relatively minor role, contributing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> of total
          benefits.
          Because of differences in regional emissions
          intensities, meteorological conditions influencing
          pollutant fate and transport, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> patterns,
          the distribution of health benefits across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> differs significantly from the distribution of
          energy savings. On a regional basis, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
          provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 39%</NUMEX> of total energy savings, it is
          responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 60%</NUMEX> of public health benefits. In
          contrast, the West provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of total energy savings
          but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> of public health benefits. As shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the relative contributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to energy savings
          versus public health benefits also vary substantially.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> that contribute proportionately more to mortality
          reductions than to energy savings (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>) tend to have significant electric
          space heating with electricity from power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that
          emit higher amounts of SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
          Looking at the benefits on a per capita basis, there
          are significant differences across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in both public
          health and energy savings (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> figures are
          moderately correlated with one another (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX>), with a
          ratio that varies by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> (with a minimum
          mortality reduction per unit energy savings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX> and a maximum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>). This provides tangible
          evidence that one cannot simply calculate public health
          benefits given estimated energy savings, as population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>, climate, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> usage, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> intensities
          significantly affect estimated health benefits.
        
        
          Economic Implications
          In total, the estimated cost of the increased
          insulation is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $37 billion US</NUMEX>, or an average
          of slightly below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800</NUMEX> per existing single-family home
          available for retrofits. The annual economic benefits
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the energy savings are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $5.9</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">billion</NUMEX> per year, indicating a payback period of slightly
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX> (assuming no change in the real price of
          fuel). Since this includes an array of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in different
          regions and with different baseline insulation levels,
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">payback period</TIMEX> clearly varies substantially across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX>. If we apply a real discount rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, then the
          net present value of the economic savings (conservatively
          assuming a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-year lifetime</TIMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>) is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$110 billion</NUMEX>, implying a net economic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> (including the cost of insulation) on the order
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80 billion</NUMEX>.
          When economic values are assigned to the mortality and
          morbidity outcomes as described above, the environmental
          externalities averted through increased insulation amount
          to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $1.3 billion</NUMEX> per year. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of this
          total is related to premature mortality, indicating that
          the assumed value of statistical life is a key parameter
          in this calculation (although not all morbidity outcomes
          were included in our analysis). Adding this quantity to
          the economic savings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> would reduce the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">payback</TIMEX> period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 6 years</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, although this involves combining private and
          public benefits, has a simple characterization of the
          time lag of benefits, and does not include the upstream
          emissions from insulation manufacturing or fuel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX> and processing. Nevertheless, this calculation
          provides a rough indication of the relative magnitudes of
          environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">externalities</ENAMEX> and cost savings.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our analysis has demonstrated that it is viable to
        calculate central estimates for the public health benefits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with reduced residential energy consumption,
        making use of previous dispersion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can provide insight
        about the relative merits of alternative energy efficiency
        policies, as well as allowing for a comparison with source
        controls or other public health interventions. For example,
        our central estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> fewer premature deaths per year
        from retrofitting existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> can be compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>
        fewer premature deaths per year from increasing insulation
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single year</TIMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The ratio between
        these values is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>, which exceeds the energy
        savings ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 130</NUMEX>, illustrating the
        importance of geographic patterns of housing starts. The
        differential between these values clearly demonstrates the
        substantially greater potential in the existing housing
        market, even given the fact that existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> retrofits
        represent a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time" opportunity, while housing codes
        influencing new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> would affect construction over
        multiple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        To provide further context about the magnitude of
        benefits, retrofitting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> today
        would have the same public health benefits as requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IECC 2000</ENAMEX> standards. Given the
        rate of new home construction (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.2 million</NUMEX>
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> per year), this implies that a code change today
        would yield identical annual benefits as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX>
        home retrofit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 5 years</TIMEX>, with identical cumulative
        benefits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 years</TIMEX>. In addition, a recent study estimated
        that requiring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine older</TIMEX> ("grandfathered") coal-fired
        power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> to meet new source standards would
        yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX> fewer premature deaths per year [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] , similar to the benefits of retrofitting all eligible
        existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Cost-effectiveness comparisons with other
        interventions are not very useful, as increased residential
        insulation both reduces aggregate costs (calculated as net
        present value) and health risks, given the boundaries of
        our analysis.
        While these comparisons provide some insight about the
        implications of our analysis, any risk-based calculation is
        deficient without careful quantitative consideration of the
        uncertainties inherent in the estimates. We have deemed a
        formal uncertainty analysis to be beyond the scope of our
        investigation, in part because uncertainties have been
        discussed elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and in part because it is
        difficult to accurately quantify many core uncertainties.
        However, we can use the findings of our analysis to provide
        some qualitative prioritization of future areas of study.
        We summarize the findings of our qualitative uncertainty
        analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, which draws on past damage function
        uncertainty characterization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        First, if the environmental externalities represent the
        endpoint of our analysis, it is clear that resolving
        uncertainties related to mortality will be more important
        than resolving uncertainties related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>. However,
        this is partly dependent on our underlying health and
        valuation assumptions. We have used the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cohort</ENAMEX> mortality
        studies and a value of statistical life (VSL) approach. An
        extreme lower-bound calculation for mortality would first
        focus on the time-series rather than cohort mortality
        evidence. This decision could either be based on the belief
        that there is inadequate evidence of a long-term mortality
        effect (although reliance on cohort evidence has been
        supported elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] ) or the belief that
        long-term effects involve significant lags and near-term
        benefits might therefore dominate externality estimates.
        Given this focus, an additional lower-bound assumption
        would consider a life-year measure more appropriate than a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> measure, with a relatively short longevity loss assumed
        in the time-series studies.
        Using a value from the time-series literature of an
        approximate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> increase in deaths per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3increase</ENAMEX> in
        PM 
        2.5 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 35 36</NUMEX> ] , assuming that each
        time-series death represents a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> life<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year</TIMEX>,
        and using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>'s value of statistical life year of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$360,000</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mortality benefit would be
        decreased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3 billion to $30 million</NUMEX>. In this extreme
        case, mortality still represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> of the benefits
        (albeit with a limited set of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity outcomes</ENAMEX>). With the
        inclusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> outcomes
        (including chronic respiratory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and hospitalizations
        for cardiovascular or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> would
        likely dominate monetized health benefits in this
        scenario.
        Given the magnitude of this change, it is clear that
        improved understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cohort</ENAMEX> mortality findings
        would be paramount in refining the estimates within our
        analysis. Of similar importance would be issues related to
        the relative toxicity of sulfate particles, nitrate
        particles, and primary combustion particles from various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. According to our analysis, a majority of the
        benefits is associated with sulfate particles, indicating
        that alternative sulfate toxicities would strongly
        influence our findings. On the other hand, since nitrate
        particles contribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> of benefits, changes in
        conclusions about nitrate toxicity would not influence our
        aggregate calculations in a substantial way. Appropriate
        economic values for premature mortality would clearly be
        critical as well. However, improved understanding about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cohort</ENAMEX> mortality effects and life-years lost within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies would greatly inform valuation,
        with a significant portion of the remaining uncertainty
        related to a value judgment about whether health outcomes
        should be valued on a life-year lost or willingness to pay
        basis.
        Other significant contributors to uncertainty include
        the intake fraction estimates, the emissions
        characterizations, and the predictive energy models. Given
        the relative importance of SO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, the sulfate
        intake fractions in this region would be most important to
        resolve. A recent analysis found that sulfate intake
        fractions for power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> were similar when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALPUFF</ENAMEX> and an alternative dispersion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were applied [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] , indicating that our estimates may not be
        significantly biased. However, for residential fuel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX>, the uncertainties may be somewhat greater.
        Mobile source intake fractions may not be identical to
        residential intake fractions, and the values applied may be
        underestimates, given the importance of near-source impacts
        and the relatively low geographic resolution of models
        underlying our intake fraction estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The lack
        of characterization of the influence of SO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> on nitrate concentrations
        also contributes uncertainty, although this is likely a
        relatively small bias on an annual average and nationally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> basis.
        Our methods for energy savings and emission reduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX> also contribute uncertainties to the analysis,
        although many of these uncertainties are likely
        insignificant compared to the uncertainties articulated
        above. For example, since our energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were both
        highly predictive of modeled energy consumption and were
        calibrated to reported energy consumption stratified by
        fuel type and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, significant bias is unlikely. This is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the fact that our aggregate energy savings
        estimate is within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the value reported in a similar
        analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , with the difference explained in part by
        differences in the assumed number of homes eligible for
        increased insulation.
        On the emissions side, many uncertainties are difficult
        to quantify, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> does not provide quantitative
        estimates of variability or uncertainty. Our assumption
        about the allocation of electricity reductions across power
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> could have contributed a downward bias, with an
        availability-based allocation increasing benefits to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX>
        fewer deaths per year and a capacity-based allocation
        increasing benefits to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720</NUMEX> fewer deaths per year. This
        could theoretically represent a significant uncertainty,
        and one that could be resolved with more detailed power
        sector models. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> piece of information provides an
        indication that our baseline analysis may be the most
        reasonable depiction of the marginal electricity sector. A
        marginal emissions analysis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Power Pool</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPOOL</ENAMEX>) indicates marginal emission rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MWh of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MWh of SO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , the identical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> as
        our E-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRID</ENAMEX> database. These emission rates are within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
        our baseline values for the NPCC NERC <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (which
        includes both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPOOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>), and are
        substantially lower than the emission rates from the
        availability-based or capacity-based allocation
        schemes.
        A final uncertainty is related to the limited scope of
        our analysis. We focused largely on the PM-related
        mortality benefits of energy savings, but there are clearly
        numerous additional benefits, including reduced greenhouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas emissions</ENAMEX>, health benefits related to other pollutants
        (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity endpoints</ENAMEX>, decreased
        dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> imports, and so forth. Although many of
        these endpoints are difficult to quantify, they clearly
        represent ancillary benefits of energy savings.
        In addition to the analytical uncertainties, there are
        broader limitations in applying our findings for policy
        purposes. As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the lack of formal life
        cycle calculations impairs drawing conclusions about the
        net public health benefits of increased residential
        insulation. However, assuming parallelism with a life cycle
        investigation in new housing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] would imply that the
        public health impacts of increased insulation manufacturing
        would be far less than the public health benefits of
        reduced energy consumption during the lifetime of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>,
        with a payback comparable to the economic payback period of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX>. Furthermore, our analysis represents static
        conditions, although the housing market and emission
        factors from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (among other assumptions) are quite
        dynamic. For example, if regulations were put into place
        restricting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, the public health
        benefits of energy efficiency measures would be reduced. In
        addition, insulation retrofits of this magnitude could have
        significant market influences. Although the energy savings
        only represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of annual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> energy consumption (given
        the focus on only a subset of the residential sector), the
        amount of insulation required is substantially larger than
        the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> insulation market. If all retrofits
        occurred in a relatively short period, this would
        significantly influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> price of insulation. Thus,
        although reduced energy consumption will have long-term
        public health implications, the uncertainties in benefit
        calculations likely increase as a function of time.
        In spite of the uncertainties in our analysis, our study
        provides findings with potential policy implications and
        demonstrates some important methodological advancements in
        quantifying the public health benefits of energy efficiency
        programs. On the former point, although it is clear that a
        regulation mandating energy efficiency retrofits in
        existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> would not be tenable, the magnitude of the
        economic and public health benefits indicates that creative
        public policies to encourage retrofits (e.g., low-interest
        loans or tax deductions) may be warranted. On the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methodological</ENAMEX> side, the application of a regression model
        to estimate energy savings appeared reasonable and
        illustrated the potential for evaluating numerous
        alternative scenarios without extensive simulations. The
        intake fraction methodology yielded exposure estimates that
        were both interpretable from a health perspective and
        implementable for a large-scale energy efficiency program.
        Although further study is needed to reduce some core
        uncertainties within the analysis, the model framework is
        sufficiently flexible to allow for the integration of new
        scientific information.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have developed and applied a model to quantify the
        public health benefits of reduced residential energy
        consumption. Retrofitting existing single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> would yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBTU</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> energy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to net present value economic
        gains of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $80 billion</NUMEX> and public health
        benefits that include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> fewer premature deaths per year.
        While there are substantial uncertainties in many
        components of our health benefits model, our analysis
        demonstrates an approach for integrating environmental and
        public health benefits into energy efficiency policy
        analysis.
