        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Arthritic diseases</ENAMEX> are characterized by a progressive
        loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM), which may ultimately
        lead to frank tissue loss and gross joint damage. The
        conditions under which chondrocytes can be induced to
        replenish or repair a depleted matrix (and thereby prevent
        or slow the disease process) remain unclear. If these
        conditions were known, then in principal one could design a
        therapeutic strategy that takes into account the capacity
        (or absence thereof) for chondrocytes to repair their
        matrix naturally.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> have provided some insights.
        For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-degraded cartilage tissues and cell
        suspensions are frequently employed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> to
        study cartilage metabolism under osteoarthritis-like
        conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] and to assess the efficacy of
        various drug therapies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> signals cells
        via cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to upregulate proteases, matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinases</ENAMEX> and aggrecanase, while downregulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> metalloproteinase inhibition and proteoglycan
        synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The ultimate effect of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> changes include damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>, loss of ECM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (especially proteoglycan), and alteration of the
        normal balance of catabolic and anabolic processes that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulate cartilage ECM</ENAMEX> composition.
        With regard to the repair phase, following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced
        cartilage damage, relatively little is known, but partial
        to complete recovery appears possible [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ] . In studies
        of repair, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> focused on glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
        - an important and abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage macromolecule</ENAMEX> - and
        used histologic, biochemical, and/or radiolabel
        incorporation methods to measure GAG concentration ([<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>])
        and/or GAG synthesis rates at selected time points.
        Although these data suggest that repair might be possible,
        our understanding is limited because of the uncertainty in
        the temporal changes in matrix composition for a given
        sample. This uncertainty is a direct consequence of the
        inherently destructive nature of histologic and biochemical
        methods; these techniques therefore do not permit
        monitoring of the spatial and temporal evolution of matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macromolecules</ENAMEX> within individual samples/<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Having to
        infer temporal spatial information from a cross-section of
        samples confounds efforts to conduct a detailed analysis of
        responses in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX>.
        The delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gadolinium-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging of Cartilage</ENAMEX> (dGEMRIC) method overcomes these
        problems in that it is nondestructive and can be used to
        assess quantitatively the spatial distribution of cartilage
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . We and others previously reported on the
        use of dGEMRIC to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> regeneration in living
        cartilage tissue over time in trypsin-depleted bovine
        cartilage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and in cell-laden polymer matrices (tissue
        engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Those studies clearly
        demonstrated that dGEMRIC is feasible for long-term [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
        monitoring, and that its sensitivity is sufficient to
        permit observation of the spatiotemporal evolution of
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]. Each of those studies began with a homogeneously
        proteoglycan-deficient matrix, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> was replenished
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5- to 8-week</TIMEX> period to levels considered to be
        within the normal range.
        In young bovine articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> (a tissue that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have used to investigate the impact of
        physical and biochemical factors on ECM metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> induces a characteristic spatially
        heterogeneous depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>. This young tissue still
        contains blood vessels, and it is in the perivascular
        regions that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion is most severe. We
        know from studies investigating the recovery of
        trypsin-induced homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion in young bovine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> that the inherent ability of chondrocytes to
        replenish the matrix is relatively uniform [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In the
        present study, we take advantage of the characteristic
        spatial heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion to
        study the relative replenishment rates between regions of
        varying severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion. Accordingly, our goal
        was to use dGEMRIC to determine whether bovine cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explants</ENAMEX> briefly exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> would recover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> at a
        uniform rate, or at a rate that depended on the degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion. Specifically, we sought to
        examine recovery after relatively mild and modest
        degradation - conditions that did not induce a complete
        loss of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Method
        
          Culture and degradation protocols
          Cartilage-bone cores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5mm</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7mm</NUMEX> in diameter were
          harvested from young bovine femoropatellar groove
          articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of slaughter. After
          removing the articular surface, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mm-</NUMEX>thick
          discs were sliced parallel to the articular surface. A
          flat edge was made on some of the discs to ease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> and registration during imaging and analysis.
          The discs were weighed, and then immediately placed in
          2ml sterile culture media in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well culture plates. All
          explants were incubated at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> throughout the study.
          Culture medium was prepared with low-glucose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> medium with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10mmol/l</ENAMEX> HEPES

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Supplements including: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum (GIBCO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l-glutamine</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical</ENAMEX>),

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical</ENAMEX>) were added immediately
          prior to use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> was was collected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> and analyzed
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> release by the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> using purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark chondroitin</ENAMEX> sulfate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX>) as the reference standard.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were cultured in basal media for at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> after harvest. To create samples that have
          heterogeneously-degraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were exposed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistron Biotechnology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pine Brooks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>),
          which was added <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> to the culture medium. Two
          series of experiments were conducted, each with its own
          set of controls. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> series, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 6 days</TIMEX> (incurring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'mild</ENAMEX>' degradation; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at days 6 and 3</TIMEX>, respectively, after harvest,
          such that all samples began the 'recovery phase' on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          after harvest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were cultured in basal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> for the entire experiment. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series,
          samples were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 9 days</TIMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incurred 'moderate</ENAMEX>' degradation. In this group the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for all samples

          started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at 3 days</TIMEX> after harvest, and therefore samples
          began the recovery phase at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 9 or 12</TIMEX> after harvest.
          Again, control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were cultured in basal media for
          the entire experiment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are referred to as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'mild</ENAMEX> controls' or 'moderate controls', according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> series with which they were cultured ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 2</NUMEX>).
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure, the samples were transferred
          to sterile flat-bottomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10mm</ENAMEX> nuclear magnetic resonance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX>) tubes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) that
          were custom cut to a length of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5cm</TIMEX>, where they were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in basal media for the duration of the recovery
          experiment.
          In summary, the experiment comprised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three periods</TIMEX>: an
          initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (before any exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>), an exposure
          period (during which tissue was exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> in
          preparation for the recovery phase), followed by a
          recovery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (during which there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
          present).
        
        
          Imaging protocols
          For imaging, the shortened <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NMR</ENAMEX>/culture tubes were
          joined to full-length NMR tubes via a sterilized rubber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stopper</ENAMEX> inserted into the open ends of both tubes.
          All images were acquired on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bruker 8.45 T</ENAMEX> magnetic
          resonance microimaging system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruker Instruments</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billerica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) with a standard 10mm radiofrequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coil</ENAMEX>. T1-weighted images in the axial orientation with
          respect to explant cylindrical geometry were measured
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> post-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure with either an inversion
          recovery sequence ('mild' series) or a saturation
          recovery sequence ('moderate' series). The saturation
          recovery protocol consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> T1-weighted images
          measured with time-to-repeat times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 75</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">125, 175,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">275, 375, 475, 600, 900</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800ms</TIMEX>. For inversion
          recovery measurements, images were acquired with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          inversion delays of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.3</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66.7</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100, 150, 250,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600ms</TIMEX>. Both pulse sequences used a time-to-echo
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.5ms</TIMEX>, section thicknesses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.5mm</TIMEX>, in-plane
          resolutions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100Î¼m</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> averages, for a total
          imaging time of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 1 hour</NUMEX> per sample.
          Analysis of GAG release throughout these experiments
          suggested that, within the range of sensitivity provided
          by our dimethylmethylene blue assay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> release patterns
          were unaffected by removal from incubation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> to
          room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-6 hours</TIMEX> of imaging each week
          (because all the plugs were out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> for the
          imaging session).
          Tissue T1s without contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> were determined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectroscopically</ENAMEX> using an inversion delay pulse sequence
          with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12</TIMEX> delays ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 to 10s</NUMEX> and a 10mm
          broadband radiofrequency <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. At the conclusion of each
          experimental series, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (one control and one
          treated) were equilibrated in gadolinium-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>,
          then extracted from media and blotted dry, and placed in
          an NMR tube. As had previously been observed, we found
          very little difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX> between samples of the same
          series (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) or across series (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T1</NUMEX> times in the absence of contrast agent
          of samples from the same series were averaged and these
          averages used as the reference tissue T1 for all other
          samples within the same experiment series.
        
        
          Image processing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATLAB</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Math Works</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Natick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used to
          create a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T1</NUMEX> map by curve-fitting each T1-weighted image
          series on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a voxel-by-voxel</NUMEX> basis. T1 maps were then
          processed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> maps with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATLAB</ENAMEX> using equations
          derived from a modified ideal Donnan theory. This dGEMRIC
          method of relating measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] was
          previously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">validated</ENAMEX> and reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 22</NUMEX> ] .
          The mean [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] for a sample at a given time point was
          computed as the mean [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] calculated across all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage-containing</ENAMEX> pixels of the image. The rate of
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] accumulation (i.e. the tissue's recovery rate) was
          calculated as the difference in the mean [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] values at
          specified time points divided by the elapsed time.
          As expected, qualitative assessment of images from
          samples exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exhibited the characteristic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion. In order to
          quantitate objectively the time course of GAG recovery
          relative to the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> maps were
          registered using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Photoshop</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems, Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) in order to allow chosen regions of
          interest to be automatically analyzed across multiple
          images from successive imaging sessions. Registered
          images were segmented so that tissue regions of
          relatively high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, or low [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] were identified in
          images taken after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> of recovery. The [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] and
          location of these pixels were tracked in time. High,
          medium, and low [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] regions of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-week</TIMEX> images were
          discerned according to the following definitions:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pixel assigned to 'high</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GAG</ENAMEX> region if:
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]

          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pixels</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Ã SD 
          all pixels )
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pixel assigned to 'low</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GAG</ENAMEX> region if:

          or regions of a given sample did not change with time.
          This technique analyzed the significance of time as an

        Results
        
          Glycosaminoglycan release into media
          The release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was measured daily
          as a surrogate for monitoring the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure
          and of ECM stability following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> withdrawal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from each series had a small rate of release
          throughout (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4 Â± 0.2</NUMEX> Î¼g/mg initial wet-weight/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>),
          except for a slightly higher release rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.7Â±0.2Î¼g/mg</ENAMEX>
          initial wet-weight/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 2-3 days</TIMEX> after
          harvest. Assuming an initial [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of
          wet-weight, this steady-state release rate corresponds to
          a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/day</TIMEX>.
          As expected, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure period the
          exposed samples lost significantly more GAG than did
          controls, in accordance with the severity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
          exposure. Those in the 'mild' and 'moderate' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> lost
          148Â±49Î¼g and 433Â±98Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>, respectively, as compared with
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 81Â±5Î¼g and 103Â±58Î¼g</TIMEX> lost during the same period by
          the control samples. The GAG release rates never dropped
          to negligible levels during the exposure period,
          indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> was not totally depleted from the
          disks at these exposure levels. Turning to the recovery
          period, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 days</TIMEX> after cessation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure
          the GAG release rates dropped to levels comparable with
          those of control samples. GAG release persisted at this
          level (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3Â±0.1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.5Â±0.3Î¼g/</ENAMEX>mg initial wet-weight/day
          for 'mild' and 'moderate' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively)
          throughout the remainder of the study.
        
        
          Tissue glycosaminoglycan concentration over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>
          Use of dGEMRIC allowed for the actual [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] in the
          tissue to be followed over time. The images of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> samples showed relatively stable [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] over the
          culture period (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a,1c), with the coefficient of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (SD/mean over time) for 'bulk' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> (i.e. GAG
          averaged over the entire cartilage image slice) ranging
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2% to 12%</NUMEX>. One can also see that the bulk [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] was
          considerably different for the 'mild' and 'moderate'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> samples. This is probably a reflection of
          differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> used for each series, a
          conclusion supported by considering measurements made
          before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure on a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">92Â±11mg/ml</ENAMEX>
          for the 'mild' series and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">57Â±6mg/</ENAMEX>ml for the 'moderate'
          series; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> for each). To provide a
          relative reference, the mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of untreated samples
          are represented by the shaded regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a,2b.
          Images of the exposed samples acquired immediately
          following cessation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> revealed a much lower [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
          than the initial values, and the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] in exposed samples
          increased with time of recovery (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>). Over the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-week</TIMEX> recovery period following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure, [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
          increased in all samples exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b,1dand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>

          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). In the 'mild' group
          the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 mg/ml</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>) whereas in the 'moderate'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 Â± 11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>).
          Given the variation in initial [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>], we evaluated the
          percentage degree of recovery only for those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for
          which we obtained an 'initial' image before any exposure
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> 'mild' and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> 'moderate'). In these cases
          the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> of recovery did not reach the
          initial levels. The [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] in the 'mild' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of initial [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.019</NUMEX>) and the 'moderate' group
          reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of initial [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00003</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Regional analysis of glycosaminoglycan
          concentration recovery
          The mean rate of [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] recovery (increase in
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]/time) averaged across all pixels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-degraded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> remained steady throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-exposure culture at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2 mg/ml</ENAMEX> per day
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.2Â±0.9mg/ml</ENAMEX> per day). However, looking specifically at
          the spatial distribution of [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>], considerable
          differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] recovery are clearly evident
          across different regions of the same samples.
          In both the 'mild' and 'moderate' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          heterogeneous degradation patterns prevailed, with
          greatest degradation occurring in perivascular regions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c,1d), although the degradation in the 'moderate'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was more severe and homogeneous than in the 'mild'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (the control images and abundant experience with
          this model system supports the implicit assumption here
          that the initial [before <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1</ENAMEX>] distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX>).
          From a qualitative examination of the recovery images,
          it can also be appreciated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with
          relatively low [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> are also the regions
          that had relatively low [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] at the beginning of the
          recovery period, immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure (Figs
          1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          To examine this observation more quantitatively and to
          assess whether the rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> accumulation were
          correspondingly heterogeneous, we examined separately the
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] accumulation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> 'regions', namely those with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'high'</ENAMEX>, 'medium' and 'low' [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 3</TIMEX> (as specified
          above, under Image processing), which is illustrated for
          one sample in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a. Interestingly, regions of 'low'
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] appeared to recover at the same rate as did regions
          of 'medium' or 'high' [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 2 weeks</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-exposure culture. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 2 weeks</TIMEX> of
          recovery, all regions recovered at a rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-15mg</TIMEX>/ml
          per week. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third week</TIMEX> the recovery patterns for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regions differed significantly ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.001</NUMEX>), with the 'low'
          regions showing negligible [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] accumulation and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'high</ENAMEX>' regions the greatest accumulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3a,3c).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study clearly demonstrates that bovine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage explants</ENAMEX> can, at least partially, recover from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced degradation by synthesizing new GAG but that
        the ultimate rate of recovery may be dependent on the
        degree of initial depletion. By monitoring the spatially
        localized changes in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-week</TIMEX> recovery period,
        we showed that [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] increases significantly with time in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-exposure culture, with the early recovery (first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>) being independent of absolute [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] but the later
        recovery (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third week</TIMEX>) occurring only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> with higher
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>].
        With respect to the spatial heterogeneity in recovery
        rates, we are not aware of any histologic (or other) data
        describing the apparent dependence of the rate of [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
        replenishment on the initial state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>. We
        previously showed that spontaneous recovery from complete
        trypsin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> loss occurs uniformly throughout the
        tissue, showing no significant spatial heterogeneity in
        recovery rates and nearly complete recovery to the initial
        state in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 5 weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Those data suggest
        that the capacity for cells to synthesize new matrix is
        uniform throughout the tissue. Thus, the differential
        response seen here is presumably due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure.
        Here, we consider [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] as a surrogate for defining the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ECM</ENAMEX> state immediately following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure. [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] itself
        is one direct measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In the context of the
        present study, [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] might also serve as a surrogate for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> macromolecules, such as collagen.
        Given the broad spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>, we
        consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the tissue where [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] is more
        severely affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> may also be regions that
        experience greater damage to the collagen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, as
        compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that are more resistant to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">effects of IL-1</ENAMEX>. Our finding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that
        experienced the least recovery were those most severely
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> could be a consequence of these same
        regions sustaining more significant damage to the ECM
        network. This conclusion is consistent with findings
        regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced degradation in rabbits, in which
        recovery rates decreased with apparent severity of
        degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, it is in the latter phase of recovery
        that a discrepancy in recovery rates becomes evident.
        During the early phases of recovery, the rate of [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with the lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] was
        comparable to the rates of recovery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> with the
        highest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]. The mechanism for this heterogeneity is
        unclear. It could be a manifestation of a corresponding
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced changes in chondrocyte
        metabolism or viability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , or it could be a
        manifestation of a corresponding distribution of damage to
        the collagen scaffold, which in turn limits the ability to
        replenish [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]. Kruijsen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] showed that both the
        severity and chronicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced inflammation
        determined the degree of chondrocyte killing in their 
        in vivo murine model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
        Their studies showed that chondrocyte death was most highly
        correlated with the degree of joint inflammation present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis induction</ENAMEX>. That finding suggests that
        sustained exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>, a proinflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, may
        also cause chondrocyte death. However, the fact that the
        early recovery phase in the present study showed no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> makes cell death a less likely cause of
        limited [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">replenishment</ENAMEX>.
        A limitation (and obvious next step) to this study is
        that we do not have independent information about the
        integrity of the collagen matrix. Magnetic resonance
        imaging techniques are actively being developed to image
        the collagen component of tissue, which can be incorporated
        into future studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Human osteoarthritic tissue
        is, by histologic measures, spatially heterogeneous in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> damage and degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteoglycan</ENAMEX> depletion. The
        notion that the differential ability to replenish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> fully
        is related to the differential state of the collagen matrix
        has been suggested by others, based in part on the finding
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion corresponds with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that are
        positive for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">col3/4</NUMEX> epitope, which is indicative of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> damage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 26</ENAMEX> ] . Although we lack specific
        information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the collagen matrix, the
        differences observed in the present study (and, indeed, the
        demonstrated ability to evaluate regional differences in
        response) suggest that dGEMRIC and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> such as
        these may be useful for establishing a better understanding
        of the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> to repair osteoarthritis-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>.
        The rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> replenishment observed in this study
        compares well with published synthesis data. Using sulfate
        incorporation over periods of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 24 hours</TIMEX>, we and
        others have reported sulfate incorporation ratios between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.13nmol/</ENAMEX>mg wet-weight/hour for young bovine
        cartilage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . These incorporation rates imply
        GAG synthesis rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6-13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> per week
        (assuming <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 sulfate</NUMEX> per disaccharide, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">502 g/mol</ENAMEX>
        disaccaride, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.8ml</ENAMEX> tissue water/g wet-weight). By
        comparison, we observed GAG accumulation rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-14mg/ml</ENAMEX>
        per week, as inferred from the change in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]. These
        values also compare well with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-7.3mg/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> per week rates
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> replenishment seen in young bovine cartilage
        explants recovering from trypsin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] . Comparison of these GAG accumulation rates with the
        rate of GAG release into the culture medium clearly
        suggests that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 75%</NUMEX> of the newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> is
        retained by the tissue. (By contrast, in control tissue the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> synthesized is roughly equivalent to the
        amount released into the medium.)
        We do not have the ability to determine the regional
        variations in synthesis and loss. Although we clearly
        observed regional variations in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] accumulation, it is
        important to appreciate that these differences could arise
        by regional differences in synthesis or in loss, or
        both.
        Looking more generally at attempts to evaluate [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]
        recovery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-degraded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, our data are
        consistent with the temporal progression seen in other
        model systems in which recovery occurs and is measurable
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few weeks</TIMEX> after a [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>]-depleting
        intervention. For example, Takegami 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] reported [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] recovery
        in alginate cultures of human intervertebral disc cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-exposed</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.5ng/ml IL-1</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>. During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of post-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-exposure culture, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        observed [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] recovery rates of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/day</TIMEX> with
        very little change in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] observed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third week</TIMEX>,
        when [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] levels reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 85%</NUMEX> of the control level.
        In an 
        in vivo rabbit knee joint subjected
        to intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">articular</ENAMEX> injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page Thomas</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] used SO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> uptake and toluidine blue staining to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observe GAG</ENAMEX> losses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25-60%</NUMEX> in several cartilage sites
        within the knee, with gradual recovery over the subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-4</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arner</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] also examined 
        in vivo GAG synthesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in rabbits following intra-articular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">injections of IL-1</ENAMEX>. Using dimethylmethylene blue assay and
        sulfate incorporation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arner</ENAMEX> found that both single and
        multiple injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> led to an initial depression in
        GAG synthesis rate and a slight drop in tissue [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure. These changes were followed by
        enhanced synthesis (relative to controls), with a
        commensurate increase in tissue [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent 2</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> as the content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> in the tissue approached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> levels. In those 
        in vivo systems it appears that GAG
        loss continues for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-7 days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        This is longer than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 days</TIMEX> seen in the present study
        (in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> loss into the medium returned to control
        levels), and is probably a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> clearing
        more quickly from the 
        in vitro environment.
        Thus, in widely different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> - including that
        reported here - it appears that after an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced
        GAG-depleting intervention tissue can reaccumulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> and
        does so most rapidly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few weeks</TIMEX>. However,
        unlike the study described here, in which both spatial and
        temporal changes in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] were monitored, in the studies
        described above it was not possible to derive more specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> information because the destructive nature of the
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] measurements required that time course information be
        inferred from averages of separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>/samples
        harvested at different time points.
        Our data can also be compared with those from other
        studies in which magnetic resonance methods were used to
        monitor changes in cartilage tissue during culture. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> previously observed spatially uniform recovery of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explants</ENAMEX> following trypsin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> depletion using
        dGEMRIC, with the increases in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] occurring most rapidly
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> and slowing considerably after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] used the same method
        to monitor GAG accumulation in tissue engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX>, and observed relatively steady GAG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire</TIMEX> period, with the bulk of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> occurring at the periphery of the explant. The
        initial state of the cell/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymer</ENAMEX> construct was presumably
        uniform, and the heterogeneous [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] accumulation was
        attributed to differences in the biophysical environment.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Potter</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] observed the growth of
        tissue engineered over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of 4 weeks</TIMEX> using proton NMR
        without any additional contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. The relative changes
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX> times of those studies tracked the histologic
        finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> increased for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 3 weeks</TIMEX> and then
        remained relatively constant. Collectively, those studies
        and the present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> illustrate spatial and temporal
        variations in GAG accumulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX>, treated, and
        tissue engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>. Much work, of course, remains
        if we are to begin to understand the biochemical,
        biophysical, and structural factors that underlie the
        differential behavior. Furthermore, much work remains to
        determine the generalizability of the behavior in these
        model systems involving young tissue to behavior of
        cartilage 
        in vivo in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In the present study we demonstrated that chondrocytes,
        in a matrix degraded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> exposure, partially
        replenished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>, and the most severely degraded regions
        replenished less fully than did other regions. Future
        studies are underway to examine whether heterogeneity in
        replenishment rate is seen in human osteoarthritic tissue.
        The study provides additional evidence that the 
        in vitro dGEMRIC method is a
        practical means for studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> homeostasis and events
        that disturb it. Ultimately, such studies provide the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for evaluating the effects of therapeutic
        interventions on [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>] degradation or regeneration 
        in vitro or 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
