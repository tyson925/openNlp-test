        Cellular events are based on specific inter- and
        intra-molecular interactions of many molecules. To
        experimentally dissect such interactions, it is important
        to maintain as closely as possible the cytosolic
        environment of the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Detergents</ENAMEX> are frequently
        employed to disrupt cells for the demonstration and
        isolation of functionally relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and/or
        to selectively extract certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For example, the
        non-ionic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100, Tween 20</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brij</ENAMEX>, have
        been widely used for histochemical purposes or in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> experiments to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-soluble from
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The latter is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commonly</ENAMEX> referred to as the "cytoskeleton" or "membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skeleton</ENAMEX>" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. During cell activation discrete signaling
        molecules are known to associate with or to disassociate
        from the plasma membrane and both, the cytoskeleton and
        membrane skeleton undergoes significant changes as well [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. For cytochemical purposes, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX>
        cannot be used before cells have been fixed, as non-ionic
        detergent treatment causes removal of the cells from their
        supporting surface (e.g. cover glass). The choice of
        fixative for a particular cytochemical study is often a
        difficult task owing to the limited available information
        about the effects of fixatives on cultured cells.
        Considering their effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, fixatives in
        general can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types: "coagulant" or
        "non-coagulant". Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of fixatives have advantages
        and disadvantages. The coagulant fixatives, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], acetone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], and
        trichloroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 12</TIMEX>], denature and precipitate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. These fixatives stop biological reactions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instantaneously</ENAMEX> and presumably leave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in their
        original locations. Due to extraction of membrane
        structures by such fixatives it is not necessary to add
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> during staining with membrane impermeable probes
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. However, the denaturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        seen with these fixatives has disadvantages for some probes
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 12</ENAMEX>] and for visualizing intact cell surfaces.
        Moreover, it is not known if and to what extent proteins
        are lost during specimen preparation for microscopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> (e.g. during incubation or washing procedures).
        The non-coagulant fixatives are mainly chemical
        crosslinkers that include glutaraldehyde, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>,
        acrolein, and dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate). They are
        used to preserve surface morphology of cells and to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immobilize</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> before extraction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 13, 14</ENAMEX>]. However, excess crosslinking
        frequently masks binding domains for probes while
        inadequate fixation may not preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to leave
        them susceptible to mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> during specimen
        processing. The latter is quite critical especially to
        preserve fine and fragile cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microextensions</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filopodia</ENAMEX> or retraction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>].
        We have been interested in the formation and function of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microextensions</ENAMEX> because of their dynamic and universal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, and since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">moesin</TIMEX>, an actin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin-binding
        activity of moesin is regulated by both phosphorylation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphoinositides</ENAMEX> (PIPs) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> could
        be substituted for by a cationic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>,
        dodecyltrimethylammonium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (DOTMAC) 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. This result was
        consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">biochemical</ENAMEX> extraction studies, since
        phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moesin</ENAMEX> specifically co-sedimented with
        DOTMAC-, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-resistant components, most
        likely because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> interfered with the interaction
        between moesin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. This result also suggested
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> extraction of cells may not preserve
        moesin-actin filament <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        As expected, we show here that some of microextensions
        were fragmented by the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X</ENAMEX>-100
        permeabilization method. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> completely
        extracted membrane lipids while maintaining the
        cytoskeleton of microextensions.
        We also observed microextensions having a considerably
        smaller diameter from those commonly seen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX> Î¼m vs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼m</ENAMEX>). Referred to here as ultramicroextensions, these
        extended from cell bodies and grew out from the tips of
        other microextensions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> treatment exposed and
        stabilized their cytoskeleton as well.
      
      
        Results
        
          Examination of microextensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NIH3T3</ENAMEX> fibroblast
          by scanning electron microscopy
          We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIH3T3 cells</ENAMEX> because their morphology and
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoskeletal proteins</ENAMEX> including actin,
          tubulin, vinculin, and moesin have been extensively
          investigated using various fixatives. When removed from
          stock cultures with trypsin and inoculated into
          coverslip-containing dishes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells readily
          attached to the serum-coated substrate, began to spread
          and flattened within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> (data not shown).
          Consistent with the report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajaraman et al.</ENAMEX>[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] on
          human diploid WI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albrecht-Buehler</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3T3</TIMEX> fibroblasts, microextensions
          appeared within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> after seeding. Initially during
          spreading, the cells lost microvilli from their upper
          cell surface and formed microextensions with a diameter
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.2 Î¼m</NUMEX> and a maximal length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 Î¼m</NUMEX>.
          Subsequently, the cells continued to spread and to
          randomly elongate microextensions up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼m</NUMEX>. However,
          closer examination of the fixed cells with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60Â°</NUMEX> tilt
          angle showed numerous additional protrusions extending
          from the cell body with a diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only about 0.05 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were not observed in cells
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior to 12 hours</TIMEX> after inoculation. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hour</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5%</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/130</NUMEX>) of the cells had extended such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that
          usually were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.5</NUMEX> Î¼m in length, and rarely exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼m.</ENAMEX> Because of these unique features, we will use the
          term ultramicroextensions. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days</TIMEX> after reaching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confluency</ENAMEX> (at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about one week</TIMEX> in culture), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of
          the surface of the cells was covered with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, D,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). When cells were
          inoculated at high density, ultramicroextensions appeared
          earlier, but ultramicroextensions were rarely seen even
          after incubation for prolonged periods in sparse cultures
          or when the cells did not make contact (data not shown).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX> originated either from
          microextensions of neighboring cells or from tips of
          other microextensions in a broom-like fashion (Figure
          1G). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX> also originated from the cell
          surface similar to microvilli (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1H</NUMEX>), or as branches
          from other microextensions and ultramicroextensions
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1I</NUMEX>). Identical results were obtained when the
          cells were grown on poly-L-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lysine</NUMEX>-coated coverslips (data
          not shown).
        
        
          Exposure of cytoskeleton in microextensions and
          ultramicroextensions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> extraction
          Fixation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> followed by extraction with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> is a fairly standard method for
          immunofluorescence microscopy of cells, but
          microextensions were fragmented and sometimes even lost
          during this treatment as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, A,B,C. an
          alternative method, we extracted cells also with DOTMAC
          and discovered that fixation and extraction with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0 %</NUMEX>
          PFA<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.5 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>(+) on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, followed by
          fixation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> min
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> method), preserved not only micropodia (white
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2F</ENAMEX>), but also microvilli (black
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>, Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Eand 2F</ENAMEX>), and ultramicroextensions (white
          arrowhead, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>). This treatment extracted lipids
          (data not shown) and exposed cytoplasmic filaments giving
          origin to ultramicroextensions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>). At the cell
          edge the ultramicroextensions are derived from a deeper
          cytoskeletal meshwork (white arrowhead, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>) rather
          than from thick cytoskeletal filaments.
          We have performed ultrastructural analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> of
          cells fixed and/or extracted by the methods listed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. When the cells were treated with coagulant
          fixatives, the cytoskeleton was apparently exposed, but
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at the edge of the cells
          were not preserved as well as those prepared by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> method (data not shown). When the cells were
          extracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> or saponin after
          relatively weak fixation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> apparently was lost, fragmented, or scraped
          off depending on the concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> and the
          period of incubation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Too high a concentration
          of glutaraldehyde or incubation for extended period of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, did not allow to
          expose the cytoskeleton (data not shown).
        
        
          Comparison of different fixation/extraction methods
          for preservation and fluorescence labeling of
          microextensions
          We also compared the different fixation and extraction
          procedures listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> with respect to fluorescence
          intensity and labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actin stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and
          microtubules, and with respect to morphological
          preservation of cells and microextensions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          latter was also assessed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> micrographs before and
          after preparation for fluorescence microscopy and these
          results are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> as well.
          Staining of actin and tubulin filaments differed
          depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and on the fixative. Among the
          coagulant fixatives, acetone produced the best results
          with respect to preservation of microextensions, staining
          of actin with either phalloidin or with monoclonal
          Î²-actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and staining of microtubules with a
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Î²</ENAMEX>-tubulin reagent. After <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> or
          ethanol fixation, some cells were partially detached and
          changed their shape, but this did not occur with other
          coagulant fixatives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acetone</ENAMEX> also provided good
          preservation of microextensions even after preparing the
          cells for immunolabeling, whereas some of the
          microextensions were lost, when cells were fixed with
          other coagulant fixatives (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Fixation with chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crosslinkers</ENAMEX>, followed by
          extraction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> or organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>, are
          standard procedures for preparing cells for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX>. First, we investigated effects on the
          preservation of microextensions by variations in
          detergent concentration and time of incubation with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>. As summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, with shorter time
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of fixation and with higher detergent
          concentrations more cells lost microextensions. For
          example, when cells were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> min
          and extracted with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TX100</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), stress
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were stained well with phalloidin, but
          microextensions were lost (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>). The SEM
          observation before and after preparation for fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (washing and incubation with probes) indicated
          that microextensions were lost during these steps of the
          procedure. On the other hand, microextensions of cells
          prefixed with glutaraldehyde or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP</ENAMEX> prior to extraction
          were very well preserved indeed (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Eand 3I</ENAMEX>).
          However, the cytoskeleton of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells
          could not be exposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> and some structures
          apparently were lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP</ENAMEX>-Tsb-fixed cells when analysed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Quick extraction with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTSB</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times), followed by
          fixation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde also preserved
          microextensions well indicating that fragmentation or
          removal of microextensions by extraction with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> does not occur within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> method
          provided excellent morphological preservation and
          immunolabeling with high fluorescence intensity of actin
          stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and microextensions (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Qand 3S</ENAMEX>).
          Although phalloidin staining and immunolabeling of
          tubulin were poor in cells prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX>
          method (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Rand 3T</ENAMEX>), this method provided the widest
          spectrum of reactivity with the probes investigated here
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and Table 1</ENAMEX>). The monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> reagent
          specific for Î²-actin worked only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX>-treated cells (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Oand 3S</ENAMEX>).
          Next, we compared the staining patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          well-characterized cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, vinculin and
          moesin, in cells prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> and other
          conventional fixation methods (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). As expected.
          vinculin localized at focal contacts in cells prepared by
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PFA/Triton X-100</ENAMEX> or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4M</ENAMEX>). Moesin staining, on the other hand, was
          primarily at the edge of cells and in microextensions,
          when cells were fixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4Gand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4K</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> was superior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> permeabilization procedure to
          preserve microextensions and for moesin staining (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4N</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>).
          TCA fixation was reported recently to be useful for
          staining of phosphorylated moesin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Therefore, we
          tested our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-phospho</ENAMEX>-moesin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> with this
          method and, as shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4H</TIMEX>, the fluorescence
          intensity was too low to distinguish characteristic
          structures probably because the amount of phosphorylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moesin</ENAMEX> is low in unstimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIH3T3 cells</ENAMEX> (cf. Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Figure 5demonstrates another example of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells
          stained with actin monoclonal and moesin polyclonal
          antibodies after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> fixation. Many branched
          microextensions were double-stained with these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, but occasionally, part of a microextension or
          an entire microextension apparently lacked actin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Evaluation of crosslinked polypeptides after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX> and extraction
          Our results suggested that some of procedures listed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> were inadequate for preserving fine structural
          details. Therefore, we re-evaluated the extent of
          crosslinking of polypeptides by gel electrophoresis and
          western blotting. The polypeptide banding patterns of
          extracts from unfixed and fixed cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> sample
          buffer are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incubation</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> detached cells from the dish (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 2</ENAMEX>), but addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM magnesium and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> prevented detachment to some extent (Figure
          6A, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Microtubule stabilizing buffer also
          prevented detachment (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). On the other
          hand, most polypeptides were retained on the dish after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> treatment (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Although most of
          Î²-actin was retained after <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> extraction,
          moesin was not unless <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde was added
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 7</TIMEX>). Under these conditions,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moesin</ENAMEX> and Î²-actin migrated predominantly as monomeric
          polypeptides at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 and 78</NUMEX> kDa positions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gels</ENAMEX> and only very small amounts of crosslinked moesin
          and Î²-actin were detected by western blotting at higher
          molecular weight positions (data not shown).
          Crosslinking of polypeptides was also evaluated after
          treatment with several other fixatives that preserved
          microextensions well and that were found to be useful
          previously for moesin staining (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6B</NUMEX>). Only a small
          amount of polypeptides was extracted when cells were
          fixed with glutaraldehyde or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP-Tsb</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>, lane <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 6</NUMEX>) and the cells were morphologically well
          preserved by these fixatives as observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX>,
          indicating that most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were irreversibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crosslinked</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, when cells were fixed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> or LP and treated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> saponin in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> for
          permeabilization, most of the polypeptides were either
          not crosslinked by these relatively mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fixatives</ENAMEX> or
          crosslinks were reversed by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> sample
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 5</TIMEX>). Similar results were
          obtained when cells were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7%</NUMEX> formalin or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX>, followed by permeabilization with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>.
          Threonine558-phosphomoesin was not dephosphorylated in
          these fixatives, as determined by western blotting with
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphomoesin antibodies</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6B</NUMEX>). We
          examined the effect of incubation time and temperature
          during fixation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>(+), since conditions
          for irreversible crosslinking of polypeptides in cultured
          cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> are unknown. As shown in Figure
          6C, fixation under the widely used conditions at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25Â°C</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX>, is not sufficient to
          irreversibly crosslink actin, moesin and many other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptides</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, the required time for incubation
          can be shortened, but most of the actin molecules were
          not irreversibly crosslinked even after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min.
          Incubation with sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">borohydride</ENAMEX> after fixation in PFA
          had no effect either (data not shown) suggesting that
          reversible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> may have formed that could not be
          reduced.
        
        
          Biochemical analysis of DOTMAC-insoluble materials
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells
          NIH3T3 cells suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          staurosporine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">¼M calyculin A</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> pervanadate and
          fractionated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> or DOTMAC. Similar to
          results in platelets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], the polypeptide patterns on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels differed for DOTMAC- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-extracted cells and more polypeptides were
          recovered in the DOTMAC- as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-insoluble fraction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Many signaling
          molecules are known to be sequestered into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-insoluble fraction during activation and/or
          aggregation of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platelets</ENAMEX>, and cytoskeletal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> has been inferred from this result. While
          this may be true for some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the postulated
          cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">threonine558</NUMEX>-phosphorylated
          moesin was maintained only when platelets were extracted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX>, but not with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. By
          contrast, phosphorylated moesin was found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insoluble</ENAMEX> material of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIH3T3 cells</ENAMEX> after extraction with
          both types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). When extracted with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>, a larger amount of insoluble
          phosphomoesin was detected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> as compared
          to DOTMAC. Different concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1% and 2%</NUMEX>) were tested and correlated with the amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moesin</ENAMEX> released from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells, but the insoluble
          fraction of moesin was always higher with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X</ENAMEX>-100
          than with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          We also analysed for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins
          in the insoluble fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pervanadate</ENAMEX> (PV), a potent inhibitor of tyrosine
          phosphatases, extracted with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>. A larger
          fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          recovered in the DOTMAC-insoluble pellet (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>)
        
        
          DOTMAC induces bundling of actin filaments and
          microtubules
          The excellent preservation of the cytoskeleton in
          microextensions of cells fixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA/DOTMAC</ENAMEX> could be
          due to stabilization of the cytoskeleton in general or of
          actin filaments selectively. We, therefore, explored
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> has a direct effect in vitro on actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX> prepared from purified actin. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, actin filaments bundled in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8B</NUMEX>) suggesting that this might contribute
          to the greater stability of the actin cytoskeleton that
          we have observed in cells extracted with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>.
          This effect is relatively specific since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> disrupted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubules</ENAMEX> and they appeared as amorphous filaments
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8D</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detection</ENAMEX> and definition of micropodia and
          ultramicroextensions
          Extensions of the cell surface were first described as
          fibrous projections of tissue culture cells by electron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Since then, the terminology has
          varied in the literature and extensions have been
          designated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pseudopodia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], microextensions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>],
          retraction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], microspikes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], filopodia [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 27, 28</TIMEX>], often without a clear definition of these
          terms. Microvilli are light microscopically distinct from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filopodia</ENAMEX> and retraction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filopodia</ENAMEX> or
          microspikes extend actively from the cell surface,
          whereas retraction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are extensions that have been
          left behind by a retracting lamellipodium or that are
          derived from an attached filopodium. We use the term
          "micropodia" here for morphologically describing
          filopodia, microspikes, and retraction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and to
          differentiate these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> from lamellipodia. While
          the transiently occurring filopodia and retraction fibers
          can largely be distinguished only by time-lapse video
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], both, micropodia and lamellipodia, are
          functionally related to movement of cells. Micropodia
          were reported to have diameters of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.2 Î</NUMEX>¼m [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] or
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.08â¼ 0.16 Î</NUMEX>¼m [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and lengths ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 to 30 Î</NUMEX>¼m [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>]. On the other hand, microvilli are more permanent
          discrete cylindrical projections <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.1 Î¼m</NUMEX> in diameter
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 2 Î¼m</NUMEX> in length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] that may serve different
          purposes, such as in brushborder membranes of the
          intestinal epithelium or in lymphocytes. Numerous slender
          extensions running in parallel were observed previously,
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat epithelial</ENAMEX> (parenchymal) cells adhere to each
          other [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> also occur in primary
          keratinocytes mediating intercellular adhesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
          However, these extensions appeared to be thicker
          (estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as 0.1Î¼m</NUMEX> in diameter, although their apparent
          diameter depended on conditions of coating with
          metals).
          Our experiments were focused on the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microextensions</ENAMEX> and their cytoskeletal core by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confocal</ENAMEX> laser scanning microscopy by searching for a new
          fixation protocol. Here, we clearly show that NIH3T3
          cells not only extend microextensions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1â¼ 0.2 Î¼m</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> and of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to â¼ 40 Î¼m</NUMEX> in length, but also slender
          structures of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.05 Î</NUMEX>¼m diameter. The latter were
          previously described in the tumor cell lines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-A31
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balb</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/3T3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A31</ENAMEX> transformed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">murine sarcoma</ENAMEX> virus,
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]), and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A875</TIMEX>, a malignant human lung melanoma line
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A31</NUMEX> cells, membranous strands with diameters
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼m extended away from and between cells
          over distances of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-15 Î¼m</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A875</NUMEX> cells, "filopodia"
          had diameters of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05 Î¼m</NUMEX> or less and were often branched.
          However, details of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were not given and
          not further discussed. In the literature, terms such as
          slender filopodia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>], or slender microvilli [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>] have been used. All filopodia and microvilli are
          morphologically slender and these descriptive terms in
          general have not been used to refer to microextensions
          having a particular dimension. In order to distinguish
          them from others and to avoid confusion, we propose the
          term ultramicroextensions for discrete cellular
          extensions that are less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05 Î¼m</NUMEX> in diameter.
          Ultramicroextensions extend like micropodia from the cell
          surface, from the tips of micropodia, from microvilli, or
          they branch out from micropodia or other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX>. We strongly believe that these are
          unique structures and not artificially created by our
          sample preparation technique. First, unless cells
          contacted each other, they were rarely seen even after
          incubation for prolonged periods, suggesting that they
          are not simply created by the collapse of parts of the
          cell. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, their shape is rather similar to the
          generally larger microspikes or microvilli. Future work
          might show that they can be detected by differential
          interference-contrast microscopy and electronic image
          processing or other techniques, which would greatly
          facilitate functional studies. Ultramicroextensions may
          be difficult to distinguish by immunofluorescence
          microscopy from micropodia that also appear as small
          fluorescent dots on the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, or they may remain
          undetected due to low fluorescence signal owing to their
          small size. The filopodia of spreading 3T3 cells were
          extensively studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albrecht-Buehler et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 27</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>], but ultramicroextensions were not described
          presumably because these studies were carried out during
          early spreading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells. Cells that do not touch
          other cells rarely display ultramicroextensions even
          after long periods of incubation. Ultramicroextensions
          were quite frequent between cells and on the surface of
          cells grown at confluency. This suggests that their
          formation is triggered by contact with other cells and
          that they are not primarily related to cell movement.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preservation</ENAMEX> and exposure of cytoskeleton in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microextensions</ENAMEX> and ultramicroextensions
          We have successfully exposed the cytoskeleton of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microextensions</ENAMEX> and ultramicroextensions using a newly
          developed fixative that contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX>. In order to
          study the structure of the cytoskeletal network it is
          necessary to extract cells with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> to expose
          cytoskeletal filaments for electron microscopic imaging.
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> were tested for their effects on
          cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schliwa et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], but the
          cationic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent DOTMAC</ENAMEX> was not included. In addition,
          past studies on the cytoskeleton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent-</ENAMEX>extracted
          cells have mainly focused on the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and subcortex
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 8</ENAMEX>], but not on microextensions. Although extraction
          can be done before, during, or after fixation, we used
          simultaneous extraction and fixation, because (i)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> molecules may be rearranged or altered
          during fixation, as irreversible crosslinking of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptides</ENAMEX> is not complete even after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> incubation
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) although actin was more
          difficult to extract, moesin and other polypeptides were
          removed already with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX>.
          Addition of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> was a necessary compromise to
          visualize the cytoskeleton and its associated molecules
          no matter which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> was being used.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> induced bundling of actin filaments
          and microtubules, which could have affected
          ultrastructural features of the cytoskeleton,
          microextensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX>-extracted cells did not
          differ from those of non-treated cells. On the contrary,
          bundling of actin filaments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> may have stabilized
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">actin-containing structures</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX>, micropodia,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX> and microvilli were well preserved,
          but their lipid membranes apparently were lost. This made
          it possible to trace the origin of micropodia and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultramicroextensions</ENAMEX>. While the cytoskeleton of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micropodia</ENAMEX> appeared to connect to the cytoskeleton
          located at the edge of the cells, by contrast, filaments
          of ultramicroextensions seemed to extend from or connect
          to cytoplasmic, rather than subcortical structures.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> is the most widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> to
          expose the cytoskeleton for biochemical and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistological</ENAMEX> studies, but without prefixation it
          caused a marked loss of cytoskeletal material [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>].
          This method also has been criticized for loss of the
          microtrabecular lattice [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 40</ENAMEX>]. This loss is sometimes
          advantageous to expose certain types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filaments</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>],
          but this was not relevant to our study. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> is
          not useful and even inappropriate for exposing and
          maintaining the cytoskeleton of microextensions. The
          fragmentation of microextensions and the amount of
          material lost with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> were time, temperature
          and concentration dependent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> tended to
          be unmasked at low temperatures and at low concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>, and the loss of material occurred
          especially in lamellipodia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. These earlier data are
          consistent with our results concerning lamellipodia, but
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microextensions</ENAMEX> were ignored. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          preferred to use <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>, a relatively high
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>, because it is critical for
          rapid solubilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX> and cessation
          of cell activity. However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> destroyed
          microextensions even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEM</ENAMEX> buffer. Another problems with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> is that most of the cells detached from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> and the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are usually quite
          distorted in shape [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. We have seen similar shape
          changes with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100-</ENAMEX>extracted cells after
          relatively short prefixation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The composition of the extraction buffer is an
          important factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTSB</ENAMEX>, which is
          essentially similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHEM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEM</ENAMEX>, or MTPB, was shown to
          give the best preservation of the cytoskeleton, no
          morphological differences were seen between these buffers
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>(+), when the cells were extracted with DOTMAC
          (data not shown). Addition of phalloidin, taxol, or PEG
          did not make a difference either (data not shown). In our
          experience, the divalent cations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>(+) prevented the
          cellular retraction seen within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          and are necessary to maintain interactions between
          DOTMAC-resistant components and the substrate (data not
          shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, caused rapid cessation
          of all cell activity.
          The type of fixative is another important determinant
          for the analysis of cell shape and structural integrity
          of the cytoskeleton. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutaraldehyde</ENAMEX> is considered the
          best fixative to preserve these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, but there are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> disadvantages. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prefixation</ENAMEX> and postfixation
          with glutaraldehyde precludes exposure of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> and, also quite frequently, the binding of
          antibody probes. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> is a
          rather weak crosslinker. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crosslink</ENAMEX> formed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is
          theoretically and experimentally a non-reducible
          methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> are readily hydrolysed
          during washing. The only irreversible reaction would be
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that takes place slowly with the aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>]. Our studies provide first systematic data that cells
          should be kept in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at room
          temperature or for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> to irreversibly
          crosslink most of the polypeptides (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Thus,
          enzymatic reactions or rearrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosol</ENAMEX> could occur for some time during fixation. In
          fact, dephosphorylation of moesin occurred in mouse
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTD-1 cells</ENAMEX> during fixation in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1% or 4%</NUMEX>
          paraformaldehyde at room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. As
          shown here, however, moesin apparently was not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PFA</ENAMEX>-based fixatives in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells.
          These conflicting results could be due to differences of
          cell type and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody reactivity</ENAMEX>. We have prepared
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde solution</ENAMEX> by dissolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
          because it was pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> included in
          commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> as a preservative, is enough to
          cause retraction of ruffles and lamellipodia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          However, no morphological difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> was apparent when cells were extracted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> method by fluorescent
          microscopy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amieva et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] pointed out that some
          microextensions may be lost during fixation and washing
          steps, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] added glutaraldehyde to
          the fixative in order to stain these delicate structures
          with phalloidin, but glutaraldehyde had to be omitted for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX>. Because the procedure developed here
          resulted in a comparable preservation of microextensions,
          we systematically analysed these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with various
          probes by immunofluorescence microscopy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX>
          method provided excellent morphological preservation of
          actin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and microextensions and high
          intensity immunolabeling of actin, while phalloidin
          staining was poor probably owing to partial denaturation
          of actin filaments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC/PFA</ENAMEX> method thus should be
          considered the method of choice for the preservation and
          immunostaining of microextensions or when cells fixed by
          other methods cannot be stained with certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisera</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Functional significance of fractionation of
          polypeptides into DOTMAC-resistant components in NIH3T3
          cells
          We have previously shown that purified
          threonine558-phosphomoesin selectively co-sedimented with
          actin filaments in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> or PIPs, but
          excess <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> disrupted the interaction of moesin
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">threonine558</NUMEX>-phosphomoesin was maintained
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX> were extracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX>, but not with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>. These results were consistent with a model
          of an allosteric change induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> (or DOTMAC) that
          exposed and maintained a cytoskeleton-binding site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moesin</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells, however, unlike in platelets,
          most of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">threonine558</NUMEX>-phosphomoesin was retained in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100-insoluble</ENAMEX>, but only â¼ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> in the
          DOTMAC-insoluble fraction. How can this difference be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconciled</ENAMEX>? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that moesin in NIH3T3
          cells is modified differently. For example, moesin is
          tyrosine phosphorylated in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">v-src-transfected</NUMEX> MDCK cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>]. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that
          threonine558-phosphomoesin interacts with non-extractable
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> besides actin filaments in cells
          other than platelets. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">moesin</ENAMEX> lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal F-</ENAMEX>actin binding domain
          remained strongly associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-insoluble
          material of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIH3T3 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. While this issue needs
          further work, it is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> extraction alone
          cannot be used as the sole criterion for cytoskeletal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as moesin as stated
          frequently in the recent literature.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>]. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> were used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> as
          listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde solutions</ENAMEX> may have
          been obtained from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, for our study a

          When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 lysis</NUMEX> buffer, most of the cells detached from the
          culture dish. This made it impossible to quantitatively
          analyze lipids in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-insoluble fraction of
          attached growing cells. Therefore, the cells were
          suspended using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> before lipid analysis and extracted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> extraction buffer as described above. The

          The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. The lipids were extracted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml of
          chloroform/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2:1, v/v</ENAMEX>) in an ultrasonic bath for

          When the cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOTMAC</ENAMEX> lysis buffer,
          they did not detach and, therefore, lipids could be
          extracted directly from the cells on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> culture dishes
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chloroform</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2:1, v/v</ENAMEX>) after
