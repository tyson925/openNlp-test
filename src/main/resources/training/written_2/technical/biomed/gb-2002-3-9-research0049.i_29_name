        High-resolution mapping and chromosome walking, critical
        steps in the positional cloning of a mutant gene, may
        become problematic and tedious without high-density
        molecular markers. Although a number of molecular-marker
        maps are available for various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, further resolution
        of the target region is often required, as markers may be
        irregularly spaced along the chromosome owing to uneven
        rates of recombination. In addition, focusing the genetic
        interval reduces the time and resources necessary for
        chromosome walking. Comparative mapping is based on regions
        of microsynteny between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and provides a
        powerful technique for enriching molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> in the
        region surrounding a gene of interest. A number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have suggested that map-based cloning in
        economically important <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crop species</ENAMEX> can be expedited by
        utilizing chromosomal microsynteny between the target and a
        model species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The recently completed sequence
        of the entire genome of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] now
        provides a catalog of ordered reference genes immediately
        applicable to other higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX>
        of synteny is well documented in closely related species
        within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>: for example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and 
        Brassica oleracea [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]; and tomato, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and capsicum [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        Recent comparative sequence analyses and mapping studies
        have indicated that microsynteny and macrosynteny are also
        well conserved between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and evolutionarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divergent species</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tomato</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>] or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybean</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. Thus, comparative mapping has the potential to rapidly
        identify additional molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> in a region of
        interest in those species.
        The single-gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diageotropica</ENAMEX> (dgt) mutant of tomato
        ( 
        Lycopersicon esculentum ) displays a
        pleiotropic phenotype that includes reduced auxin
        sensitivity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. A number of physiological and molecular
        studies suggest that a 
        Dgt -dependent auxin signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> regulates a subset of early
        auxin-response genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]; however, the nature
        of the 
        Dgt gene is still unknown. We have
        been using a map-based cloning strategy to isolate the 
        Dgt gene, previously mapped to the
        long arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. On the basis of recent
        comparative sequence analyses showing well-conserved
        microsynteny between the tomato and 
        Arabidopsis genomes within relatively
        small regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>], we applied microsynteny-based
        comparative mapping to facilitate the positional cloning of
        the 
        Dgt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and successfully reduced the
        genetic interval with new molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>.

          tomato genetic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> maps [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], initial studies mapped
          the 
          dgt locus to a region of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cM</ENAMEX> near the bottom of the long arm of tomato chromosome
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,308 backcross</NUMEX> (BC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> screened, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>
          were determined to be recombinant <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between markers</NUMEX> TG269
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT190</ENAMEX>, whereas no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were found to be recombinant
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between TG389</TIMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dgt</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To identify
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within that region by finding
          microsyntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in 
          Arabidopsis , nucleotide sequences
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> markers most closely linked to the 
          dgt locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TG269</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG389</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT190</ENAMEX>)
          were used to identify homeologous sequences in the 
          Arabidopsis genome database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> matches with an arbitrary threshold expect value (
          
          E -value) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.01</NUMEX> were
          investigated as significant matches.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> putative microsyntenic regions (MSRs) were
          identified in the 
          Arabidopsis genome (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1</TIMEX>, homeologs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> tomato RFLP markers were
          found in the same linear order on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent 
          Arabidopsis bacterial artificial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome</ENAMEX> (BAC) clones from chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ( 
          Arabidopsis accession numbers are
          in parentheses): F20M13 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AL035540</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T9A14</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AL035656</NUMEX>).
          The 
          Arabidopsis homeologs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG269</TIMEX>,
          TG389, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT190</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1</TIMEX> had corresponding 
          E -values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4e -3, 2e -7</ENAMEX>, and 3e
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, respectively. The 
          Arabidopsis homeologs of markers
          TG269 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT4g38850</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG389</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT4g38730</NUMEX>), and CT190
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT4g38580</NUMEX>) encode a small auxin-upregulated protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAUR</ENAMEX>), a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP</ENAMEX>)
          and a farnesylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (FP), respectively. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          microsyntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MSR2</NUMEX>) spanned two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis BAC</ENAMEX> clones, F11l11
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AL079347</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M4E13</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AL022023</NUMEX>), and was also located on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, but only yielded homeologs for tomato
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TG269</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CT190</TIMEX> ( 
          E -values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1e -3and 8e -3,</ENAMEX>
          respectively). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> microsyntenic region (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MSR3</NUMEX>) was
          located on 
          Arabidopsis chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and
          spanned 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis BACs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F26H11</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC006263</NUMEX>)
          and F7O24 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC007142</NUMEX>). This region only contained a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeolog</ENAMEX> to TG389 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AT2g21120,</ENAMEX> 
          E -value of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9e -4</ENAMEX>). However,
          additional auxin-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified in this
          region (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AT2g21200</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT2g21220</NUMEX>), which made continued
          analysis potentially beneficial. In addition, this region
          had previously been reported to be syntenic to MSR1 [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. Therefore, we also included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MSR3</NUMEX> in the comparative
          analysis of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX> between tomato and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> .
          Close inspection of the microsyntenic regions detected
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> analysis suggested that the genomic
          microstructure was highly conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1</TIMEX> also have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR2</TIMEX> and/or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MSR3</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The order of the
          microsyntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was highly conserved in the three
          regions with the colinear pattern of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> -
          phospholipase-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pEARLI 4</ENAMEX>), cyclophilin-type
          peptidyl-prolyl 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cis/trans isomerase</ENAMEX> (PPI), and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAUR</ENAMEX> and auxin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (COSAP) -
          serving as a common footprint for these MSRs. At the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, variation in syntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by gene duplication
          and/or translocation was also evident in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX>.
          For example, the sequences of PPI (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT4g38740</NUMEX>),
          phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C precursor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPLC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AT4g38690</TIMEX>), and disease-resistance response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRRP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AT4g38700</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MSR1</ENAMEX> are duplicated only in
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSR2</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR3</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPLCs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AT4g34920/AT4g34930</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRRPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AT2g21110/AT2g21120</ENAMEX>) remain tandemly duplicated in
          MSR2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSR3</ENAMEX>, respectively, whereas PPI (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AT4g34960</NUMEX>)
          appears to have been translocated after gene duplication
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR2</TIMEX>.
        
        
          High-resolution mapping of the dgtlocus by MEST
          markers
          Because 
          Arabidopsis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1</TIMEX> contained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeologs</ENAMEX> in common with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> markers in the 
          dgt region of tomato, we used it as
          our main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> region to search for corresponding tomato
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeologs</ENAMEX>. MSR1 contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> intervening genes between
          the homeologs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG269 and CT190</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> analysis of
          each intervening 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> against the Tomato
          Gene Index [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> hits that were
          chosen for further investigation on the basis of the
          original annotation of the 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and a low expect
          value (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< e -20</ENAMEX>). From those, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> robust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          were obtained and selected for development into new CAPS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. The original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> products provided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> new CAPS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based genotyping
          against the informative mapping population (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> previously identified informative recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, as well as an equal number of non-informative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, were used to analyze the new microsyntenic <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX>) markers. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAPS</ENAMEX> markers tested, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> MEST
          markers mapped in the 
          dgt region. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MESTs</ENAMEX>, BG643476
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">putative protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC85079</TIMEX> (EF-hand containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFP</ENAMEX>), identified a crossover
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between TG269 and TG389</TIMEX>/ 
          dgt , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX>, TC98260
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">glycine</NUMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRP</ENAMEX>), revealed a crossover between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TG389/</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dgt and CT190</TIMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new
          markers, which flank 
          dgt , narrowed the target region
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> cM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> cM in our small mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> markers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC89380</TIMEX> (PPI), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC92082</TIMEX> (PPLC), and
          AW624844 (DRRP), co-segregated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TG389</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dgt</ENAMEX> . Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> markers
          derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1</TIMEX> have paralogs in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX>, but
          BG643476 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AT4g34830</TIMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC85079</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AT4g38810</TIMEX>) are
          unique to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSR1 and MSR2</TIMEX>, respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          We screened a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TG389</ENAMEX> and obtained two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52M1 and 9302</TIMEX>. Each tomato BAC clone was
          estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 120</NUMEX> kb in length by
          pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (data not shown), but
          neither contained marker TG269 or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CT190 sequences</NUMEX> (data
          not shown) to allow confirmation that the 
          dgt locus was located on either BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>. When both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones were probed with the newly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identified MEST</ENAMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC98260</TIMEX> (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">intervening marker</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between TG389</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT190</ENAMEX>), was detected
          only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">52M1</ENAMEX>, whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BG643476 and TC85079</TIMEX> (the
          intervening markers between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG269 and TG389</TIMEX>), were
          present only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">93O2</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> MEST
          markers that co-segregated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG389</TIMEX> were detected on
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones. These results permitted partial ordering
          of the newly identified MEST markers and demonstrated
          that the 
          dgt locus was present within the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones.
          Subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">BAC</ENAMEX> end-sequencing and BLAST searches of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomato Gene</ENAMEX> Index identified BAC <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9302 and 52M1</TIMEX> insert
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ends nearest the telomere as containing genomic
          nucleotide sequence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously identified MESTs -
          TC92082 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TC98260</ENAMEX>, respectively. This information
          placed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TC92082</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between TC98260</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> markers that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-segregated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TG389</TIMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The BAC
          end-sequences nearest to the centromere for BACs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9302</TIMEX> and
          52M1 were identified as BG643476 (PP) and TC87127
          (chalcone synthase-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHSP</ENAMEX>), respectively.
          BG643476 was confirmed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> when the sequence was
          later posted to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tomato EST</TIMEX> database. The BAC
          end-location placed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BG643476</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between markers TG269</TIMEX> and
          TC85079. Taken together, these results strongly suggest
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that TC85079 and TC98260</TIMEX> are the closest flanking
          molecular markers to 
          dgt present in the two overlapping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TG389</ENAMEX>. BLAST searches of the BAC
          end-sequences against the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Information Resource</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX>) database further confirmed microsynteny between
          the 
          dgt region of tomato chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          As would be expected if microsynteny were maintained,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional markers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC87150</TIMEX> (amidophosphoribosyi
          transferase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APRT</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC47447</TIMEX> (basic leucine zipper
          transcription factor, bZIP), were determined to be
          non-informative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> markers with respect to our
          positional cloning strategy because they fell outside
          TG269. However, their sequences maintained microsyntenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> and co-segregated with tomato RFLP marker TG258
          (data not shown), which is proximal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TG269</NUMEX> on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Given no rearrangement of
          tomato chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and that microsynteny between tomato
          and 
          Arabidopsis genomes remains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>,
          the predicted order of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> and BAC end-generated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in tomato would be as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TC47447 â†’</ENAMEX> TC87150
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â†’ TG269 â†’ BG643476 â†’ TC85079 â†’ TC87127 â†’ TC89380 â†’</ENAMEX> TG389
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â†’</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AW624844 â†’ TC92082 â†’ TC98260 â†’ CT190</ENAMEX> (centromere to
          telomere, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The exact order of these markers and
          the position of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dgt</ENAMEX> will be determined by complete
          sequencing of tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">93O2</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52M1</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        With the sequencing of the entire 
        Arabidopsis genome, comparative
        mapping and homeology-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene cloning</ENAMEX> is now available
        in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> via microsyntenic alignment of molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> against the sequenced reference genome [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. Although exceptions to the blanket application of this
        approach have been noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], our study successfully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> microsynteny analysis between the tomato and 
        Arabidopsis genomes to facilitate
        positional cloning of the 
        Dgt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in tomato. Using three
        sequential tomato RFLP markers from our target region, we
        searched the 
        Arabidopsis genome database and found
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome that enabled us to
        construct a detailed molecular map of the target area.
        Comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX> from the 
        Arabidopsis genome shows that the
        content and order of the genes are well conserved within
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. MSR1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSR3</ENAMEX> exhibit reverse polarity
        compared to orientation of tomato RFLP markers, whereas the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomal</ENAMEX> segment MSR2 has the same polarity as tomato.
        Using information from the three 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis MSRs</ENAMEX>, we identified eight
        new molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> on tomato chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which
        narrowed the genetic distance to the 
        dgt locus from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> cM to less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> cM and provided the necessary data to confirm the
        location of the 
        dgt locus on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> overlapping BAC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, thus avoiding the need for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chromosomal</ENAMEX> walk.
        Our strategy for microsynteny-based comparative mapping
        was straightforward and simple. First, the BLASTN program
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> was used to identify microsyntenic regions in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> containing homeologs of
        tester markers (tomato RFLPs) in similar order within a
        relatively small physical interval (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2 cM</ENAMEX>). Several
        published reports supported our strategy of using simple
        computer-based comparisons between tester and reference
        nucleotide sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent comparative sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> clearly presented microsynteny of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">105 kb</NUMEX> BAC DNA
        insert [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> kb cosmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> insert [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] from
        tomato chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 7</NUMEX>, respectively, to their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">homeologous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Paterson</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] suggested that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of chromosomal segments of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cM</ENAMEX> remain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colinear</ENAMEX> in distantly related species. Direct nucleotide
        sequence comparisons (BLASTN) were used for each search as
        this provides a more stringent test of homology between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomato</ENAMEX> and 
        Arabidopsis sequences than do the
        conceptual translations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> (TBLASTX) that can
        be used for less stringent comparisons between
        evolutionarily divergent species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In our study,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> searches using default parameters enabled us to find
        a high level of microsynteny without encountering any major
        differences between the highest-scoring matches in either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> or BLASTN searches (data not shown). However, the 
        E -value for each BLAST hit was quite
        different between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX>, suggesting that an
        arbitrary threshold 
        E -value is critical to determine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of BLAST matches between evolutionarily distant
        nucleotide sequences and to place the homeologs on 
        Arabidopsis chromosomes.
        The occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple MSRs</ENAMEX> as a result of segmental
        duplications on the 
        Arabidopsis genome has been
        demonstrated by other comparative sequence analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEST</ENAMEX> markers identified in this study were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes conserved</ENAMEX> in multiple MSRs increases the probability
        of obtaining microsyntenic markers that are conserved
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene annotations</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome database, this
        simple computer-based analysis not only avoided the time
        and cost required for hybridization-based experimental
        methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>], but also allowed us to make informed
        decisions as to the location of unidentified genes of
        interest, as well as intervening genes between test markers
        in the target area.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> aspect of the comparative microsynteny
        approach was identification of tomato ESTs homeologous for
        the coding sequence of each 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the most closely
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer sets were designed from sequences
        of high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and robust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were obtained
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were then
        converted to co-dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">CAPS markers</ENAMEX> and used to genotype
        a small number of informative recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. The use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in comparative mapping has been successfully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to 
        Brassica <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. However, the success of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>-derived CAPS markers
        depends on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a well-established EST</TIMEX> database. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomato Gene</ENAMEX>
        Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Institute for Genomic Research</ENAMEX> (TIGR) is the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest sequence database for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and provided
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">131,988 EST</TIMEX> sequences at the time of this study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 28</TIMEX>].
        The tentative consensus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>) sequences of assembled ESTs
        can be used for integration of complex mapping data and
        identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX> between divergent
        species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Expressed gene sequences were used in this
        study as they can be converted to molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> more
        consistently than non-coding regions when comparing
        distantly related species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent
        comparative sequence analyses using monocots versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] and dicots versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] clearly showed that
        exon sizes are well conserved in homeologs even between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocots</ENAMEX> and dicots, whereas intron length varied in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">versus barley</ENAMEX> and tomato versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> . In BLAST searches using
        either the processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotide sequence</ENAMEX> or the predicted
        protein sequence of an 
        Arabidopsis gene, the score of each
        BLAST match was clearly higher and the 
        E -value was significantly lower when
        compared to the use of either non-processed nucleotide
        sequence or intergenic nucleotide sequence. Presumably, use
        of the predicted protein sequence of an 
        Arabidopsis gene increases the
        probability of identifying the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">microsyntenic EST</TIMEX> in
        comparative mapping of distantly related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        considering the average substitution rate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        -9/nucleotide site<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/year</TIMEX>, of nucleotides in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and
        the separation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">112 million years ago</TIMEX>, of tomato and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        The MEST-derived comparative map indicating that three
        regions of the 
        Arabidopsis genome are related to
        each other (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) supports the hypothesis that at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of duplication occurred in the 
        Arabidopsis genome followed by
        selective deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and/or minor rearrangements [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. Minor rearrangements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microsyntenic genes</ENAMEX> could
        potentially impede high-resolution mapping if placement of
        the syntenic markers within a relatively large segment
        indicated a missing sequence fragment, as reported for the
        comparative mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> and sorghum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Given that
        several genes exist between the homeologs of the two
        closest flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MESTs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC85079</TIMEX> (EFP) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TC98260</TIMEX> (GRP),
        and neither a deletion nor local rearrangement of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dgt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> has occurred in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSRs</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dgt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> could be one of the
        annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> between the homeologs of the two closest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flanking MESTs</ENAMEX>. It remains to be seen, however, whether
        additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomato genes</ENAMEX> are present in the region.
        Our results indicate that comparative microsynteny-based
        mapping can facilitate positional cloning of a target gene
        when information on genomic location is limited. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] recently utilized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">microsynteny</ENAMEX>-based comparative mapping to add new molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.067</NUMEX> cM region defined by a previously
        determined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb BAC clone containing the 
        ovate locus in tomato. Here,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">microsynteny</ENAMEX>-based comparative mapping was used to define
        the position of the 
        Dgt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> within a much larger region
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8 cM</NUMEX>) of the tomato genome by contributing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intervening MEST</ENAMEX> markers, initially derived from 
        Arabidopsis gene sequences, between
        TG269 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CT190</TIMEX>. The approach proved to be less technically
        complicated than other fingerprinting methods and points to
        several co-segregating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for further investigation as
        potential 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dgt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. We anticipate that
        this general approach will contribute significantly to the
        development of dense molecular marker maps for a variety of
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species to expedite map-based cloning.
