        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ribozymes</ENAMEX> whose activities are modulated by effector
        molecules have previously been engineered. For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herschlag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> have previously shown that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleobase</ENAMEX> could complement an abasic site within the
        hammerhead ribozyme, restoring cleavage activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lizardi</ENAMEX> engineered a hammerhead
        ribozyme that assumed an inactive secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>; upon
        the addition of an oligonucleotide that disrupted the
        engineered secondary structure, the ribozyme was activated
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . More recently, it has previously been shown that
        many selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nucleic acid binding species</ENAMEX> (aptamers)
        undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] In addition, when aptamers are conjoined to ribozymes,
        the ligand-induced conformational changes in the aptamers
        frequently modulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and hence the activities
        of the ribozymes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] For example, binding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theophylline</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-theophylline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aptamer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        modulates the conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] and the
        overall stability of the aptamer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] . Appending the
        anti-theophylline aptamer to the hammerhead ribozyme
        allowed cleavage activity to be modulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>-fold by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theophylline</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, appending the
        anti-theophylline aptamer to a small ribozyme ligase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>)
        generated an aptazyme that was activated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX>-fold by
        saturating theophylline concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The methods for engineering and selecting Group I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aptazymes</ENAMEX> appear to be generalizable to several different
        types of ribozymes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adjoining</ENAMEX> aptamers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>
        self-splicing intron would potentially allow the control of
        splicing not only 
        in vitro , but 
        in vivo . To this end, we have
        attempted to generate and assay Group I aptazymes.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Design of Group I aptazymes
          In order to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I self-splicing intron
          to a regulatable aptazyme, it was necessary to first
          identify sequences or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ribozyme</ENAMEX> whose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> might modulate splicing activity. The
          structural and kinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>
          self-splicing intron from the 
          thymidylate synthase ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">td</ENAMEX> ) gene in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bacteriophage T4</TIMEX> have
          been extensively studied. In particular, a series of
          nested deletions of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P6</NUMEX> stem-loop have been shown to
          partially or completely compromise ribozyme activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          ] . More importantly, either magnesium or the tyrosyl
          tRNA synthetase from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Neurospora mitochondria</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CYT18</NUMEX>) can
          suppress many of these defects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Previous
          studies with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> have also revealed that
          deletion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P5</NUMEX> stem-loop can modulate ribozyme
          activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . We hypothesized that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where
          deletions modulated ribozyme activity might also prove to
          be <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where aptamer conformational changes would
          modulate ribozyme activity. Based on these studies, we
          designed a series of Group I aptazymes in which the
          anti-theophylline aptamer was substituted for either a
          portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P6</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P5</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The anti-theophylline
          aptamer was attached at the same point as had previously
          proven successful in the design of theophylline-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavases</ENAMEX> and ligases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation</ENAMEX> in vitro
          The self-splicing activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I aptazymes
          were examined 
          in vitro using a standard splicing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnesium</ENAMEX> had previously been shown to
          suppress structural defects in the 
          td intron, and ligand-induced
          suppressions of splicing defects were examined by
          carrying out splicing reactions at either low (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM,
          stringent) or high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> mM, permissive) magnesium
          concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Several of the constructs were
          either relatively inactive (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th3P6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th5P6</TIMEX>, and
          Th6P6) or did not consistently show differential splicing
          activity (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th4P6 and Th2P5</TIMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
          constructs, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th3P6</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1P5</ENAMEX>, showed good
          activity (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of wild-type) and increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self-splicing</ENAMEX> in the presence of theophylline. For
          example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6</TIMEX> showed the greatest activation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5</TIMEX> showed low activation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-fold) at both magnesium concentrations.
          For all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">aptazymes</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th3P6</ENAMEX>, the
          ligand-induced splicing activity was greater in a
          standard assay at the more stringent (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 mM</NUMEX>) magnesium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The construct Th3P6 was inactive
          at lower magnesium concentrations, but underwent
          ligand-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splicing</ENAMEX> at the more permissive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 mM</NUMEX>). Interestingly, those aptazyme
          constructs that showed ligand-dependent activity closely
          resembled the original deletion variants that showed
          magnesium-dependent recovery of splicing activity. For
          example, the junction between the aptamer and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribozyme</ENAMEX> in the aptazyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2P6</ENAMEX> resembled the deletion
          variant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">td Î”P6-6</ENAMEX>; the aptazyme was
          activated by theophylline, while the splicing defect of
          the deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variant</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM magnesium was suppressed by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> mM magnesium or by stabilization of a tetraloop
          sequence that capped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the P6</TIMEX> helix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Defects that
          poise a ribozyme between active and inactive conformers
          have previously been used to engineer effector-dependence
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          The kinetics of splicing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most activated
          variants, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5 and Th2P6</TIMEX>, were examined in the presence
          and absence of theophylline (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As in the single
          point assays, the theophylline-dependence of the
          engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> was readily apparent (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). The
          time courses reveal that the extents of splicing of the
          aptazymes were significantly affected by the addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theophylline</ENAMEX> (Figures 2b,2c). The aptazyme modified at P5
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th1P5</NUMEX>) showed less theophylline-dependent enhancement of
          the extent of reaction than the aptazyme modified at P6
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th2P6</NUMEX>), consistent with the single point assays
          described above. Th1P5 was activated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-fold at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6</TIMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>-fold rate
          enhancement at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>). These levels of
          ligand-dependent activation were similar to those
          observed with the original hammerhead aptazyme
          constructs, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and it may prove possible to use 
          in vitro selection to further
          optimize activation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . However, when the time
          course data were fit with a single exponential equation,
          the rates of the initial reactions turned out to be very
          similar in both the presence and absence of theophylline
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Based on these results, the primary mechanism of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> is likely the same as has been observed for
          other aptazymes: ligand-induced conformational changes
          that stabilize functional ribozyme sequences and
          structures. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I self-splicing intron is
          a much more complicated ribozyme than either the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hammerhead</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> ligase; for example, the tertiary
          structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I intron is established by a
          complicated folding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ]
          Therefore, it was possible that theophylline-binding
          influenced the overall folding pathway of the engineered
          Group I aptazyme. In order to assess this possibility we
          examined the theophylline-dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2P6</ENAMEX> splicing
          reactions 
          in vitro following prolonged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>) to allow for re-folding. No
          significant change in the extent of ligand-dependent
          activation was observed following pre-incubation (data
          not shown). These results argue that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> and
          theophylline may need to be present to influence the
          folding pathway of the engineered Group I aptazymes.
          These results are also consistent with previous physical
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and kinetic [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] data that shows that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folding of the Group</ENAMEX> I intron is dependent in part upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Gene regulation in vivo
          Each of the successful aptazyme constructs was
          subsequently cloned into an interrupted 
          thymidylate synthase gene in place
          of the parental 
          td self-splicing intron. The
          vectors were introduced into an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> strain (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C600ThyA</TIMEX>::<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kan R</ENAMEX>)
          that lacked a functional 
          thymidylate synthase gene and that
          was a thymidine auxotroph. When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grown in rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> were subsequently plated on minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> lacking
          thymidine, no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> growth was observed with the
          exception of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5</TIMEX>. However, when theophylline (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5 mM</NUMEX>)
          was included in the minimal media, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> containing
          the intron <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2P6</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> containing
          the intron <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5</TIMEX> showed increased growth (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). All
          introns that originally showed no or low splicing 
          in vitro (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th3P6</ENAMEX>) could
          not rescue bacteria either in the presence or absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theophylline</ENAMEX>. Finally, no growth was observed in a
          negative control that contained a non-functional Group I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B11</NUMEX>), and no theophylline-dependent changes in
          growth were observed in a negative control in which
          mutations were introduced into the aptazyme to abolish
          theophylline binding (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6</TIMEX>.D). Interestingly, no growth
          was observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> harboring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the intron Th1P6</TIMEX>,
          despite the fact that this aptazyme showed the greatest
          activation by theophylline 
          in vitro . The plating results were
          consistent and reproducible over a variety of
          experiments.
          To better characterize the influence of the effector
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intron-splicing</ENAMEX>, we also carried out a series of
          growth experiments in liquid culture (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). An
          overnight bacterial culture that contained the 
          td gene divided by the aptazyme
          Th2P6 was inoculated into fresh, minimal media, effector
          was added, and growth was continuously monitored. As
          expected based on growth assays on solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, little
          growth was observed in the absence of theophylline.
          However, when theophylline (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 mM</NUMEX>) was added to liquid
          medium, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grew almost as well as a control in
          which the parental intron was inserted into the 
          td gene. Most importantly,
          bacterial growth was not activated by the
          structurally-related effector caffeine (i.e.,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7-methyltheophylline</TIMEX>); the anti-theophylline aptamer is
          known to discriminate between caffeine and theophylline
          by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . No effector-dependent
          growth differences were observed with cultures containing
          
          td genes divided by the
          non-functional Group I intron <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B11</TIMEX>. Similar results were
          obtained with cultures that contained the 
          td gene divided by the aptazyme
          Th1P5 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). However, in this instance there was
          some background growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uninduced bacteria</ENAMEX>, consistent
          with the higher level of background splicing activity 
          in vitro . If theophylline is
          regulating intron splicing 
          in vivo , then the extent of
          bacterial growth should be dependent upon the
          concentration of theophylline introduced into the media
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). However, theophylline was toxic to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          and caused a decrease in the growth of bacteria
          containing the parental 
          td intron at concentrations greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM. Consistent with this observation, low
          concentrations of theophylline progressively increased
          bacterial growth (by activating the 
          td intron) while concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theophylline</ENAMEX> above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 mM</NUMEX> progressively decreased bacterial
          growth (although levels of growth were still well above
          background).
          These results were all consistent with the hypothesis
          that theophylline regulates intron splicing 
          in vivo . To further probe whether
          this was in fact the case mRNA was isolated from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> treated with theophylline
          or not, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was used to confirm the presence of
          spliced introns (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). For each of the introns known
          to be responsive to theophylline 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6 and Th1P5</TIMEX>) an
          increase in spliced mRNA was observed, while most other
          introns that were not responsive to theophylline 
          in vivo did not show an increase in
          the levels of spliced mRNA. An exception to this was
          Th1P6, which originally showed theophylline-dependent
          splicing 
          in vitro and also showed
          theophylline-dependent splicing 
          in vivo . However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P6</TIMEX> did not
          mediate theophylline-dependent growth. The bacterial
          mRNAs were extracted, cloned, and sequenced, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
          them appeared to use a cryptic splice site.
          Several discrepancies were noted between intron
          activation 
          in vitro and effector-dependent
          growth. This is not surprising; other studies have
          revealed that there is often little correlation between
          ribozyme activity 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . However, since it
          is known that relatively small changes in gene expression
          can greatly affect the metabolism of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, another
          possible explanation for the apparent discrepancies is
          that relatively small modulations in intron splicing are
          amplified via cellular metabolism to yield growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. This would seem especially true in the
          current set of experiments, since the modulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thymidylate Synthase</ENAMEX> expression is known to greatly
          affect thymidine levels and cell growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . For
          example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> that are starved for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymine</ENAMEX> quickly die, a phenomenon known as 'thymineless
          death' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In this respect, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I aptazymes that
          may have yielded lower amounts of functional Thymidylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synthase</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th3P6</TIMEX>, which was less active than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2P6</TIMEX>;
          or Th1P6, which mis-spliced) did not allow bacterial
          growth. In contrast, aptazymes that may have yielded even
          modestly greater amounts of functional Thymidylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synthase</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5</TIMEX>, which was both highly active and
          modestly activated 
          in vitro ) allowed bacterial
          growth.
        
        
          Effector specificity
          In order to examine effector-specificity 
          in vivo , a new series of Group I
          aptazymes was constructed in which the anti-theophylline
          aptamer was mutated to bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylxanthine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3MeX2P6</NUMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> proved to be responsive to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-methylxanthine</TIMEX> both 
          in vitro and 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). However, the
          variants were no longer responsive to theophylline, nor
          were they responsive to a variety of other analogues,
          including caffeine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-methylxanthine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-methylxanthine,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3</NUMEX>-dimethyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urilic acid</ENAMEX>, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theobromine</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). In contrast, the original
          aptamer was known to also bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylxanthine, and the
          original Group I aptazyme (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th2P6</NUMEX>) also proved to be
          responsive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylxanthine 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c</NUMEX>). Thus, the
          responsivity of the aptazymes 
          in vivo appears to mirror their
          effector specificity 
          in vitro .
        
        
          Applications
          The ability to engineer Group I introns to be
          responsive to effector molecules has numerous potential
          applications. For example, it may prove possible to
          develop new gene therapies in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rely upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that can differentially activate gene expression,
          rather than having to rely upon a set level of endogenous
          expression of an introduced gene. Similarly, it may prove
          possible to use effector-dependent splicing to more
          finely monitor gene expression 
          in vivo . A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> could be localized
          to particular organs, cells, or organelles, and splicing
          of the aptazyme could be monitored via a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
          such as luciferase. It is also possible to imagine that
          engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes may
          find application in high-throughput, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-based screening
          assays that monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uptake</ENAMEX> or efficacy. These
          strategies should prove useful not only for self-splicing
          introns activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, but for introns activated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or peptides. In this regard, it is notable that
          some natural Group I introns have proven to be highly
          dependent upon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein cofactors</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>
          introns have been engineered whose tertiary structure and
          activity is dependent upon a peptide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Such
          applications could also be melded with other innovations
          dependent upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I self-splicing intron, such as
          the introduction of a trans-splicing intron that can
          potentially repair or modulate the expression of a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ]
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Group I aptazymes that were dependent upon theophylline
        both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo were engineered by conjoining
        the 
        thymidylate synthase ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">td</ENAMEX> ) intron with an anti-theophylline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aptamer</ENAMEX>. Although the 
        in vitro activation of splicing was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modest</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to an 18</NUMEX>-fold change in initial rate), this
        change was more than enough to mediate the survival of a
        thymidine-dependent 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> strain. The ligand
        specificity of the anti-theophylline aptamer carried over
        to the theophylline-dependent aptazyme, and no activation
        was seen with caffeine, which differed by a single methyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> from theophylline. The effector specificity could be
        rationally changed by changing the specificity of the
        conjoined aptamer: when a mutation was introduced into the
        anti-theophylline aptamer that led to discrimination
        against theophylline and in favor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylxanthine (that
        also differed from theophylline by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>),
        the aptamer became solely responsive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylxanthine 
        in vivo . Group I aptazymes may have
        a number of important biotechnology applications, including
        use as 
        in vivo , real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and as
        regulatable gene therapeutics.

          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> (GIBCO BRL, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">295</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>) was
          added and the reaction was incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for an
          additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was purified using
          Centri-Sep columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Separations, Adelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>)
          and quantitated.
        
        
          In vitrosplicing assays
          The assays were performed by heating the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 nM</NUMEX>)
          in H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> then
          transferring to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX>. Splicing buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM
          Tris-HCl, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), effector (theophylline, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 mM</NUMEX>)
          was added and the reactions were incubated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for an
          additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>. At this time a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5 Î¼l</NUMEX> aliquot was
          removed for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point and quenched with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼l stop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dye</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> formamide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> xylene cyanol, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> bromophenol blue). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>) was added to the
          remaining reaction (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼l total volume) to start the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> reaction. The reaction was incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> and then terminated with stop dye (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼l</ENAMEX>). The
          reactions were heated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼l was
          analyzed on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel
          was dried, exposed to a phosphor screen and analyzed
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>,
          CA).
          The reaction volumes were increased for the rate
          determination assay. Aliquots were taken at intervals
          between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 minutes and 15 minutes</TIMEX> and terminated with stop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dye</ENAMEX>. The reactions were analyzed as described above. For
          each time point, the number of counts in unreacted
          intron, spliced intron, and circularized intron were
          determined. Background counts were subtracted from these
          values. The fraction of reacted intron was then
          calculated as:
          
            
              (circular intron + spliced intron)
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/</ENAMEX> (unreacted intron + circular intron + spliced
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX>) 
             
          
          The individual time points were averaged together, the
          fraction reacted was plotted versus time, and rate
          constants were extracted by fitting the data to a
          single-exponential equation:
          
            
            F = 
            A * 
            e (- 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kt</ENAMEX> ) 
          
          The plotted data and rate constants for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1P5</TIMEX> and
          Th2P6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> are shown in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2band 2cand Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The changes in the extent of reaction observed between
          individual experiments, and thus the attendant error
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bars</ENAMEX>, were consistent with those observed during the
          kinetic analyses of other ribozymes. For example, studies
          of the hairpin ribozyme have shown that data points can
          vary between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> experiments by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50%</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . Our data points typically varied from one another
          by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          In vivoplate assay
          The plasmids containing the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I constructs
          were transformed into competent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C600ThyA</TIMEX>::<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kan Rcells</ENAMEX> and
          grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> with kanamycin <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. A small aliquot (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼l</ENAMEX>) of overnight cell culture was mixed with effector
          (theophylline, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5 mM</NUMEX>) or H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, spotted on plates, and grown
          overnight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. As a positive control, all constructs
          were also plated on minimal media plates with thymine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMT</ENAMEX>) and assayed for viability.
        
        
          In vivogrowth curves
          Cells grown overnight in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> were diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX> in MM
          containing either theophylline, caffeine,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-methylxanthine</TIMEX> or no effector, and analyzed on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microbiology Workstation Bioscreen C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labsystems, Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          RT-PCR analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from an overnight culture using a
          MasterPure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA purification</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicentre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>)
          and amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primers KM37</ENAMEX> and GM24
          following the protocol provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tth</ENAMEX> polymerase. The
          products were separated and analyzed on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> agarose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX>.
