        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> is a condition that promotes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> and increases the risk of cardiovascular
        events [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control and Prevention</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 47 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, have this condition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Contributors to the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">metabolic</ENAMEX> syndrome
        may include genetics, a sedentary lifestyle, a Western diet
        (high in refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbohydrates</ENAMEX>, low in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>, and high in
        saturated fat), cigarette smoking, and progressive weight
        gain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">metabolic</ENAMEX> syndrome
        include atherogenic dyslipidemia, a prothrombotic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
        insulin resistance, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and abdominal obesity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] . Each abnormality promotes atherosclerosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independently</ENAMEX>, but when clustered together, these metabolic
        disorders are increasingly atherogenic and enhance the risk
        of cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies there is evidence to support that
        several factors related to lifestyle habits may influence
        cardiovascular risk [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Among these factors the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect of several dietary patterns on human
        health, have already been underlined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
        these diets, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet, has received much
        attention during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decades</TIMEX>. It is reach in
        non-refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and it has a
        high monounsaturated: saturated fat ratio. Although the
        benefits from the adoption of this diet on all cause
        survival have long been recognized, little is known about
        its association with the development of acute coronary
        events, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>. In this
        work, we evaluated the effect of the adoption of
        Mediterranean diet on the risk of developing non-fatal
        acute coronary events, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Study's population
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CARDIO2000</ENAMEX> is a multicentre case-control study
          that investigates the association between several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demographic</ENAMEX>, nutritional, lifestyle and medical risk
          factors with the risk of developing non-fatal acute
          coronary syndromes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From January 2000 to August 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">848</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who had just entered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> event of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> (stable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> was
          excluded from the analysis) agreed to participate into
          the study (response rate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six hundred</NUMEX> fifty-eight
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) of them were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59.0</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years old</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65.3 ± 9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>). The inclusion
          criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">• First</ENAMEX> event of acute myocardial infarction diagnosed
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> of the following features: typical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrocardiographic</ENAMEX> changes, compatible clinical
          symptoms, specific diagnostic enzyme elevations, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">• First</ENAMEX> diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unstable angina</ENAMEX> corresponding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class III</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braunwald</ENAMEX> classification.
          Moreover, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1078</TIMEX> randomly selected cardiovascular
          disease free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (controls), frequency matched to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age (± 3 years</TIMEX>), sex, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> agreed
          to participate (response rate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight hundred and</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirty</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) of them were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58.0</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years old</TIMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">64.8 ± 9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>). Controls
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who visited the outpatients departments
          of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and at the same period with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coronary patients</ENAMEX> for minor surgical operations. All the
          controls were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without any clinical symptoms,
          signs or any suspicion of cardiovascular disease in their
          medical history, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> evaluated it. We used
          this type of controls in order to have more accurate
          medical information, to eliminate the potential adverse
          effect of several, unknown, confounders and to increase
          the likelihood that cases and controls share the same
          study base [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was
          decided through power analysis, in order to evaluate
          differences in the coronary relative risk greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>
          (statistical power > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX>, significant level <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Stratification
          According to the population distribution provided by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Statistical</ENAMEX> Services (census <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), we
          stratified our sampling into all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> regions, in
          order to include various socio-economical levels and
          cultural particularities of the investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          The enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are from, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>, the one
          half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> or private, of the two
          biggest metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thessalonica</ENAMEX>),
          and from, almost, all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> of the other
          regions (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterea Ellada</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thessalia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from
          Hpeiros, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thrace</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> from
          Peloponnese, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionian</ENAMEX> islands).
        
        
          Randomised procedure
          In order to reduce the unbalanced distribution of
          several measured or unmeasured confounders, both patients
          and controls were randomly selected. Thus, a sequence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> numbers (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1...0</NUMEX>) was applied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>'
          admission listings. The coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who assigned to
          the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were entered into the study and interviewed
          (i.e. approximately the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          that visited each cardiology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>). The same procedure
          was applied for the controls, after taking into account
          the matching criteria.
        
        
          Investigated parameters
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> retrieved the information regarding the
          investigated medical factors from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, and the information regarding the life style
          characteristics through a confidential questionnaire
          during a specific interview after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndday of the
          hospitalisation, for the cases and at entry for the
          controls. The evaluation of the nutritional habits was
          based on a nutrient questionnaire according to the
          guidelines from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Nutrition</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National School of Public Health</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> dietary pattern consists of: (a) daily
          consumption: of non refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> (whole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX>, brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, etc), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 - 3</ENAMEX>
          servings/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 servings/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>), olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> (as the
          main added lipid) and dairy products (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - 2</ENAMEX>
          servings/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), (b) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> consumption: of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-5</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">servings/week</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 - 4 servings/week</ENAMEX>), olives,
          pulses, and nuts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 servings/week</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sweets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 - 4 servings/week</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> consumption: of
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat products</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 - 5 servings/month</ENAMEX>). It is,
          also, characterized by moderate consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wineglasses</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) and high monounsaturated: saturated
          fat ratio (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>). This dietary pyramid was suggested by
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with substantial input from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Thus, we measured the consumption of
          these food items as an average per week, during the past
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Then, the frequency of consumption was quantified
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> in terms of the number of times a month the
          food was consumed. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> consumption multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          and a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was assigned to food items rarely or
          never consumed. In order to describe total diet we used
          composite scores, which are necessary for the evaluation
          of epidemiological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . We defined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who are "closer" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> type of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diet</ENAMEX> using as cut-off points the median values of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> consumption score as done by several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in the past [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Finally, alcohol
          consumption was measured by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol intake</ENAMEX>, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wineglasses</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> ethanol concentration).
          According to the collected medical information, the
          majority of the controls (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>)
          had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>-laboratory measurement during the past
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. In addition, we measured, both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          controls, arterial blood pressure levels (average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          measurements with subject sited and calm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>; using a standard sphygmomanometer. Fast total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> as well as fast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels were
          measured in serum. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the
          measurements were collected during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 12 hours</TIMEX> of
          hospitalisation, and for the controls at the end of the
          interview. The previous information as well as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' and controls' reports assisted us to
          characterize the subjects as hypertensive,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercholesterolemic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX>. In particular, in
          keeping with the long-standing classification criteria
          used in several epidemiological studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , patients
          who reported never having been told of having
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and were not currently taking any
          antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and whose blood pressure was
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/ 90</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mmHg</ENAMEX> were classified as normotensives.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> whose mean blood pressure levels were greater or
          equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">140 / 90</ENAMEX> mmHg or were under antihypertensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> were classified as hypertensives.
          Hypercholesterolemia was defined, as cholesterol levels
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl or greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl when two
          other risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> or use of
          special hypo-lipidemic treatment was present. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Diabetics</ENAMEX>
          were those with fast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl
          or were under special diet or treatment. Finally, we
          measured the height and the weight both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          controls. In addition, we marked any significant changes
          in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past years</TIMEX>. Thus,
          obesity was defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (weight / {height}
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kg/m 2</ENAMEX>. Current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were defined
          those who smoked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> cigarette per day.
          Quantification of smoking status was based on the
          calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX>-years adjusted for nicotine
          containment equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>-mgr per cigarette. Former
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who stopped smoking
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 1 year</TIMEX>. Physical activity was defined as any
          type of leisure time exercise or occupational activity,
          at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/week</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, and was gradated in
          qualitative terms such as light (expended calories < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kcal/ min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking slowly, cycling stationary, light
          stretching etc.), moderate (expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calories 4-7 Kcal/</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking briskly, cycling outdoor, swimming
          moderate effort etc.) and vigorous (expanded calories
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>7 Kcal/ min</ENAMEX>, i.e. walking briskly uphill, long
          distance running, cycling fast or racing, swimming fast
          crawl etc.) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          defined as physically inactive. Also, the intension and
          the duration of physical exercise were taken into
          account. Subject's educational level was measured and
          classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>, up to high school
          (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of schooling); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX>, high school,
          technical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> - 14 years of eschooling) but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university and Group III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>. Mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income,
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 5 years</TIMEX> was, also, recorded. Further
          details regarding the design and methodology of the
          CARDIO2000 study have been previously presented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ]
          .
          As previously mentioned in this work we focused our
          interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>. According
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP III</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
          was established if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more of the following risk
          factors were present:
          • waist circumference <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>102 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX> in) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> or

          Statistical analysis
          Continuous variables are presented as mean ± one
          standard deviation while qualitative variables are
          presented as absolute and relative frequencies. In order
          to fit multivariate risk models an exploratory analysis
          was initially applied. Contingency tables with
          calculation of chi-squared test, as well as the
          calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-test were applied for the
          evaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between the categorical
          and continuous variables with the outcome. Estimations of
          the relative risks of developing acute coronary
          syndromes, under several hypotheses, were performed by
          the calculation of the odds ratio (OR) and the
          corresponding confidence intervals through multiple
          logistic regression analysis, with stepwise elimination
          procedure. All reported P-values are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided
          tests and compared to a significant level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATA</ENAMEX> 6
          software was used for the calculations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATA Corp.</ENAMEX>

          Descriptive analysis
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three hundred and seven</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.2%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and

          III criteria. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> was more frequent in

          were found regarding the prevalence of the metabolic

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.420</NUMEX>). About the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of the controls and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> reported
          sedentary life (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.240</NUMEX>). Current smoking habits were
          highly associated with the prevalence of the metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, on both, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
          A consistent inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was observed between the
          prevalence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> and the financial
          status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> for trend = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.598</NUMEX>) and controls (p
          for trend = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>). No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were observed
          regarding the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> and the
          educational profile of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.280</NUMEX>) and the
          controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.136</NUMEX>). Focusing our interest on the
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet we observed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) of the controls (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) that fulfilled the criteria for the metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> were "closer" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet. Table

          hypercholesterolemia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, physical
          inactivity, obesity and smoking habits, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          controls that adopted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls that they did not adopt this diet.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> raise the confounding effect of the
          adoption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet on obesity, physical
          activity and smoking habits. Moreover, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          controls that were defined "closer" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> had lower prevalence of the conventional
          cardiovascular risk factors compared to the rest of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Risk stratification
          Multivariate analysis revealed that the metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> 2fold the coronary risk (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.35</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.87</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.84</NUMEX>) after adjustment for age, sex, physical
          activity levels, smoking habits, financial status and
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, hypercholesterolemia, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>. However, the unadjusted odds ratio for
          developing an acute coronary event in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who adopted
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.64</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.44</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>),
          indicating a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> reduction of the coronary risk as
          compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that did not adopt this diet. After
          taking into account the effect of the aforementioned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (descriptive analysis) as well as the effect
          of several potential confounders, like age and sex of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, systolic and diastolic blood pressures,
          total serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels, as well
          as premature family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX>, we
          found that effect of the consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
          diet on the coronary risk remains beneficial. In
          particular, the adoption of this diet is associated with
          a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) reduction of the
          coronary risk in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>.
          The calculated attributable risk by the formula:
          attributable risk = (odds ratio - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) / odds ratio [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          , suggested that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) of the acute
          coronary events could be prevented by the adoption of the
          Mediterranean diet, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with the metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who reported that they exercise at least once per
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">> 4 kcal/min</ENAMEX>) seems to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> benefit,
          since it is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.53</NUMEX>, P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) lower risk of developing acute coronary
          events, after adjusting for age, sex, and the levels of
          the common cardiovascular risk factors. This reduction of
          the coronary risk is much higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet
          or exercise (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) achieve
          alone in this group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this work we evaluated the effect of the adoption of
        Mediterranean diet on the development of acute coronary
        syndromes, in subject with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>. The data
        analysis revealed that the adoption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> is associated with a considerable reduction of the
        coronary risk, in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, after adjustment for
        several potential confounders.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> is a condition well established
        in nowadays, and it is associated with the promotion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> and increase of the cardiovascular risk.
        Moreover, there is extensive scientific evidence,
        especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with better and long lasting
        national health programs, that the prevalence of metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> has increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>, which suggest
        that the disease burden (including type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>) has
        increased as well [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Despite its multiple origins,
        obesity, sedentary life coupled with unhealthy diet and
        genetic factors interact to produce this syndrome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP III</ENAMEX>
        raised the significance of diagnosing and treating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>, focusing on physical activity, lowering
        excess body fat and on specific dietary patterns. During
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past years</TIMEX> several epidemiological studies have
        underlined the relation between diet and incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Dietary factors exert their influence largely through their
        effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lipids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX>, as well as on the
        other established modifiable risk factors, with the
        exception of cigarette smoking. Our findings support the
        hypothesis that adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet by subjects
        who met the criteria for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a significant reduction of the risk of
        developing acute coronary events. The investigated type of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> is low in saturated fat, high in monounsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>,
        mainly from olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, high in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> carbohydrates, from
        legumes, and high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibre</ENAMEX>, mostly from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>. Also, epidemiological studies suggest that the
        Mediterranean diet is associated with lower coronary heart
        disease risk, especially through the reduction of blood
        pressures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, and levels of several
        thrombogenic factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Recently, the
        findings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet Heart</ENAMEX> study illustrate the
        potential importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> dietary pattern,
        especially when compared to other recommended diets, like
        Step-I diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Also, results from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Study
        suggest that the monounsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids diets</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a significant reduction and a better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . However it still remains a matter of debate if the
        protective influence is primarily caused by single
        nutrients, e.g. dietary fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, potassium or dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibre</ENAMEX> or if it can be attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet
        as a whole [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUROASPIRE Study</ENAMEX> group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> suggest to the
        cardiologists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and public health policy makers
        to moderate the prevalence of the cardiovascular risk
        factors in order to further reduce coronary heart disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality and improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s chances of
        survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . This reduction may be achieved through
        the adoption of a healthier lifestyle, including stopping
        smoking, initiation of physical activities and adoption of
        a healthy diet. Recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCEP ATP III</ENAMEX> recommended for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        in order to reduce the prevalence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">metabolic</ENAMEX> syndrome
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. These changes underlined the importance
        of low-saturated diet consumption (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of total fat) and
        physical exercise. In our work we found that the adoption
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet seems to be associated with a
        considerable reduction of acute coronary events (i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>)
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, is
        that the adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet by physically
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is associated with much higher reduction of
        the odds of developing acute coronary event, than diet or
        exercise achieve alone. A plausible explanation could be
        the low concentration of this type of diet in saturated fat
        and the non-lipid-lowering benefits that physical
        activities and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> diet have been reported to
        produce (including antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory
        effects) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . In accordance to that, several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have reported that non-pharmacological
        lifestyle interventions, like diet and exercise, could be
        useful in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ]
        .
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study concerning the prevalence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and the effect of the
        Mediterranean diet on the related coronary risk. The
        results of our study suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> of the acute
        coronary events could be prevented by the adoption of the
        Mediterranean diet in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> and training will be critical to ensure that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> have knowledge to diagnose and treat patients
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>. So the early identification,
        treatment (with non pharmacological interventions) and
        prevention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> seems to be extremely
        challenging and provoking for the health policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, in
        order to reduce the epidemic of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>, improper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> and sedentary lifestyle. However, even the
        observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is independent from several potential
        confounders it is hard to claim that our findings suggest
        causal evidence and much remains to be learned about this
        "ecological" effect on coronary risk in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Limitations of the study
        In retrospective case-control studies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main sources
        of systematic errors may exist, the selection and the
        recall bias. In order to eliminate selection bias we tried
        to set objective criteria, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls.
        However, insignificant misclassification may exist, since a
        small percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asymptomatic coronary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wrongly assigned to</ENAMEX> controls, even if they were evaluated
        by a cardiologist. Also, in case-control studies, it is
        usually observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had a recent adverse
        event are more likely to place greater emphasis
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">overestimate</NUMEX>) on several factors related to the disease
        than the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (recall bias). In order to reduce
        this type of bias and analyze accurate information we made
        an effort to obtain accurate information from the patients
        as well as from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> or their accompanying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. However, overestimation of the effect of the
        investigated combination may still exist. Concerning the
        medical information, we tried to avoid recall bias by
        obtaining accurate and detailed data from subjects medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. However, over/under estimation may still exist,
        especially in the measurement of nutritional and smoking
        habits, and the onset of the investigated cardiovascular
        risk factors. Moreover, the coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died at
        entry or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after were not included in the study. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> could influence our results, but, since the proportion
        of deaths during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> was estimated between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>, we believe that the inability to include the fatal
        events did not alter significantly our findings.
        Furthermore, regarding the potential effect of uncontrolled
        - unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounders</ENAMEX>, we tried to reduce it using the same
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls.
