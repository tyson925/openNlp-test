        Poisonings are among the most frequent indications for
        hospitalization in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . However, the
        frequency of hospitalizations for poisonings (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> overdose
        or toxicity) in renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infrequently</ENAMEX> reported, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] in contrast to its
        occurrence in kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Because many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> used by transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> can be toxic, it
        might be expected that renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> would
        have a higher risk of poisonings than the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, especially in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> post-transplant year
        when dosages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunosuppressive medications</ENAMEX> are usually
        at their highest. Analysis of the incidence and causes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poisonings</ENAMEX> represents an opportunity to explore the
        frequency and risk factors for medical errors, since many
        such complications may be avoidable. The impact of
        hospitalized poisonings on subsequent survival after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX> has also not been assessed. Therefore, we
        analyzed national diata from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> report. Our
        objectives were to determine the risk factors for and
        mortality associated with hospitalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">poisonings</TIMEX> after
        renal transplantation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Patient population
          This study used data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Renal Data</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> (USRDS), using standard analysis files (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>'s) as
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX>. The variables included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> standard
          analysis files (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>'s), as well as data collection
          methods and validation studies, are listed at the USRDS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">website</ENAMEX>, under 'Researcher's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to the USRDS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Database'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section E</ENAMEX>, 'Contents of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>'s',
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">usrds</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organd</ENAMEX> published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>. The
          demographics of the renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> have been
          previously described (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> USRDS report). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TXUNOS</ENAMEX> was
          used as the primary dataset, and merged with variables
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOSP</ENAMEX> for hospitalization data, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATIENTS</ENAMEX>
          for dates and causes of death as well as causes of renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, as previously reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and treatment factors were those at the
          date of transplant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Recipients</ENAMEX> of organs other than
          kidneys were excluded.
        
        
          Outcome definition
          We conducted an historical cohort study of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, risk factors and associated patient survival
          for hospitalized cases of poisonings (based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diseases-9th Modification</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diagnosis Codes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICD9</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">960.x-989.x</TIMEX>) as a primary
          discharge diagnosis in renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. Only
          the primary discharge diagnosis was used to ensure these
          were active diagnoses, ie, to exclude diagnoses with
          "history of poisonings." These diagnoses include
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overdoses</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> or
          other illicit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. These diagnoses also include most
          known causes of environmental exposures, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minerals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, vaccinations, miscellaneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX>. The first
          hospitalization for poisonings after the first renal
          transplant for a given individual occurring on or after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1994</TIMEX> and before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 July 1998</TIMEX> (which could include a
          repeat transplant), with followup time truncated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> was counted in analysis. Hospitalizations were
          chosen because they were more accessible in the database
          and less subject to interpretation than outpatient cases
          of poisonings, especially since the USRDS database has no
          information on confirmatory studies. Hospitalization data
          for transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> may be unreliable after the
          patient has survived <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">≥</ENAMEX> 3 years post transplant, when
          hospitalization reporting to Medicare for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or younger is no longer required. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
          reporting starts immediately after transplant, regardless
          of preceding dialysis status. All hospitalizations with a
          primary discharge diagnosis for poisonings were extracted
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOSP</ENAMEX>, merged with the transplant file, and
          hospitalizations outside the range of the study period
          were excluded. Hospitalizations for poisonings occurring
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> after renal transplant, including after graft
          failure (censored for patient death), were counted in
          analysis.
        
        
          Variables used in analysis
          The independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> factors
          and hospitalizations for poisonings were examined using
          multivariate analysis with stepwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox Regression</ENAMEX>
          (likelihood ratio method) including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> and donor
          age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> race, gender, weight, pretransplant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dialysis</ENAMEX> (yes/no), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of transplant, duration of
          dialysis prior to transplantation, total follow-up time,
          repeat transplant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> cytomegalovirus serology,
          dialysis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> after transplant (delayed
          graft function, yes/no), rejection (diagnosis or
          treatment) occurring during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</TIMEX> after
          transplant, induction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> therapy, maintenance
          immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of discharge after
          transplant surgery, graft loss (analyzed as a
          time-dependent covariate as previously described), [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          and cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, systemic lupus erythematosus
          (because of the potential effect of corticosteroid
          therapy prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal transplantation</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glomerulonephritis</ENAMEX>). Episodes of rejection were not
          restricted to those occurring in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX>, in
          contrast to studies of allograft function, since there is
          no evidence that late (vs. early) rejection has a
          different impact on poisonings. The total cumulative dose
          of prednisone was not available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>. Both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> and UNOS track the numbers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of prednisone
          administered prior to initial hospital discharge, however
          values were missing for ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> and could not be used as a covariate in the
          above analyses. Maintenance immunosuppressive medication
          use at the time of discharge after transplantation was
          also analyzed as a preexisting covariate. Information on
          use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (other than immunosuppressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medications</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, tobacco, or radiologic procedures
          was not available.
        
        
          Survival times
          We defined patient survival times as the time from
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> renal transplant during the
          study period to the time of death or most recent
          follow-up date (which was considered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX>). For time
          to poisonings, survival time was defined as the time from
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> renal transplant until hospitalization for
          poisonings, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> censored at death, loss to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">followup</ENAMEX>, or end of the study (which was considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>, since this was the most recent
          hospitalization date). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> survival probabilities
          were estimated by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan Meier</ENAMEX> method.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          All analyses were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). Files were merged and converted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> files using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBMS/Copy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conceptual Software</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). Univariate analysis was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX>
          testing for categorical variables and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test for continuous variables. Variables with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> in univariate analysis for a relationship with
          development of hospitalization for poisonings were
          entered into multivariate analysis as covariates.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> analysis was used to construct survival
          plots of time to hospitalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">poisonings</TIMEX> after renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>. Log-log plots were inspected to assess
          for proportionality of hazards over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stepwise Cox</ENAMEX>
          proportional hazards regression (likelihood ratio method)
          was used to model the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of patient factors with
          hospitalized poisonings. In order to control for
          misspecification errors, a random sample of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was excluded from analysis and coefficients
          estimated for this sample. The sample was frozen, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> estimated from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> sample. Because
          hospitalizations for poisonings were uncommon, Poisson
          Regression was used for validation, using the GENLOG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>. In order to estimate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of hospitalizations with all-cause mortality,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX>-nonproportional hazards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regression</ENAMEX> was utilized.
          Times after hospitalization for poisonings were entered
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, all other times were entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as 0</TIMEX>, as previously
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with missing information
          for variables were excluded from the multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
          resulting in models smaller than the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          Hierarchically <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">well-formed models</ENAMEX> were used for the
          assessment of interaction terms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,096</NUMEX> solitary renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Renal Data System</ENAMEX> transplanted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1994 to 30 June 1998</TIMEX>, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,628</NUMEX> had complete
        enough information to calculate survival times. Mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">followup</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.89</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.15 years</TIMEX> (median, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.91 years</TIMEX>). Of the
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were hospitalized with a
        primary discharge diagnosis of poisonings during the study
        period, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> total hospitalizations. The cumulative
        incidence of hospitalizations for poisonings during the
        study period was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3/1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> years. Primary diagnoses
        for hospitalized poisonings are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Suicide
        was not listed as an eventual primary cause of death among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for poisonings, nor was attempted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suicide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E956</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suicide</ENAMEX> and self-inflicted injuries by
        cutting and piercing instrument," or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E958.9</NUMEX> "unspecified
        cause of suicide") listed as a secondary or tertiary
        discharge diagnosis among these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The mean length
        of stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for poisonings was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.05</NUMEX> ±
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.15 days</TIMEX> (range, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-41 days</TIMEX>). Among renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the most common cause of
        hospitalized poisonings was <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>/antidiabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,
        while in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experienced allograft rejection, the
        most common cause of hospitalized poisonings was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        The time to hospitalization for poisonings is shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. As shown, the risk of hospitalized poisonings
        were highest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few months</TIMEX> after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>, with a consistent risk afterward. Figures
        2and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3show</TIMEX> the time to hospitalization for poisoning
        stratified by allograft rejection and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index,
        respectively. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, analysis was limited to patients
        who survived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 6 months</TIMEX> after transplant. In figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the risk of poisonings for all transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> was
        similar for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</TIMEX> by both survival plots and
        log-log plots. Therefore, since this violated the
        proportional hazards assumption, multivariate analysis was
        also performed limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who survived at least
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> after transplant.
        Characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, including
        results of both univariate and multivariate analysis, are
        shown in table 2 (see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In univariate
        analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of
        hospitalized poisonings were low body mass index, graft
        loss, cadaveric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>, rejection within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> after
        transplant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, while male gender was associated
        with reduced risk of poisoning. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Regression</ENAMEX> analysis,
        however, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> factors independently associated with
        hospitalized poisoning were low body mass index and
        allograft rejection. There were no significant interactions
        between covariates, specifically no interactions between
        maintenance or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induction medications</ENAMEX>, or between age and
        body mass index. In analysis limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX>
        and over, low body mass index (as assessed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHR</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.74</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.29</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.82</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>) and rejection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHR</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.88</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.05</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>) were again the only
        factors significantly associated with hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poisonings</ENAMEX>.

        Discussion
        The present study demonstrated that almost all
        hospitalizations for poisonings after renal transplantation
        were due to the use of prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, even
        though ICD9 codes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">960-989.x</ENAMEX> also include poisonings from
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, and anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        Because many immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> are toxic, this
        was not a surprising finding. However, reports from the
        medical literature have been infrequent, as indicated
        previously. In fact, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> search for the terms
        "medication error transplant" yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] and none was returned for the search "medication error
        renal transplant." Therefore, review of the medical
        literature might give a misleading indication of the
        frequency of this complication. Although reported
        hospitalizations for poisonings as a primary diagnosis were
        not common, hospitalizations for poisonings were
        independently associated with increased mortality in renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, and also represented potentially
        avoidable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> with a mean length of stay of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        Anti-neoplastic/immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were the most
        common cause of poisonings in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, as would be
        expected. The current study almost certainly underestimates
        the incidence of serious immunosuppressive drug toxicity in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In addition, renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
        have many potential indications for the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">analgesics/antipyretics</ENAMEX>, post-operative pain among them [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . The frequent occurrence of poisonings due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analgesics</ENAMEX> after renal transplantation may therefore seem
        understandable. However, although the risk of poisonings
        was highest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few months</TIMEX> after transplantation,
        the increase in relative risk in this time was not visually
        remarkable (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and the risk of poisoning continued
        in a constant fashion after transplant. There was certainly
        no early peak followed by a dramatic stabilization in rates
        of poisonings, as has been demonstrated for
        hospitalizations for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytomegalovirus disease</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        contrary to what might have been expected. This suggests
        the possibility that either the dosing or use of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX> may not be adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">optimally</TIMEX> after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Benzodiazepines/tranquilizers</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> most common
        cause of poisonings in this study. It is noteworthy that
        calcineurin inhibitor toxicity may mimic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> or
        nervousness, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] which are common indications for the
        use of benzodiazepines. In addition, many antidepressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> may raise levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcineurin inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Results of the present study raise the possibility that
        indications for treatment with benzodiazepines may actually
        represent toxicities of calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, which
        might be best managed by adjusting the dose of the
        calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Until then, we would suggest that
        the possibility of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxicities</ENAMEX>, including drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, be thoroughly excluded before prescribing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzodiazepines</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Often overlooked is the
        effect of erratic compliance with azole antifungals,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anticonvulsants</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that inhibit or induce
        calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
        The high frequency of poisonings due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insulin/antidiabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> is also not surprising given
        the high frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> among renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> was not an independent risk
        factor for poisonings in the present analysis. This
        suggests that diabetic transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> should be
        monitored with particularly close attention, perhaps in
        concert with regular visits with a pharmacist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] or as
        part of a disease management program to reduce medical
        errors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Considering that almost all causes of hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poisonings</ENAMEX> after renal transplantation were attributed to
        prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, the risk factors for hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poisonings</ENAMEX> in the present study, namely allograft rejection
        and low body mass index, are all the more remarkable. The
        significance of a low body mass index as an independent
        risk factor for poisonings in this analysis as a risk
        factor for hospitalized poisonings, independent of age,
        suggests the possibility of suboptimal dose adjustment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. This particularly applies to calcineurin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, which are lipid soluble and have a large volume
        of distribution. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcineurin inhibitors</ENAMEX> are initiated
        adjusted for patient weight. However, in a small percentage
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> currently recommended doses may still result in
        toxicity. Area-under-the-curve monitoring gives an estimate
        of total drug exposure and may help minimize toxicity,
        particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with unusual clinical responses to
        standard dosing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It would be useful to test this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> in future studies.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of poisonings with allograft rejection
        in this category of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may represent toxicity due to
        bolus intravenous or high dose oral corticosteroid therapy,
        or significant drug-drug interactions in this setting,
        which the database could not determine. However, the
        findings of the present analysis suggest a need for
        providers nationally to reevaluate the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in a systematic fashion after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is certainly not uniform; in some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, the
        primary transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> may continue management of the
        patient up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or more after transplant, while in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> a nephrologist or even primary care physician
        may assume primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> after the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transplant month. It is possible that more
        standardized guidance on dosing and the possibility of drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> would be beneficial. Currently, there are no
        clinical practice guidelines on the dosing of transplant
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, although certain institutional
        guidelines do exist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The present study is limited by use of primary
        hospitalization diagnoses for outcomes. The true frequency
        of poisonings and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> errors in the renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is most likely underestimated. Because of the
        study's retrospective nature, many other factors could not
        be validated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with multiple potential causes for
        admission may not have been included among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        hospitalized poisonings. However, the study is population
        based, and because accurate coding for hospitalization
        discharge is required, is likely to be less subject to
        reporting bias than case reports of poisonings in the
        medical literature.
        The present study could not determine the reason for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poisonings</ENAMEX>. In short, the possibilities of patient error
        vs. provider error could not be distinguished. However,
        consultation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacists</ENAMEX> may reduce both [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Given the looming shortage of nephrologists, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>,
        and other medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] multiple safeguards
        need to be established to minimize the possibility of error
        as much as possible in these complex and challenging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This is particularly true given the significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index and allograft
        rejection with hospitalized poisonings in this analysis,
        which may indicate that more complex and individualized
        methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication dosing</ENAMEX> may be necessary after renal
        transplantation than are currently used. The present study
        identifies specific targets for investigation and
        improvement.
