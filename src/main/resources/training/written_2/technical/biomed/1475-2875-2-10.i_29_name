          Objective of the study
          The purpose of this study was to test whether a
          low-cost outreach education programme, managed by a
          district health management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> (DHMT) in a rural
          district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, could increase private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>'
          knowledge of and compliance with national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
          treatment guidelines. The cornerstone of the programme
          was to train and equip drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> - both mobile
          drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> - to serve
          as unpaid outreach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
          guidelines. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> were to educate the
          drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> during their normal business interactions
          with them, the programme was called "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>."
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Retailers</ENAMEX> consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> and
          private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, many of them unlicensed.
        
        
          Study setting
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 26,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> die each year
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 72</NUMEX> per day [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> changed its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line
          anti-malarial treatment from chloroquine to
          sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Amodiaquine was
          to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. A gazette notice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> to be sold over the counter and
          required that chloroquine be sold only by prescription.
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amodiaquine</ENAMEX> was not mentioned, so it continued to be
          sold over the counter.) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>
          also conducted tests of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> brands and approved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.
          However, because of lack of enforcement, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unapproved SP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> still remained in the market, as well
          as chloroquine and amodiaquine. Furthermore, the gazette
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> was not well-publicized, so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>
          still believed that they were prohibited from selling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bungoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, located in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>,
          is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> endemic area with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900,000</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Home treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
          purchased from private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, is common. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> study
          found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> received home treatment with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-malarial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, purchased mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) or small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> survey
          conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bungoma DHMT</ENAMEX> estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> had
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1500</NUMEX> private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>). The survey revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shopkeepers</ENAMEX> had never received training on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, but
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> gave their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> some instruction on dosages.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 27%</NUMEX> did not know the difference between
          anti-malarials and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-pyretics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Description of the programme
          The main components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-vendor programme
          were: design and production of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> job aid and a
          client awareness aid, orientation of wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>,
          training and equipping of mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale
          counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>, and monitoring.
          With the assistance of the USAID-funded Quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurance Project</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African Medical Research</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Foundation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bungoma DHMT</ENAMEX> first
          conducted focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and individual interviews with
          private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. They
          learned the common misperceptions the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> had about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SP</ENAMEX>
          (e.g., that it is "too strong" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> below one
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year of age</TIMEX>), and the main difficulties faced by drug
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> (e.g., when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> demand anti-malarial drugs
          of doubtful efficacy). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> then worked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyan</ENAMEX>
          graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> to develop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> posters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kiswahili</ENAMEX> to
          communicate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> guidelines to retailers
          and to motivate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to purchase the approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
          • The 
          shopkeeper job aid was for a retailer
          to consult when selling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-malarial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. It was to be
          hung where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> could easily use it when serving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. The job aid listed the clinical symptoms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, a dosage chart of the approved brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> and
          anti-pyretics, treatment advice, and common situations
          faced by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> with suggestions on how to deal
          with them.
          • The 
          client awareness poster was to be
          hung near the entrance of the outlet to generate consumer
          demand for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> approved brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> and to
          communicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> was now available over the counter.
          It urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> properly by using one
          of these recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> which were depicted in their
          actual packaging.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHMT</ENAMEX> next conducted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two three-hour</TIMEX> orientation
          sessions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> to
          gain their cooperation. Following these sessions,
          virtually all agreed to send their counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> to
          the training and let them distribute the job aids and
          posters during their work.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April-May 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five one-day</TIMEX>
          training sessions for mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale
          counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>. Mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> who
          purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> from wholesale general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> (not
          wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX>) and re-sell them by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycle</ENAMEX> to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>; wholesale counter attendants
          are stationary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> or
          general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> who are paid a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> wage. Of approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> identified, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> were trained: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          wholesale pharmacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> wholesale shop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mobile drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. Extensive role
          plays were performed on how to communicate the posters
          and advise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> on where to hang them. Additionally,
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainee</ENAMEX> received a receipt book to record <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recipients</ENAMEX>
          of posters and to obtain their agreement to comply with
          the new guidelines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wholesalers</ENAMEX> were to discuss and
          distribute the job aids at the point of sale: for mobile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vendors</ENAMEX>, at the retail outlet; for wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>,
          at the wholesale outlet. No retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were directly
          trained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX>. At the end of the training, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wholesalers</ENAMEX> received caps and shirts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
          dosage chart on the front.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About three months</TIMEX> after training, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> monitored
          the mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>.
          During the visits, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> checked <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> knowledge
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-question quiz and collected receipts. Although
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> was not able to observe how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX>
          communicated the guidelines to the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, they
          were able to confirm that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> had the
          requisite knowledge and understood every element of the
          shopkeeper job aid.
          The total cost of the programme that would be borne by
          a district was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8300</NUMEX>. The cost breakdown was as follows:
          formative research to learn about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> treatment
          issues (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2000</NUMEX>); design and production of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> shopkeeper
          job aids and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> client posters (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3000</NUMEX>); training of
          mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>,
          including t-shirts, caps and receipt books (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2800</NUMEX>); and
          monitoring of mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and wholesale counter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX>). These costs do not include
          the time spent on this activity by district health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> or by outside technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>, but it does
          include daily allowances to district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> they spent in training or monitoring.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Research design
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six months</TIMEX> after training the mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and
          wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>, the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> employed eight
          mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (unemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> posing as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX>) to assess the
          implementation and impact of the programme. The mystery
          shopper evaluation approach was chosen because it has
          been used effectively elsewhere to assess the quality of
          drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> (primarily dispensing practices for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diarrhoea</ENAMEX> and respiratory infections) without observation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> received clearance for using
          this approach from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering Committee</ENAMEX> overseeing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bungoma District Malaria</ENAMEX> Initiative during their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> meeting, which included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Malaria Control Programme</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of</ENAMEX>
          Health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was taken to follow ethical guidelines, such
          as preserving confidentiality of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight days</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> mystery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>) and one supervisor
          visited each drug outlet included in the sample. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were to have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at home whom
          they believed had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. They asked the outlet
          attendant for advice on what <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to purchase. The males
          were to have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child sick</ENAMEX> at home. They
          specifically asked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaraquin</ENAMEX> (a popular brand of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroquine</ENAMEX>). Both types of mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> were only to
          provide information (e.g., age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, duration of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, etc.) if asked. Immediately after leaving
          the outlet, the shopper discreetly completed a form to
          record the interaction. Some time after both mystery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> visited an outlet, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> entered to check
          stocks, look for job aids, and ask questions to assess
          malaria knowledge.
        
        
          Sample design
          Determining an appropriate sample design posed some
          challenges. First, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> had no control over
          which retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were reached by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX>, it
          was not possible to randomize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> into intervention
          and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">localities</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> had conducted its own survey of private drug outlets
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bungoma</ENAMEX> district <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years</TIMEX> before implementing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor programme</ENAMEX>, it was reluctant to delay
          launching the programme in order to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to
          perform an additional baseline survey focused on private
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prescribing</ENAMEX> practices.
          Hence, the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> opted for a post hoc evaluation,
          recognizing the limitations of this design. Because it
          was not possible to randomize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
          decided that "informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>" would be defined as
          outlets that had received the posters, confirmed either
          by the presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> job aid or the respondent
          stating that it had been received. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outlets</ENAMEX> never having
          received job aids would be defined as controls.
          The study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> was aware that informed and control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> might differ in ways that could affect directly
          the outcomes of interest. To increase internal validity,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> sought to visit control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> that resembled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receipted</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> in terms of location, size, and type.
          In addition, during data analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> examined
          whether the respondent's position (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>), educational level or gender could bias
          results. None of these seemed to be confounders. A post
          hoc stepwise logistic regression analysis found that the
          only variable predicting whether an outlet was labeled
          informed or control was its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (informed
          outlets were more likely to report purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> from
          mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>). However, it is not known if informed and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> differed in other ways not measured by
          the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, such as receptivity to being educated by
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesaler</ENAMEX>.
          For locating informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> started with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> receipts collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX>. They
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">discarded 105</ENAMEX> for the following reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplicates</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, did not have
          names or were outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> were in remote
          sub-locations. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were sought. Of
          these, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) were no longer operational or could not
          be found, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) had never received the job aids, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) were not visited by one mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX>. Hence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>
          of the receipted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> sought were characterized as
          informed. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> which did not receive job aids were
          characterized as controls.
          For control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, the strategy was to select <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> near the receipted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, as well as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> from a neighbouring district (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teso</ENAMEX>). Of the

          did not have anti-malarials in stock, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>) had
          received job aids and were labeled informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX>) never received job aids and were labeled
          controls. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> informed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> control outlets
          were obtained.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> entry and statistical analysis was conducted

          regression were performed to compare informed versus

            Informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were also more likely to purchase

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> available
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 70</NUMEX> different brands of various

            were found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> visited. This represents a
            significant increase from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> brands of anti-malarials
            found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . On average, pharmacies
            had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different brands of various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-malarials</ENAMEX> in
            stock, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and private clinics <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amodiaquine</ENAMEX> (AQ), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, was the most

            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 39%</NUMEX> stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>
            stocked chloroquine (CQ). Drug stocking and source of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were found to differ significantly by type of
            outlet. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> from

            over-the-counter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. In contrast, almost all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacies/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> obtained their

            sold mainly to rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> sold to mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>
            Not only was AQ the most stocked anti-malarial, it
            was also sold most frequently to mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (see
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> was sold to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15%</NUMEX> of mystery
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>, about the same proportion who were sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX>.
            Mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> were never sold injectables and very
            few were sold combinations of anti-malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> were sold antibiotics,
            anti-pyretics or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-malarials</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
            mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) were sold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that were not
            genuine. In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> of visits, the outlet refused to sell
            any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, probably due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeepers</ENAMEX> about
            the legality of selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
            Refusal to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> differed significantly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s
            age and outlet type: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pharmacies</ENAMEX> would not sell <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-malarial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for a
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pharmacies</ENAMEX> would not sell for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
            Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> were told the correct dose differed
            significantly by type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shoppers</ENAMEX> who were sold
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> were much more likely to be told the correct dose
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>) than those sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>) or CQ (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). The fact
            that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> is a single dose treatment may have made it
            easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> to remember. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>
            mistakenly recommended a single dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQ</ENAMEX> instead of
            the required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-day</TIMEX> treatment.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drug</ENAMEX> prices
            The prices paid by the mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> for treating
            their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> as recommended by outlet
            attendants varied widely, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $0.03 to $2.29</NUMEX>.
            These prices included anti-pyretics. On average, the
            price per tablet was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.10</NUMEX>, whereas the price per
            bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.81</NUMEX>. The price within drug brands
            also varied. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tablet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaratab</ENAMEX> (the
            most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX>) ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$.07 to $.21</NUMEX>. Profit
            margins may provide a motive for why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX> was sold so
            frequently. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> had higher profit
            margins than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP drugs</ENAMEX>, and syrups had higher profit
            margins than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>. Average profits for a full child
            dose ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$.03</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fansidar tablets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$.34</NUMEX>
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Malaramed syrup</ENAMEX> (AQ).
          
        
        
          Coverage and acceptability
          
            Coverage
            During the training, about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX> copies of each
            poster were distributed to the wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> and
            mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> for dissemination. Based on the receipts
            collected and the proportion of unreceipted informed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> found during the study, it is estimated that in
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months about 450 to 500</TIMEX> private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were
            reached, with minimal effort from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Job aids acceptability, visibility and use
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 63%</NUMEX> of the informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were displaying
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> job aid and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> poster at the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s visit. The majority of the
            shopkeeper job aids were displayed in a visible
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, such as on a wall. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 62%</NUMEX> of retail
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> said they used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> job aid, and
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> believed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> poster. An
            indication of the usefulness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> job aid
            was that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> of informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> spontaneously used it
            when asked about dosages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP drugs</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          Impact of programme
          
            Knowledge of correct <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> treatment
            During the evaluation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> administered a
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-question <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> knowledge quiz. Informed outlets
            scored significantly better than control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> on
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> questions, and slightly better or
            equivalent on the rest. Informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> had better
            knowledge of important concepts, such as that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> is not
            too strong for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> can be sold in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> that stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> of informed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48/63</NUMEX>) knew the correct dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> for an
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> of controls
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15/35</NUMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.9</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>).
            A total knowledge score was calculated by assigning
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point to a correct answer and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> points for an
            incorrect answer or "don't know". Informed outlets
            scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX> (out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) on average while control outlets
            scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1</NUMEX>. Informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> receiving job aids from
            mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> had significantly higher scores than
            those receiving job aids from wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.2</NUMEX>
            vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.6</NUMEX>). Analysis by education level revealed that, at
            each level, informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> scored higher. When
            compared by outlet type, the intervention appears to
            have had a significant impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX>'
            knowledge, but not private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Stocking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
            As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were
            significantly more likely to stock SP than control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> mainly accounted for the
            striking difference in SP stocking. Overall, there was
            no significant difference in stocking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX>. Informed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> were significantly less likely than control shops
            to stock CQ (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>), as were informed clinics
            relative to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Dispensing practices
            The key <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> dispensing practice is selling an
            approved <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line anti-malarial. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> National
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaria Guidelines</ENAMEX> state that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line drug
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uncomplicated malaria</ENAMEX> in all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and should
            be taken with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-pyretic</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, the
            intervention seems to have had a differential impact by
            outlet type. Of those mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> who went to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> visiting informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were sold
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> at control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.000</NUMEX>). There was no significant differences in the
            other outlet types. Among the informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, those
            receiving job aids from mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> were
            significantly more likely to sell correct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> than
            those who received aids from wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>
            vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>).
            Explicit consumer demand appeared to have an impact.
            Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> of female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (who did not demand CQ)
            were sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CQ</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of male
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (who did demand CQ). If more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> had stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX>, the demand effect might have
            been higher. Controls were twice as likely as informed
            outlets to sell CQ-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> (see
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
            Of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> who were sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37/157</NUMEX>)
            purchased an approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-pyretic</ENAMEX> at
            informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/202</NUMEX>) at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>. More than twice as many mystery
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> were told the correct dose by informed outlets
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>) than by control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>). All told, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> who purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> at informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> both
            received an approved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and were told the correct
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX>, as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> at control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.001</NUMEX>).
            To provide effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> treatment the drug
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> should ask several diagnostic questions. In
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparing</ENAMEX> informed to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>
            inquired about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s age, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> asked about
            symptoms, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> about the duration of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. All of these differences were statistically
            significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). Significantly more informed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) than control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) told the
            mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX> what to do if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s health
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worsens</ENAMEX>.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In areas with a high transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, adverse
        outcomes from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> can only be reduced if malaria
        symptoms are recognized early (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 12-18 hours</TIMEX>
        after onset) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick children</ENAMEX> are treated promptly with
        effective anti-malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in the right doses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
        education campaigns on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> symptoms and the importance
        of prompt and effective treatment are vital. Yet these
        campaigns will be of limited value if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are sold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ineffective drugs</ENAMEX> in the wrong doses. For this reason,
        strengthening the capacity of private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> to
        provide the recommended anti-malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and information
        is important. The challenge is to achieve greater
        performance of private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> at a cost low enough for the
        activity to be scaled up nationally.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> strategies have been advanced for improving the
        practices of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>:
        information, persuasion, incentives and coercion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        To date, very few interventions to change retailer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviours</ENAMEX> through persuasion (or any other means) have
        been systematically introduced and evaluated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . One
        intervention for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacy attendants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, called "face to face educational outreach,"
        resulted in significant short-term improvements in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diarrhoeal</ENAMEX> product sales and communication with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhoea</ENAMEX> treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Other studies have
        indicated that job aids tailored to the needs of the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> can positively affect performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor programme</ENAMEX> combined the strategies
        of persuasion and customized information to achieve
        improved knowledge and dispensing practices among all
        private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. Prior research by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> had revealed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> were considered credible sources of drug
        information for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. Hence, they were designated as
        the "persuaders." Informal interviews indicated that the
        mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> were more enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> of the
        job aids than were the wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>, largely
        because being involved in the programme apparently
        heightened their status. Also, since they were not facing
        queues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>, communicating the guidelines was more
        feasible for mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>.
        The main alternate model for changing shopkeeper
        anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">malarial</ENAMEX> dispensing behaviours has been piloted in
        Kilifi, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> consisted of a series of three
        workshops, each lasting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>, followed by a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> refresher training. The activity seems to have led
        to dramatic improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> prescribing practices among
        a limited number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . But due to the high
        turn-over among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and the shortlife spans of many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlets</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> would require constant identification
        and training, which could be onerous for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kilifi</ENAMEX> approach does not involve the
        wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX>, who seem to play a key role in
        influencing drug purchasing and prescribing practices.
        While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor programme</ENAMEX> did seem to improve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>' knowledge and behaviour in a relatively short time,
        the gap between actual and desired performance was still
        depressingly large. This could be due to several factors.
        First, informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> still had stocks of old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that
        they needed to sell. Virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> operate on
        very limited budgets and cannot afford to discard drugs
        that are no longer recommended. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, confusion and fear
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> were common in the district. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> still
        were not sure whether they were indeed entitled to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>
        over-the-counter. Also, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> still believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SP</ENAMEX>
        was too strong for chldren. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the programme did not
        address the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQ</ENAMEX>, which had become extremely popular
        in the district due to extensive advertising, high profit
        margins for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, and an apparently cheaper price for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> due to misleading packaging. It seems
        likely that the main reason that the programme did not
        significantly affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacists</ENAMEX> relates to the large
        profit margins on AQ syrups, which were only available in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pharmacies</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-vendor programme to have a
        substantial rather than a limited impact, these issues
        would need to be addressed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affordability</ENAMEX> is a critical issue for scaling up. The
        vendor-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor model</ENAMEX> can be considered "high quantity"
        (wide coverage) and "moderate quality" (significant but
        limited improvements) at low cost (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $40</NUMEX> per wholesale
        outlet reached - including mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> - and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        per retail outlet reached). To help other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> to
        launch the activity on their own, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality Assurance</ENAMEX>
        Project has produced a comprehensive how-to manual for
        district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> interested in introducing the
        vendor-to-vendor programme in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. (The manual
        can be downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QAP</ENAMEX> website,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qaproject</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.)
        It should be noted that the evaluation had some serious
        limitations, mostly related to the sampling design.
        Informed and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> might have differed in
        important ways that were not measured but could affect the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> presented. Informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> may have been
        "self-selected"; i.e., control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> may have been
        offered job aids but refused them.
        Another form of selection bias may have resulted from
        the decision to exclude receipted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> in remote
        locations due to logistical considerations. Moreover,
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> were not randomly selected, one cannot
        extrapolate from the study to estimate the percent of all
        outlets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bungoma</ENAMEX> district stocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPs</ENAMEX> or giving correct
        advice to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Hence, additional studies of the
        programme are needed to validate the findings.
        Using mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> yielded important information,
        but it also had some drawbacks. Mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> cannot
        evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> where they would be detected as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outsiders</ENAMEX> (e.g., school dispensaries) or where they are
        required to bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with them (e.g., some private
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinics</ENAMEX>). If the mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> had brought sick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> probably would have dispensed
        more injections. It is also possible that real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, who
        are familiar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeepers</ENAMEX>, would be refused treatment
        less often than unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> (mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor programme</ENAMEX>, a low-cost outreach
        education strategy, seems to have had a moderate impact on
        private drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>' knowledge of and compliance with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> treatment guidelines in a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>.
        Given the difficulty of changing private sector practices,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHMT</ENAMEX> found the results encouraging. Significant
        differences were observed between informed and control
        outlets on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> sold, dosages sold,
        questions asked of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and advice given. The programme
        has also had a positive impact on knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
        treatment guidelines, especially among retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>
        with less education. The programme appears to have had the
        greatest impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>. These effects could be
        heightened if the programme addressed several issues more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensively</ENAMEX>, such as building consumer demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> and
        sustaining the interest of wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> in the
        activity, perhaps through an incentive programme. (The
        district launched a "neighbour-to-neighbour" programme in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> to raise public awareness about correct malaria
        treatment.)
        However, this programme will not be able to achieve a
        high degree of success without national policies and
        programmes addressing the profit margins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SP</ENAMEX> versus AQ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, advertising and sales of unapproved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, the
        enforcement of correct dosage labeling, and retrieval from
        the market of inefficacious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the national
        government needs to be more active in educating consumers
        about the importance of early recognition and prompt
        treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, why <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> is the preferred <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, and which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have been approved. Coupled with
        these national activities, district-level vendor-to-vendor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programmes</ENAMEX> would probably have greater impact.
