        Endochondral ossification is the process by which
        mesenchymal cells condense at specific <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and
        differentiate into chondrocytes, forming the cartilage
        anlagen that are the model for the future bone. The cells
        in the center of the anlagen, which are initially immature,
        undergo an ordered differentiation program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] (also
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chondrocyte maturation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ): the chondrocytes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferate</ENAMEX>, become pre-hypertrophic, and then undergo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix calcification</ENAMEX>. The calcified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage</ENAMEX> is then invaded by blood vessels that bring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> and osteoclasts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> is formed. Each step
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage maturation</ENAMEX> occurs in a precise and tightly
        regulated manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Disruptions of this process cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Endochondral ossification occurs in embryonic skeletal
        formation, in skeletal growth and fracture healing.
        Homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> are required for proper
        patterning of skeletal elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The functional role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hox genes</ENAMEX> in skeletal growth and development has been
        clearly demonstrated, but how they control the
        differentiation of specific tissues is not well understood.
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encode transcription factors that regulate the
        expression of yet unidentified target genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In
        order to identify such target genes and to better
        understand the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hox genes</ENAMEX> in cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and maturation, we established 
        in vitro culture systems for primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse rib chondrocytes</ENAMEX>.
        Previously, we generated transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that
        overexpress the homeobox transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> in the
        thoracic region, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> is normally expressed ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        and unpublished results). The transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibit
        profound cartilage defects, predominantly in ribs and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebral</ENAMEX> column, and severity of defects depends on
        transgene dosage. The abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> is characterized
        by an accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes and
        reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage maturation</ENAMEX>. The structural rigidity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rib cartilage</ENAMEX> is greatly compromised, fatally interfering
        with pulmonary function, and vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> is so weak
        that the skeleton often disassembles during skeletal
        preparation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . These results suggest that Hoxc-8
        continues to regulate skeletal development well beyond
        pattern formation in a tissue-specific manner, presumably
        by controlling the progression of cells along the
        chondrocyte differentiation pathway. We found a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> upon overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxd-4</ENAMEX> in our transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappen</ENAMEX>, manuscript in preparation), whereas
        overexpression of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isl-1</ENAMEX> did not cause abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> but other
        developmental defects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 9</NUMEX> ] . The observation that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage</ENAMEX> is affected by misregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> and
        Hoxd-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, but not by a divergent homeobox gene, indicates
        that the capacity to regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage differentiation</ENAMEX> is
        specific to homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> subclass. It also
        suggests that Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be involved in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrodysplasias</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cartilage disorders</ENAMEX>. We
        envisioned that well-defined 
        in vitro culture systems would allow
        us to further characterize the cellular and molecular basis
        of abnormal chondrocyte differentiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hox</ENAMEX> transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Detailed knowledge of regulatory mechanisms in
        endochondral ossification will be essential for strategies
        to manipulate chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation
        and maturation in skeletal growth and development,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteochondrodysplasias</ENAMEX> and fracture healing.
        The 
        in vitro chondrocyte culture systems
        we utilized here consisted of high-density cultures of
        primary rib chondrocytes from neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The micromass
        culture system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] provides the three-dimensional
        environment needed for chondrogenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> maturation
        and hypertrophy. The system also allows the investigation
        of the continuous program of differentiation, maturation
        and hypertrophy in the same culture. The cellular phenotype
        in culture was characterized by morphology and
        extra-cellular matrix (ECM) production. Chondrocyte
        maturation was assessed on the basis of cell proliferation,
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypertrophy</ENAMEX>, alkaline phosphase activity and
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Collagen type II</ENAMEX> and type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. Apoptosis</ENAMEX> was
        investigated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
        transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triposphate nick end
        labeling). High density bulk cultures were used to assess
        the capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        for cell proliferation and differentiation. Proliferation
        of chondrocytes 
        in vivo was assayed by BrdU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX>, and gene expression was analyzed by
        real-time quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        We previously reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] that Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        exhibit profound defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, particularly in the
        rib <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> and vertebral column. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> is
        structurally insufficient and weak, contains fewer
        hypertrophic chondrocytes, displays much reduced staining
        for sulfated proteoglycans, and consists predominantly of
        immature chondrocytes, with a high <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
        proliferating cells. These results point to a role of
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage maturation</ENAMEX> and
        chondrocyte differentiation. A similar phenotype is found
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxd</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kappen</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
        preparation) indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> transcription factors
        regulate chondrocyte development. To examine this function
        in more detail, we employed a culture system that
        facilitates chondrocyte maturation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> formation,
        and closely recapitulates the 
        in vivo situation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micromass</ENAMEX> system has been used extensively for studies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> formation from limb mesenchyme [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ]
        and also for culture of chondrocytes in high density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        . Here, we have adapted the system to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neonatal</ENAMEX> mouse rib
        chondrocytes, to study the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> in chondrocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX>.
        As established previously, chondrocytes in micromass
        culture are able to progress along their differentiation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> to hypertrophy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In cultures of neonatal rib
        chondrocytes, we find essentially the same results. As
        shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, histology (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panels A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) and
        immunohistochemistry for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagens II and X</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        Panels C, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) revealed appropriate cellular
        morphology, as well as increase in cell size towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels E</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>), and extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> production (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel F</ENAMEX>). BrdU incorporation
        identified proliferating cells early in the culture (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>), while virtually no dividing cells were
        detected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel L</ENAMEX>). The proportion of
        proliferating cells was lower at the beginning of the
        culture (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, Panel A), reflecting our observation
        that cells may need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1-2 days</TIMEX> to adapt to the culture
        conditions. Maximal proliferation was found on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 3</TIMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, consistent with the presence of predominantly
        proliferating cells in the culture (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel</ENAMEX>
        A and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Panel I). Manifesting their progression to
        hypertrophy, the size of cells increased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel</ENAMEX>
        B), with the majority of cells progressed to hypertrophy by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15</TIMEX> (see also Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Concommittant with cartilage
        ECM deposition, there was an increase in Alkaline
        Phosphotase activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX>). As cells matured
        towards hypertrophy, there was also increased cell death in
        our micromass cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Panel D</ENAMEX>). Apoptosis, as
        assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX>, was present from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> on, and the
        percentage of positive cells increased with time in
        culture. Similar results were reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . These results demonstrate that the cultured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rib chondrocytes</ENAMEX> behaved in a similar manner as
        chondrocytes 
        in vivo . Taken together, primary rib
        chondrocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> neonates grown in micromass culture
        display cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX>, proliferation, maturation
        and hypertrophy, recapitulating the chondrocyte maturation
        program 
        in vivo . These results establish the
        utility of this 
        in vitro system to investigate the
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hox genes</ENAMEX> and other transcription factors in
        endochondral ossification.
        Rib chondrocytes from neonatal Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        were cultured in the micromass system, and the cultures
        were examined for the same parameters described above.
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3shows</TIMEX> that Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic chondrocytes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologically</ENAMEX> appeared normal and were able to produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagens II and X</ENAMEX>, and sulfated proteoglycans (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels C</ENAMEX>,
        G, I, D, H, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> and B, F respectively). There was no
        discernable difference in the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> to grow or mature in this system (compare to
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels A-H</ENAMEX>). These data indicate that
        chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have the capacity
        to differentiate and mature normally under the culture
        conditions described here. This finding was unexpected in
        light of the severe cartilage defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . However, the possibility remained that,
        despite apparently normal maturation, proliferation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> could be affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX>. Such an effect would be consistent with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of immature, proliferating chondrocytes in
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . We therefore characterized
        cell proliferation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>.
        
        In vivo labeling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> was
        performed to investigate the proliferative status of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Previously, we [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] found that upon overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX>, the vertebral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartilages</ENAMEX> accumulate immature chondrocytes, and we showed
        that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are proliferating cells by virtue of
        staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen</ENAMEX> (PCNA). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of proliferating chondrocytes could be
        explained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different scenarios: ( 
        i ) There is a block in differentiation
        that prevents cells from entering hypertrophy. The
        proportion of hypertrophic cells was indeed reduced in
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, but progression to hypertrophy was
        not completely inhibited. ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX> ) There is increased recruitment of
        precursor cells into the chondrocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lineage. This
        proposition is difficult to investigate, and no evidence is
        available at this stage. ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX> ) The rate of cell division is
        increased. Then, the cell cycle duration of proliferating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> should be shorter. ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX> ) The cell cycle time of
        proliferating chondrocytes is lengthened, resulting in a
        greater number of cells in the steady-state pool of
        proliferating cells. To distinguish these latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        possibilities, we analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo . Multiple sections were
        examined from each embryo and showed incorporation of BrdU
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after labeling. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> representative
        results for the immunohistochemical detection of BrdU
        incorporation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Panels A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). To
        directly compare cell proliferation between embryos of
        different genotype, sections of vertebral centers were
        assessed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel E</ENAMEX> shows
        results from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> isolated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 15.75</TIMEX> post coitum. The
        differences in cell number/section of vertebral center
        indicate that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> were more progressed in
        overall growth than others, and thus had larger vertebral
        centers with more cells overall. Maturation was consistent
        within a given litter (compare samples <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2, to 7, 8 and 5</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 11, 12</TIMEX>, respectively). The fraction of cells positive
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 7.8 and 14.4%</NUMEX>, with a
        trend towards lower rates of incorporation in
        developmentally older embryos with higher Hoxc-8 transgene
        expression levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA/TA TR</ENAMEX>/+; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel F</ENAMEX>). While
        additional measurements at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> stages of development
        would be needed to confirm whether this is a continuous
        trend for cartilage development in late pregnancy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
        overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, these results were initially
        unexpected: The phenotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> at
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17.5 days</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 2 days later</TIMEX> than assayed here) is
        characterized by accumulation of proliferating cells.
        Intuitively, the expectation would be that greater rates of
        BrdU incorporation should be found. However, accumulation
        of proliferating cells can also result from a slow-down of
        the cell cycle, in form of a lower rate of BrdU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX>. It is intriguing to note that reduced BrdU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX> is particularly detected in developmentally
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vertebral centers</ENAMEX> are made up of a
        larger number of cells, reflecting a longer duration since
        commitment of the precursors to chondrocyte fate. It should
        also be noted that both genotypes assayed here develop
        cartilage defects, which may explain the relatively
        moderate differences. A prediction from these data is that
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subsequent days</TIMEX>, or upon longer labeling intervals, even
        lower rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation should be detected.
        Quantification of such findings, and 
        in vivo measurements of cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, however, require pulse-chase experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        ] , which involve large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and are very
        time-consuming.
        Instead, we sought to investigate the proliferative
        capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by
        using 
        in vitro assays. We performed cell
        cycle assays on primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> isolated from rib
        cages of transgenic and control neonates. Chondrocytes were
        placed into high density bulk cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , where they
        initially continued to proliferate, and later
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiated</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> nodules present by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX>
        after plating. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> representative cultures
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels A-C</ENAMEX>), and the growth curve for rib
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in high density bulk cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel</ENAMEX>
        D). From this, we were able to estimate a mean doubling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17-19 hours</TIMEX>. This conforms well to previous
        published measurements for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chick limb chondrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> chondrocytes 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The linear phase of
        growth was observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 3 and 4</TIMEX>, and therefore the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hour</TIMEX> time point was chosen for analysis of cell cycle
        kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic chondrocytes 
        in vitro . First, we established the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting</ENAMEX> (FACS) assay using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryonic fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, and then we assayed rib
        chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in
        high density bulk cultures. From these cultures, cells were
        removed at various timepoints after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation and
        subjected to Flow cytometry. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Panels A-E"</ENAMEX>) shows a
        typical result for fibroblasts. The same readout was used
        for cultures of primary rib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, Panels
        F-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>). As cells go through the cell cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content
        increases, and this is reflected in a concomitant increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation. Upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, the signal for DNA
        content is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, while overall BrdU
        incorporation increases with every subsequent cell cycle.
        These assays allowed us to determine the fraction of cells
        in each stage of the cell cycle (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, Panel A), and
        established FACS analysis as a valuable tool for the
        analysis of chondrocyte proliferation.
        Interestingly, when primary chondrocytes from Hoxc-8
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were assayed, they showed the same cell
        cycle kinetics as chondrocytes from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        Essentially similar proportions of cells in S phase were
        found in all cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel B</ENAMEX>). This was
        regardless of levels of expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel B</ENAMEX>) which increases with increasing
        transgene dosage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 23</ENAMEX> ] . These data indicate that, after
        appropriate time in culture, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> were
        able to proliferate normally, at least over the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
        duration of the assay.
        Given our inability to distinguish Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic
        cells from controls by parameters for either cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> or proliferation, we sought to determine
        which molecular differences exist in our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the documented deficiencies in cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . To this end, we analyzed gene expression
        in freshly isolated primary rib chondrocytes from Hoxc-8
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Real-time quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was
        performed. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> expression is
        elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Differences also exist between controls and transgenics in
        expression levels for several genes involved in cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> II expression (splice
        form A) is increased, as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ihh</ENAMEX> mRNA, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bmp-4</ENAMEX> and p107
        expression are decreased. Taken together, these results
        establish alterations in gene expression upon
        overexpression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> in the developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skeleton</ENAMEX>.
        The biological corollaries of changes in gene expression
        profiles are noteworthy in that they may provide evidence
        on the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hox genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, as well
        as on the consequences of Hox gene overexpression. In
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>, we found increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Collagen II</ENAMEX> splice form A mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . This
        is consistent with our earlier finding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>-fold
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Collagen II</ENAMEX> mRNA expression by in situ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and increased numbers of immature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sox-5</ENAMEX>, which
        is normally expressed in proliferating chondrocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
        ] , is elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic cells, again
        consistent with accumulation of immature chondrocytes.
        Unexpected was the elevated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagen X</ENAMEX> mRNA,
        a marker for hypertrophic cells. As fewer hypertrophic
        cells are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transgenics</ENAMEX>, and cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> is delayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would expect to see decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagen X</ENAMEX> mRNA levels [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . Yet, the data clearly indicate that mRNA expression
        is elevated in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rib chondrocytes</ENAMEX>. This could be
        either from increased <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagen X</ENAMEX> mRNA transcription within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prehypertrophic</ENAMEX> and hypertrophic cells or from ectopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">activation of Collagen X</ENAMEX> transcription in proliferating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>. Whether either of these possibilities would
        also increase <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Collagen X</ENAMEX> expression at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level
        remains to be investigated. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen X</ENAMEX>
        expression has been shown to be induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">by Bmp-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ,
        which is overexpressed in our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bmp-2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> has a positive effect on chondrocyte
        proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , and can induce <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hedgehog</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX>)
        expression in responsive cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . We find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ihh</ENAMEX> mRNA
        elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX> can induce Bmp expression in proliferating cells,
        further increasing positive effects on chondrocyte
        proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX> decreases the
        rate of progression to hypertrophy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] , again
        consistent with an accumulation of proliferating cells in
        our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Whether the elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ihh</ENAMEX> mRNA
        levels originate from increased expression in cells that
        make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ihh</ENAMEX> normally (prehypertrophic and hypertrophic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>) or from ectopic activation by the Hox
        transcription factors in proliferating cells, remains to be
        investigated. Greater numbers of prehypertrophic cells are
        unlikely to account for elevated expression of
        prehypertrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> markers: histological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> show no increase in
        prehypertrophic cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTHrP</ENAMEX> receptor mRNA
        levels are unchanged in cells from transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). These data also suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> signaling [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] is only moderately affected by overexpression of
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. We found the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p107</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bmp-4</ENAMEX> mRNA
        to be decreased, which, if reflected in reduced protein
        levels, would be consistent with the phenotype of delayed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage maturation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hox</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>: As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bmp-4</ENAMEX>
        was shown to have a positive effect on hypertrophy and
        inhibitory effect on proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] , decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bmp-4</ENAMEX> expression would be expected to promote chondrocyte
        proliferation. p107 has been shown to be required for exit
        from the cell cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] , and reduced p107 expression
        is associated with deregulated proliferation. Also,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> without p107 expression fail to respond to
        inhibitory signals from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGFs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . The relationship to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated Fgf</ENAMEX> receptor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mRNA levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic
        cells, however, remains to be clarified. The same caveat
        applies to elevated expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic cells
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p130</TIMEX>, which is also known to be linked to cell cycle
        exit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . While the profile of gene
        expression changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is suggestive
        of interactions between the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX>, further
        studies will be required to mechanistically link the gene
        expression differences to the maturational delay in the
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, the gene expression profiles of primary
        chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> display notable
        differences in the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of chondrocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> in a pattern largely consistent with delayed
        chondrocyte maturation 
        in vivo . These results now allow us
        to investigate whether any of these molecules is directly
        regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> transcription factors in chondrocytes. It
        is also remarkable, as apparent from our cell culture
        results, that cells with obvious molecular differences
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">downstream of Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> expression can be modulated to
        resemble a normal chondrocyte phenotype after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in
        culture.
      
      
        Discussion
        Our studies of chondrocytes from Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        reveal several interesting results: 
        in vivo , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> remain
        relatively immature, with few progressing to hypertrophy in
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Combined with the fact that some,
        albeit fewer, hypertrophic cells are present, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of proliferating chondrocytes suggests that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> regulates the rate of progression of chondrocytes to
        maturity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In line with this interpretation, the 
        in vivo BrdU incorporation assays
        suggested that cell cycle progression of chondrocytes may
        be decreased in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with higher Hoxc-8
        transgene expression levels. If fewer immature cells enter
        the cell cycle in a given time interval, this is consistent
        with, and would explain the increased steady-state numbers
        of chondrocytes upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX>. This could
        occur through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different mechanisms: ( 
        i ) Hoxc-8 actively recruits cells into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chondrocyte</ENAMEX> lineage and maintains them in the
        proliferating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; or ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX> ) Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> inhibits a specific step in
        chondrocyte maturation. In order to distinguish between
        these possibilities, we sought to employ cell culture
        assays with well-established parameters for chondrocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and maturation. Interestingly, chondrocytes
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> tansgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> behaved undistinguishable
        from control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> under all conditions tested. No
        differences were found in capacity to differentiate in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micromass</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), or in high density cultures (not
        shown), and proliferative indices are comparable (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), irrespective of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene dosage</ENAMEX>. The latter
        could be explained by the fact that the FACS analyses were
        done at the time of greatest proliferation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>
        after culture initiation, which may allow transgenic cells
        to recover to a normal phenotype. However, we did not
        detect any differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few days</TIMEX> of culture by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> or histology. Cellular differences must exist at
        the time the cells are taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> (which would
        be expected to die as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic), and indeed
        molecular differences exist (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Yet, the cell
        culture conditions either quickly reverse cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> or support normal chondrocyte maturation.
        Alternatively, it is conceivable that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        could be silenced as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are isolated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>,
        returning cells to their normal phenotype. There is little
        evidence to support this possibility as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> is expressed
        normally in our chondrocyte cultures (data not shown), and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> used to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> contains a
        cartilage-specific element (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cormier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kappen</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        results) that is active in chondrocytes. Yet, even if
        transgene expression was reduced in culture, the important
        implication of our results is that the downstream
        biological effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 6 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
        overexpression 
        in vivo are reversible. From these
        results, we postulate that the cartilage defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is mediated by absence of factors/signals
        that are present in the culture medium. Serum-free
        conditions and supplementation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> molecules
        would be one strategy to investigate this further. An
        interesting, albeit preliminary, finding from our gene
        expression studies is that chondrocytes from Hoxc-8
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> display gene expression profiles that
        are indicative for immature chondrocytes, but not totally
        identical. This suggests that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> transcription
        factors may, in addition to the delay in chondrocyte
        maturation, induce specific changes in gene expression. By
        extending the collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes, or screening
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">microarrays</TIMEX>, it may thus be possible to identify
        specific targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> transcription factors in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results support the conclusion that factors in
        serum-containing medium provide the environment in which
        Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> are capable of reverting to
        a normal cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> induced changes
        in chondrocytes are reversible under certain conditions.
        This has important implications for the identification of
        the transcriptional targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hox</ENAMEX> transcription factors.
        In our system, the biological effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hox genes</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> can be modulated by external factors, and this
        finding points to the importance of gene-environment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> as modulators of Hox gene function.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse rib</ENAMEX> chondrocytes
          The preparation of primary rib chondrocytes from
          neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is a modification of the method used by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lefebvre et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, newborn FVB <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacrificed</ENAMEX>, and the ventral regions of rib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> were
          dissected in sterile conditions to release soft tissues.
          Rib cages were transferred to phosphate buffered saline
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) and washed extensively. Cells were dissociated in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ml tubes by enzymatic digestion with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> Collagenase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Worthington Biochemical</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collagenase Type 2 - CLS 2</ENAMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trypsin/EDTA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen/Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at
          37Â°C, or until the soft tissues were floating in the
          solution. The solution was aspirated, leaving the rib
          cages on the bottom of the tube. The ribcages were washed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and fresh <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagenase</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was added

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissociated</ENAMEX>. The enzymatic reaction was stopped with an
          equal volume of tissue culture medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>.
          The cells were filtered through a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Î</NUMEX>¼m <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> strainer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>) and pelleted by centrifugation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. The pellet was washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, cells were
          counted, and adjusted for desired cell density.
        
        
          Primary chondrocyte high density bulk
          cultures
          For analysis of cell cycle parameters, we kept primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in high density bulk cultures, as this
          allows for recovery of cells for flow cytometry. These
          cultures undergo chondrocyte maturation with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> to hypertrophy and formation of cartilage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modules</ENAMEX>. Briefly, cells were plated on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mm dishes

          Assessment of morphological and histological
          parameters of micromass cultured cells
          During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>, micromass cultures were
          observed directly by phase contrast light microscopy.
          After that, cultures were harvested, washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, fixed
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraformaldehyde</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>, dehydrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graded</ENAMEX> series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ethanol</ENAMEX> and paraffin-embedded for
          subsequent analysis. We used histochemical staining with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eosin</ENAMEX> to ascertain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell morphology</ENAMEX>; and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcian Blue</ENAMEX> at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] to detect cartilage matrix
          sulfated glucosaminoglycans as described before [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          The production of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Collagen type II</ENAMEX> was assessed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> using a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mouse type II Collagen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>), and secondary antibody
          and colorimetric reaction kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histostain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zymed</ENAMEX>).
          Cell proliferation was assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation.
          Cells were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>), harvested
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hrs and paraffin-embedded. Cells with BrdU

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zymed</ENAMEX>). Cell size was determined by measuring cell
          diameter microscopically, and mean cell size was
          calculated. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as
          follows: Cells were rinsed in cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tris</ENAMEX>-buffered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saline</ENAMEX>), scrapped from the plate, homogenized in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce Chemicals</ENAMEX>). Alkaline phosphatase
          activity in the supernatant was determined
          spectrophotometrically at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> nm wavelength as the amount
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-nitrophenol released from the substrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p-nitrophenyl phosphate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALP10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Type X Collagen</ENAMEX>
          deposition in extracellular matrix was analyzed by

          Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          The generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the
          characterization of their phenotype have been published [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are generated in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] by crossing a
          transactivator strain (harboring a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> in which
          expression of the transcriptional transactivator <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VP16</ENAMEX> is
          under control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hoxc-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] ) to a
          transresponder strain (that carries as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, which is silent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VP16</TIMEX>;
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] ). Upon combination of both transgenes, the
          Hoxc-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> transresponder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is activated, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
          becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpressed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This system also allows
          the generation of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with increased gene
          dosage by superimposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene loci</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygosity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 44</NUMEX> ] . For the studies reported here,
          we used the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T239</NUMEX> transactivator and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IE-c8-254</ENAMEX>
          transresponder <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. All procedures involving animals
          were reviewed and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care and Use Committee</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNMC</ENAMEX>.
          Hoxd-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were generated using the same
          transactivator strain crossed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IE-d4-70</ENAMEX>
          transresponder strain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Maintenance and genotyping
          of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was done as described before [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 23</ENAMEX> ]
          . Unless otherwise noted, cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were obtained
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> hemizygous for both transgenes.
          All transgenes were maintained on a homogenous FVB
          inbred genetic background, and normal FVB <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were used
          as controls unless mentioned otherwise.
        
        
          In vivo BrdU incorporation
          To assess chondrocyte proliferation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoxc</ENAMEX>-8
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we performed 
          in vivo BrdU labeling experiments.
          BrdU labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPN202</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was

          following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. Staining of
          sections for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation was done using the Zymed
          BrdU staining kit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horseradish Peroxidase</ENAMEX>, and
          development with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. Counterstaining was
          done with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hematoxylin</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX>. Sections of

          slides for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and cell counting was done
          independently by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> technologists without knowledge of
          sample genotype. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          independent experiments and were averaged to
          cells/section to normalize for potential growth

          Primary rib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> were prepared as described
          above and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 Ã— 10 5cells</NUMEX>/well were placed into culture in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-well plates. Medium was changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. Proliferation
          was assessed by cell counting, and maturation was
          ascertained visually as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage nodule</ENAMEX> formation, and
          histochemically by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcian Blue</ENAMEX> staining. Cell cycle
          kinetics were measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation and flow
          cytometry for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content at various time points after
