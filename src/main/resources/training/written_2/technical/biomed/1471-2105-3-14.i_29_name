        Accurate computational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function analysis is an
        important way of extracting value from primary sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Due to the large amount of data, automated systems
        seem unavoidable (at least for initial, prioritizing
        steps). Such efforts are complicated, for a variety of
        reasons. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> belong to large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, as
        suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayhoff</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are often
        composed of subfamilies related to each other by gene
        duplication events. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingram</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] showed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human α</ENAMEX>, β, and γ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of hemoglobins are related to each
        other by gene duplications. Gene duplication allows one
        copy to assume a new biological role through mutation,
        while the other copy preserves the original functionality [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Hence, subfamilies often differ in their biological
        functionality yet still exhibit a high degree of sequence
        similarity.
        Other complications in functional analysis include:
        ignoring the multi-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>; error
        propagation caused by transfer of information from
        previously erroneously annotated sequences; insufficient
        masking of low complexity regions; and alternative splicing
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Typically, automated sequence function analysis relies
        on pairwise sequence similarity and programs such as BLAST
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] or FASTA [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Annotating a sequence by
        transferring annotation from its most similar sequence(s)
        tends to produce overly specific annotation. In contrast,
        analyses using profile search algorithms such as HMMER
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://hmmer.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wustl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/and Pfam</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] classify sequences
        too generally. They recognize that a query sequence belongs
        to a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (or, to be more precise, indicate which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>(s) the query is likely to contain), but do not
        subclassify the sequence.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> scenarios can cause misleading predictions
        when using pairwise sequence similarity alone for
        annotation: (i) not having a known annotated representative
        of the correct subfamily because incomplete sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> and/or gene loss (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) unequal
        rates of evolution (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The case of trying to
        annotate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> is of particular interest. Pairwise similarity
        based methods alone cannot recognize that a new sequence
        does not belong in any currently known subfamily (e.g.
        "orphan" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX>), because every
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is most similar to something. In contrast, when
        constructing a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, this case is easy to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observe</ENAMEX> (as illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotator</ENAMEX> can
        use phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> analysis to place a new sequence in
        the subfamily structure of a gene tree of known sequences.
        This approach was called "phylogenomics" by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        It would be desirable to automate this procedure, but the
        best automated methods for subfamily annotation, such as
        the COGs database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , are clustering methods that do
        not directly use phylogenetic analysis.
        It is infeasible to completely automate functional
        analysis, because it is impossible to precisely define what
        protein "function" means. However, a principle of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenomics</ENAMEX> is that orthologous sequences (that diverged
        by speciation) are more likely to conserve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function
        than paralogous sequences (that diverged by gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthology</ENAMEX> and paralogy are well defined and
        can be inferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. One useful and
        automatable phylogenomics approach would be as follows: if
        a novel sequence has orthologs, annotation can be
        transferred from them (as in best BLAST analysis); if there
        are no orthologs, the sequence is classified as just a
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam/InterPro</ENAMEX> analysis) and flagged as
        possibly the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a novel subfamily. At
        the core of such approaches stands therefore the
        distinction between orthologs and paralogs, and hence the
        ability to discriminate between duplication and speciation
        events on a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Various efficient algorithms to
        infer gene duplications on a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> by comparing it to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX> have been described (for example: by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eulenstein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ). We developed a
        simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algorithm</ENAMEX> (named SDI for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speciation</ENAMEX> Duplication
        Inference) that appears to solve this problem even more
        efficiently on realistic data sets, though it has an
        asymptotic worst-case running time that is less favorable [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] .
        In practice, phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are unreliable. Errors
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> will produce spurious inferred duplications. This
        is obviously problematic if duplications are to be used as
        indicators of potential functional changes. Therefore,
        instead of determining the orthologs of a query sequence on
        just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, inference could be performed over
        bootstrap resampled gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] to estimate of the
        reliability of the assignments. Here we describe and test a
        procedure - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resampled Inference of Orthologs</ENAMEX>) -
        which allows to perform such analyses in an automated
        fashion. We present results of using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> to analyze a plant
        ( 
        A. thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ) and an animal
        (the nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ) proteome.
      
      
        Algorithm
        
          Definitions
          Orthologs are defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that diverged by a
          speciation event. Paralogs are defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          diverged by a duplication event [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Other concepts
          derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> can be useful for functional
          prediction. We introduce and justify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> such concepts
          ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologs</ENAMEX>", "ultra-paralogs", and
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX>"):
          Careless use of orthology relationships without
          examining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> itself can lead to incorrect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. In the example shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, the human
          query sequence has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> orthologous sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat sequences</ENAMEX> are related to each other by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (or even both) of them might
          have undergone functional modification after their
          divergence. Given a procedure that gave a list of
          orthologues for the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene query</ENAMEX>, such situations
          should be revealed by only partial (or complete absence
          of) agreement between the annotations of the wheat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX>. Now consider the situation in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>. This
          is trickier, since in this case <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> ortholog will be
          reported for the query sequence, but it will be just as
          dangerous to transfer annotation. We do not attempt to
          solve this problem (the solution is careful manual
          analysis of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>) but an automated procedure can
          warn that this situation might be present. For this
          purpose we introduce the concept of
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologs</ENAMEX>":
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Definition 1</ENAMEX>. Given a rooted gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with duplication or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speciation</ENAMEX> assigned to each of
          its internal nodes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologous</ENAMEX>
          if and only if each internal node on their connecting
          path represents a speciation event.
          Hence, the query sequences in Figure 3have no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">super-orthologs.</ENAMEX> In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, and wheat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in Figure 1Aare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologs</ENAMEX> pf the human
          query sequence. By definition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologs</ENAMEX> of a
          given sequence are a subset of its orthologs.
          Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> underwent multiple recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, resulting in large species specific
          sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, such as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-transmembrane
          proteins acting as odorant and chemosensory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . For query <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> belonging to such sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, orthologs (if present) are less effective for
          predicting specific information. In these cases, paralogs
          of the same (sub) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> might be more informative for
          functional prediction (as long as the duplications indeed
          happened "late" in evolutionary times). To formalize
          this, we introduce the concept of "ultra-paralogs":
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Definition 2</ENAMEX>. Given a rooted gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with duplication or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speciation</ENAMEX> assigned to each of
          its internal nodes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are ultra-paralogous if
          and only if the smallest subtree containing them both
          contains only internal nodes representing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4illustrates</NUMEX> the concept of ultra-paralogs. It
          follows from definition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ultra-paralogous
          sequences must occur in the same species.
          Often, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> construct a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and then
          informally use "subtrees" (clades) to make inferences
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about sequences</TIMEX> (without regard to duplications and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speciations</ENAMEX>). We introduce this concept into our
          procedure as well, formalized as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX>"
          (illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>):
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Definition 3</ENAMEX>. Given a completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> and rooted gene tree, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtree</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of a sequence 
          q are defined as all sequences
          derived from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -level parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">node</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> , except 
          q itself (the level of 
          q itself is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and so
          forth).
          Subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> can be useful if there is (partial)
          agreement among their annotations (for example: if the
          subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of a query are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +-dependent
          isocitrate dehydrogenase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +-dependent isocitrate
          dehydrogenase we can suppose that the query is likely to
          be a isocitrate dehydrogenase, but it is not possible to
          determine whether it is dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +). If
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX> lack any agreement in their
          annotations a useful inference is not possible (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          for a more detailed discussion). Furthermore, orthologs
          that are not also subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> can be misleading
          (for a more detailed discussion of this, see below, and
          see Figures 10and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11for</NUMEX> examples).
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> procedure
          This basic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> procedure is as follows. For a simple
          example with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> bootstrap resamples, see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
          We use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] as a
          source of high quality curated multiple sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> and profile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HMMs (Hidden Markov Models</ENAMEX>, see [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] for a review), as well as programs from the HMMER
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">package http://hmmer.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wustl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> can easily be
          adapted to work with different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of alignments and
          different alignment programs. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree reconstruction</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> joining (NJ) algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] is used, since
          it is reasonably fast, can handle alignments of large
          numbers of sequences, and does not assume a molecular
          clock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX> recreates the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> as long as
          the input distances are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and is
          effective even if additivity is only approximated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
          .
          
          Input: A query <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence 
          Q with unknown function.
          A curated multiple alignment 
          A from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> database for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that 
          Q belongs to (as determined by
          hmmpfam from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMMER</ENAMEX> package).
          A profile HMM 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family that Q
          belongs to.
          
          Output: A list (as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins orthologous</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX> , sorted according to a bootstrap
          confidence value (based on orthology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthology</ENAMEX>, or
          subtree-neighborings).
          Optional: A gene tree based on the multiple alignment 
          A and the query 
          Q annotated with orthology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> confidence values for the query 
          Q .
          
            Procedure: 
          
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Query sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX> is aligned to the existing
          alignment 
          A (using hmmalign from the HMMER
          package and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> profile HMM 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ).
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The alignment is bootstrap
          resampled 
          x times (usually, 
          x = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>).
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Maximum likelihood pairwise
          distance matrices are calculated for each of the 
          x multiple alignments using a model
          of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitution</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLOSUM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayhoff PAM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ).
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. An unrooted phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is
          inferred for each of the 
          x multiple alignments by neighbor
          joining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , resulting in 
          x gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is rooted
          by a modified version of our SDI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] that
          minimized the number of duplications postulated (this is
          discussed in more detail later).
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. For each of the 
          x rooted gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>: For each node
          it is inferred whether it represents a duplication or a
          speciation event by comparing the gene tree to a trusted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX>.
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. For each sequence

          Precalculation of pairwise distances for increased
          time efficiency
          The most time consuming step in the procedure
          described above is the calculation of pairwise distances.
          [The time complexity is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">xLN 2</ENAMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> being the number of sequences, 
          L being their length, and 
          x being the number of bootstrap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resamples</ENAMEX>. On an average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> processor the wall clock
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrapped datasets of a typical Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple alignment</ENAMEX> is in the range of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.]
          Since the query sequence is aligned to stable Pfam
          alignments, it is possible to precalculate the pairwise
          distances for each alignment and store the results. Then,
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> is being used to analyze a query sequence, only
          the distances of the query to each sequence in the Pfam
          alignment have to be calculated. This step becomes thus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xLN</ENAMEX> ) instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">xLN 2</ENAMEX>).
          To do this correctly, the aligned query sequence has
          to be bootstrap resampled in exactly the same way as was
          used for precalculating the pairwise distances of the
          Pfam alignment. For this purpose, bootstrap positions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> which aligned columns from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignment were
          chosen in a particular bootstrap sample) are saved to a
          file. With this file it is possible to bootstrap the new
          alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam alignment</NUMEX> plus query
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence</ENAMEX>) in precisely the same manner, so the NxN
          precalculated distances are valid for the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)x(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance matrix</ENAMEX>. The alignment method must also guarantee
          that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Pfam multiple alignment</ENAMEX> remains
          unchanged when the query sequence is aligned to it. This
          requires specially prepared Pfam full alignments and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profile HMMs</ENAMEX> that are created with the HMMER software as
          follows:

          Rooting of gene trees
          The concept of speciation and duplication is only
          meaningful on rooted gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> joining
          algorithm infers unrooted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. We use a simple
          parsimony criterion for rooting. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are rooted on
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-3</ENAMEX> differently rooted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for a
          gene tree of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> sequences. For each of these, the
          number of inferred duplications is determined. From the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with a minimal number of duplications (if there is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with the shortest total height is
          chosen as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rooted tree</ENAMEX>. Empirical studies on gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX> Pfam alignments show that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60%</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> rooted in such a way have their root in the same
          position that direct midpoint rooting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] would place
          it.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Naively</ENAMEX> performing a full duplication/speciation

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-3</ENAMEX> differently rooted trees
          results in a overall time complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N 2</ENAMEX>) or worse, but this can be
          avoided. For the purpose of the following discussion it
          is assumed that our SDI algorithm for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">speciation/duplication</ENAMEX> inference is employed, but the
          idea applies to all algorithms based on a mapping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">function M</ENAMEX> defined as follows [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] :
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Definition 4</ENAMEX>. Let 
          G be the set of nodes in a rooted
          binary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and 
          S the set of nodes in a rooted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">binary species tree</ENAMEX>. For any node 
          g ∈ 
          G , let γ ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) be the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in which
          occur the extant genes descendant from 
          g . For any node 
          s ∈ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> , let σ ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) be the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the
          external nodes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> . For any 
          g ∈ 
          G , let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) ∈ 
          S be the smallest (lowest) node in 
          S satisfying γ ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">⊆ σ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> )).
          Duplications are then defined using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) as follows:
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Definition 5</ENAMEX>. Let 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          g 
          2 be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> nodes of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> node 
          g of a rooted binary gene tree 
          G . Node 
          g is a duplication if and only if
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>( 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ).
          The main task of most algorithms for duplication
          inference is the calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> has been
          calculated for any rooted gene tree 
          G it is possible to explore
          different root placements without having to recalculate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          for every node of 
          G . As long as the root is moved
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> node at the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> has to be recalculated only for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nodes: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> node which was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 1 (if the new
          root is placed on a branch originating from child <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of
          the previous root) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 2 (otherwise) of the previous
          root, as well as for the new root itself. Hence, two
          postorder traversal steps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 1 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the old root,
          then the new root) in the SDI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> are all that is
          needed. The new sum of duplications is determined by
          keeping track of the change in duplication/speciation
          status in the two recalculated nodes as well as in the
          previous root. Performing this over the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> tree
          (some nodes will be visited twice) it is possible to
          explore all possible root placements and calculate the
          resulting duplications in practically linear time. The
          pseudocode algorithm is as follows:

          Duplication inference requires a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tree. For
          this purpose, a single completely binary master species

        Implementation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> is implemented in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> of several
        software programs as follows. Alignment of the query

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rooting</ENAMEX> and duplication inference are accomplished by
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">SDIunrooted</ENAMEX>" - a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> implementation of our SDI algorithm
        which incorporates various methods for rooting (see above).
        The actual counting of orthologs is performed by methods of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> class "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>". These programs, with the exception of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMMER</ENAMEX>, are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FORESTER</ENAMEX> package and are available

        In order to run <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> locally, the following packages and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> need to be present: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMMER</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> database [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrEMBL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> is also available as an analysis webserver at

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten 1.26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHz Pentium III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processors</ENAMEX> are being used).
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Precalculation of pairwise distances
          Pairwise distances to be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analyses were
          calculated using the "full" alignments (as opposed to the
          smaller curated "seed" alignments) from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam 6.6</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001, 3071</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ). Sequences from species not
          present in the master species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> were removed from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX>. For computational efficiency reasons,
          alignments that still contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 600</NUMEX> sequences
          were further pruned; sequences not originating from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> were discarded, and sequences from certain
          mammals were excluded (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, rabbit, hamsters, goat, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX> except human), since mammals are likely to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversampled</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. For some extremely
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [immunoglobulin domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00047</NUMEX>), protein
          kinase domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00069</NUMEX>), collagen triple helix repeat
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF01391</NUMEX>), and rhodopsin-type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transmembrane</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00001</NUMEX>)], all mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequences</ENAMEX> except those from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> were excluded.
          Alignments of average length <30 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><40</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> finger domains) or with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><6</NUMEX> sequences
          were not analyzed, because of lack of phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. For all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, pairwise distances for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrap samples were prepared. Following the above
          rules, pairwise distances were precalculated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2384</TIMEX>
          alignments from a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3071</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam 6.6</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
          alignments were too short and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">612</NUMEX> alignments contained
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the master
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Phylogenomic analyses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> thalianaand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          elegansproteomes
          In order to get an estimate of the effectiveness of
          this implementation of automated phylogenomics, we used
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> procedure to analyze the 
          A. thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proteomes</ENAMEX>.
          The input for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> consists of a query <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence
          together with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignment for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family that
          the query belongs to. Before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> could be applied we
          therefore had to determine the matching domains for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the 
          A. thaliana and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans proteomes. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          composed of different domains, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analysis is
          performed for each domain individually.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> were:
          ATH1.pep<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.03202001</NUMEX>, a flatfile database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,579</NUMEX> 
          A. thaliana amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences
          (hypothetical, predicted and experimentally verified)
          that have been identified as part of the Arabidopsis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Initiative</ENAMEX> (AGI)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/info/agi.</ENAMEX>html, and wormpep <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>,
          a flatfile database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,730</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanger</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uk/Projects</ENAMEX>/C<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">_elegans/wormpep/.</ENAMEX>
          The program hmmpfam (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) from the HMMER
          package was used to search each protein sequence in
          ATH1.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pep.03202001</ENAMEX> and wormpep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam 6.6</NUMEX>. Only
          domains with a score above the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> gathering
          cutoff were reported ("cut_ga" option) in order to
          include only confident domain assignments.
          The sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> assigned to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,579</NUMEX> 
          A. thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,847</NUMEX> (counting multiple copies of the same domain in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as one). 12,431 sequences matched one domain
          (containing possibly multiple copies of this one domain).
          1,982 sequences matched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different domains (containing
          possibly multiple copies of both). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453</NUMEX> sequences matched
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more different domains (containing possibly
          multiple copies of each). Therefore, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,866</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) sequences from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATH1</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pep.03202001</ENAMEX> could be assigned
          to one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          Similarly, a sum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,314</NUMEX> domains was assigned to the
          19,769 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. 7,698
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> matched one domain, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,632</NUMEX> matched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          domains, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">388</ENAMEX> matched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or more</NUMEX> different domains.
          Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,718</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>) sequences from wormpep <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> could be
          assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> was then used to analyze each protein sequence
          matching one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The results from
          these analyses can be found at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wustl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/eddy/forester/rio_analyses/.</ENAMEX>
          The approximate time requirement was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between two</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX>, performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentium III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">800</ENAMEX> Mhz
          processors.
        
        
          How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> can be analyzed with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>?
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question we asked was simply how many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> can be analyzed with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>. For an overview, see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. From the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,847</NUMEX> 
          A. thaliana domain sequences
          matching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,905</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>) could be analyzed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> using the precalculated distances. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2859</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>)
          domain sequences were not analyzed because the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignments were either too short or
          did not contain enough sequences (as described above). 83
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>) domain sequences were not analyzed because the
          E-value for the match to their profile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMM</ENAMEX> was below the
          threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. This represents a second filtering
          step for preventing analyzing false domain assignments
          (besides only analyzing domain sequences which score
          above the gathering cutoff in the domain analysis). (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>
          performs a preprocessing step before aligning the query
          sequence to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignment, in which the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hmmsearch</ENAMEX> is used to trim the query sequence by searching
          it with the appropriate profile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMM</ENAMEX>. If the resulting
          E-value was below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> no analysis was performed.)
          Multiple copies of the same domain in certain sequences
          result in a sum of individual analyses larger then the
          number of analyzed domain sequences. In case of 
          A. thaliana this number was
          17,940.
          Correspondingly, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,314</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans domain sequences
          matching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,287</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>) could be analyzed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> using the precalculated distances. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">901</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>)
          domain sequences were not analyzed because the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignments were either too short or
          did not contain enough sequences. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX>) domain
          sequences were not analyzed because the E-value for the
          match to their profile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMM</ENAMEX> was below the threshold of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. In addition, we did not analyze the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans sequences matching the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immunoglobulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00047</NUMEX>), because we considered
          the phylogenetic signal in this alignment to be
          questionable. Furthermore, most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> sequences
          contain multiple copies of the immunoglobulin domain (for
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CE08028</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> immunoglobulin domains) and
          we therefore worried that the results from this family
          might skew our overall results. The sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analyses
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,740</NUMEX>.
          Thus, a little less than half of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteome</ENAMEX> can be
          analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>. The most important factor is whether a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> has a match to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.

          In order to test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> performs well on an
          "easy" case, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> was used to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lactate</ENAMEX>/malate
          dehydrogenase family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> both in 
          A. thaliana and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-Lactate</ENAMEX> and malate
          dehydrogenases are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family
          (represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pfam</ENAMEX> as ldh for the NAD-binding domain
          and ldh_C for the alpha/beta <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain), yet they
          catalyze different reactions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-lactate dehydrogenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>

          instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> + [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> domain
          analysis described above, the 
          A. thaliana proteome contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lactate/malate</ENAMEX> dehydrogenase family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, whereas the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans proteome contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
          (In addition, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans also contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> lactate/malate dehydrogenase
          family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , ldh_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>, which are not discussed here.) The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> output for the 
          A. thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein F12M16</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          analyzed against the ldh domain alignment is shown as an
          example in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The results are summarized in Tables
          2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Complete <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> output files (as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tree</ENAMEX> files) are avaliable, herefor 
          A. thaliana and at herefor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>elegans . In all cases,
          distinction between malate dehydrogenase (NAD) and
          lactate dehydrogenase is unquestionable and in accordance
          with existing annotations and BLAST results irrespective
          which domain (ldh or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ldh_C</NUMEX>) was used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analysis
          (which implies that no domain swapping occurred over long
          evolutionary times). Furthermore, the same results are
          achieved whether only the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequence (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with
          the highest orthology value, shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>) or
          the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sequences are used to transfer annotation
          from. The only likely NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase
          is the 
          A. thaliana sequence MCK7_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. For
          some query sequences, the top orthology values are low.
          Yet, all subtree-neighborings above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> exhibit consensus
          at distinguishing between malate and lactate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>. In contrast, a finer distinction (e.g.
          between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic malate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>) proves more problematic. While there is no
          case of actual conflict between the existing annotation
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> results, in many cases there is no compelling
          evidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> results to confirm the finer
          distinctions in the existing annotations. Obviously, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> is limited by the given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> and by the number (or even presence) of
          sequences for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub</ENAMEX>(sub)<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Sequences with no orthologs in the current
          databases
          Next, we determined the distribution of the top
          orthology bootstrap values. The sequence with the top
          orthology bootstrap value is the one that is most likely
          to be the true ortholog of the query. If the top
          orthology bootstrap value is low, then the query sequence
          is likely to have no ortholog in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignment.
          These results are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. For example, for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2252</TIMEX> 
          A. thaliana query sequences, at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sequence was orthologous in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 95</NUMEX> out of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> resampled <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. In contrast, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">930</NUMEX> 
          A. thaliana query sequences, no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was orthologous in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          bootstrapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. For query sequences with more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of the same domain, each copy had to meet the
          conditions individually in order for the whole query
          sequence being counted to be below or above the
          threshold.
          We do not think it is possible at this stage to
          determine reliable threshold values for "true orthologs"
          or "absence of orthologs". Such thresholds are very
          likely to be different for different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> vary in the phylogenetic signal their alignment
          contains. Some sequences that are very likely to be true

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orthologs</ENAMEX> nonetheless exhibit marginal orthology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values (in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> or even lower).
          We focused on sequences that appeared to have no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> bootstrap), since these would be cases
          where a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analysis might be most able to correct overly
          specific annotations that might be transferred based
          solely on sequence similarity (as illustrated in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An example for this is the 
          A. thaliana sequence F28P22_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>.
          (Files related to this analysis are avaliable, here.)
          This sequence is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-binding dehydrogenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adh_zinc</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PF00107</TIMEX>). F28P22_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> has been annotated in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cinnamaldehyde</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX> (but it can also act on coniferyl

          flavonoid, stilbene and lignin biosynthesis pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> analysis, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F28P22</TIMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> has no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8for</NUMEX> the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9for</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> output). Furthermore its
          subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>, cinnamyl-alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NADP-dependent alcohol</ENAMEX> dehydrogenases
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1.2</NUMEX>), exhibit only partial annotation agreement
          (namely that of some type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP-dependent</ENAMEX> alcohol
          dehydrogenase, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1.2</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1.195</NUMEX>).
          Hence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F28P22</TIMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> is likely to be a (possibly novel) type
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1.1.2</NUMEX>), possibly a novel type of cinnamyl-alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>.
          One might expect that each query sequence that appears
          to have no orthologs is connected with scenario similar
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> described above for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F28P22</TIMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>. Yet, this is
          clearly not the case, for the following reasons: (i) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX> might not be followed by functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modification</ENAMEX> (many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are composed of
          sequences which have all the same function, at least at
          the resolution of the current annotation). (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) Some Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are composed solely of sequences originating
          from closely related (or the same) species (such as
          PF02362, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B3 DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain of higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>). For
          such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, query sequences from the same species
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> are expected to have low orthology values. In such
          cases the concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX> and ultra-paralogs
          is more useful than orthologs. (iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erroneous RIO</ENAMEX>
          results caused by an insufficient phylogenetic signal
          (due to short sequences, for example) can lead to low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthology</ENAMEX> values. For this reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> also outputs the
          average bootstrap value for the consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to give
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> a hint about the amount of phylogenetic signal
          in the alignment used.
        
        
          Inconsistency between orthology bootstrap values
          and sequence similarity
          We were next interested in the number of sequences in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proteomes for which the orthology bootstrap
          values do not correspond to sequence similarity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Such disagreements could be caused by the situation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. To determine these numbers, we
          used the following rules. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> thresholds for orthology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values were chosen: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> , the minimum for being an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ortholog</ENAMEX> (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> , the maximum for not being an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ortholog</ENAMEX> (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>). Furthermore, a maximal ratio 
          R for the distance of the query to
          non-orthologs to the distance of the query to orthologs
          was chosen (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>). In order for being counted as
          exhibiting disagreement between the orthology bootstrap
          values and sequence similarity a query sequence had to
          fulfill the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions: (i) it must have a
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ortholog with bootstrap orthology value above
          or equal to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> , and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) 
          all sequences in the alignment with
          bootstrap orthology values above 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> , must have distance ratios
          smaller or equal to 
          R for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> sequence with
          bootstrap orthology lower or equal to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> . Sequences from the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were ignored in this analysis (since they were
          the species of the query sequence or related to it): 
          A. thaliana proteome: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosidae</ENAMEX> ( 
          A. thaliana, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pisum</ENAMEX> sativum , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glycine max</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cucurbita maxima ,</ENAMEX> 
          Cucumis sativus , 
          Brassica campestris , 
          Brassica napus , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Citrus unshiu</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Citrus sinensis</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Theobroma cacao ,</ENAMEX> 
          Gossypium hirsutum ); 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans proteome: nematodes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , 
          Caenorhabditis briggsae , 
          Haemonchus contortus , 
          Ascaris suum ).
          Manual inspection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> output leads to the
          following, somewhat unexpected, conclusion. In many cases
          a discrepancy between orthology bootstrap values and
          sequence similarity is caused by orthologs in only
          phylogenetically distant (relatively to the query
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence</ENAMEX>) species. This can lead to errors if functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> is blindly transferred from these orthologs to
          the query. As an example of this, the results of
          analyzing the 
          A. thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-methyltransferase
          F16P17_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> are shown in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10and 11</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complete</ENAMEX> files
          are at here.) Even though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F16P17</TIMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> sequence is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> to the bacterial hydroxyneurosporene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methyltransferases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1.1</NUMEX>.-) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] it would be
          dangerous to annotate it as such. A more reasonable
          annotation for this query would be to annotate it based
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX> and hence call it a plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-methyltransferase. An indication of this problem
          (besides a discrepancy between orthology bootstrap values
          and sequence similarity) is the meeting of the following
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conditions: A query sequence has (i) likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) likely subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> than the query itself, yet (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) there is no
          significant overlap between the orthologs and the
          subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>.
          We were unable to find convincing examples in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          A. thaliana proteomes where wrong
          sequence similarity based annotations might be caused by
          unequal rates of evolution (as illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This is not to say that such cases do not exist in those
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proteomes, but they are likely to be quite rare.
          Similarly to the issues described in the previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, the detection of such examples is complicated by
          the fact that for many cases in which a discrepancy
          between orthology bootstrap values and sequence
          similarity exists, all sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignment
          appear to have to same function, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
          lineage specific, or the annotations are too
          poor/confusing to make any kind of inference.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> is a procedure for automated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phylogenomics.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>
        procedure appears to be particularly useful for the
        detection of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of novel protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX>. Sequence similarity based methods can be
        misleading in these cases since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every query</TIMEX> is always "most
        similar to something", whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> can detect the absence
        of orthologs.
        Storm, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sonnhammer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have recently
        developed similar ideas and procedures in a program called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORTHOSTRAPPER</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] . One distinction between the two
        approaches is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORTHOSTRAPPER</ENAMEX>'s orthology determination
        procedure does not employ a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tree for duplication
        inference; it uses a heuristic based on sequence similarity
        rather than a formally correct phylogenetic means of
        inferring orthology. Another distinction is that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORTHOSTRAPPER</ENAMEX> uses uncorrected observed mismatches as a
        sequence distance measure, rather than estimating
        evolutionary distances. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> brings more of the
        power of known phylogenetic inference algorithms to bear on
        the problem of proteomic annotation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super-orthology</ENAMEX> is a very stringent criterion. If a
        query sequence is likely to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-orthologs</ENAMEX>, they
        represent an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to transfer functional
        annotation from. In contrast, the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">super-orthologs</ENAMEX> does not imply that a function for a query
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> cannot be inferred (in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteomes</ENAMEX> analyzed
        in this work, most sequences appear to have no
        super-orthologs in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam 6.6</NUMEX>).
        Ultra-paralogs are sequences in the same species as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> and are likely to be the result of recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX> and therefore might not have yet undergone
        much functional divergence. Operationally, splice variants
        can also be thought of as ultra-paralogs (at least as long
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> are considered).
        Subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uses: (i) If the
        subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of the query sequence exhibit (partial)
        agreement in their functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX>, the elements in
        which they agree might be used to infer a (partial)
        function for the query. This is useful for query sequences
        that are appear to have no orthologs in the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) For query sequences that do have orthologs,
        absence of overlap between the sequences considered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> and those which appear to be subtree-neighbors
        raises a red flag, indicating that the orthologs are in
        phylogenetically distant species relative to the query.
        Transferring annotation from such orthologs is risky. In
        this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX> are a more reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to
        transfer annotation from.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO outputs</ENAMEX> warnings if the distance of the query
        sequence to other sequences is unusually short or long,
        relative to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> lengths on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The
        usefulness of this was not investigated in this work.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX> procedure based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> alignments analyzes each
        protein domain individually since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> is protein family
        database based on individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respects</ENAMEX>, it would be preferable to analyze whole protein
        sequences, but well curated databases of complete protein
        alignments are not available (to our knowledge). However,
        domain-by-domain analysis is not necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disadvantageous</ENAMEX>. Due to domain shuffling many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, composed of domains with different
        evolutionary histories [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] . For such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> it
        makes much sense to analyze each domain individually.
        Furthermore, mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from sufficiently distant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> might be impossible to be aligned over more than
        one domain at the time, since they are unlikely to exhibit
        the same domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The same is true for multiple
        copies of the same domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>: Each of them is
        analyzed individually (such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> often differ in their
        number of domain copies and could therefore not be aligned
        from end to end for the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>).
        In general, the concept of "annotation consensus" is
        very important in this work (for example consensus between
        subtree-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, or between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtree-neighbors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX>). We have employed this notion loosely. A useful
        future extension would be to incorporate automated
        annotation consensus detection into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RIO</ENAMEX>. This would include
        annotation of internal nodes of a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with a
        "biological function". Automated consensus detection is
        trivial for a highly formalized notation system, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        numbers (the consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1.3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1.23</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1.1</NUMEX>, a oxidoreductase acting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CH</ENAMEX>-OH <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acceptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ). Obviously, it is
        much more difficult to analyze natural language annotations
        in the same manner. Perhaps this could be accomplished by
        utilizing the set of structured vocabularies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
