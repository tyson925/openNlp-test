        Transcription initiation is one of the most important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> points in regulating gene expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
        Recent observations have emphasized the importance of the
        core promoter, a region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>)
        flanking the transcription start site (TSS), in regulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> serves as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> site for the basal transcription apparatus,
        which comprises the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multisubunit RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and
        several auxiliary factors. Core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> show specificity
        both in their interactions with enhancers and with sets of
        general transcription factors that control distinct subsets
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Although there are no known DNA sequence motifs
        that are shared by all core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, a number of motifs
        have been identified that are present in a substantial
        fraction. The most familiar of these motifs is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX>, which has been reported to be part of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX> of core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        Prediction and analysis of core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> have been
        active areas of research in computational biology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>],
        with several recent publications on prediction of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, prediction of
        invertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> has received much less attention and
        has focused almost exclusively on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reese</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] described
        the application of time-delay neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and in our
        previous work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] we used a combination of a generalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hidden Markov</ENAMEX> model for sequence features and Gaussian
        distributions for the predicted structural features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Structural features were also examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levitsky</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katokhin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], but they did not present results for
        promoter prediction in genomic sequences.
        As with computational methods for predicting the
        intron-exon structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], the computational
        prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> has been greatly aided by cDNA
        sequence information. However, promoter prediction is
        complicated by the fact that most cDNA clones do not extend
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>. Recent advances in cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> construction
        methods that utilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-cap structure of mRNAs have
        allowed the generation of so-called 'cap-trapped' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        with an increased percentage of full-length cDNAs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> have been used to map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in
        vertebrates by aligning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-end sequences of individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> to genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. However, it is estimated
        that even in the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-80%</NUMEX> of cDNAs extend
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 19</TIMEX>], making it unreliable to base
        conclusions on individual cDNA alignments.
        We describe here a more cautious approach for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifying TSSs</ENAMEX> that requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the
        alignments of multiple, independent cap-selected cDNAs to
        lie in close proximity. We then examine the regions
        flanking these putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>, the putative core promoter
        regions, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved DNA</ENAMEX> sequence motifs. We also use
        this new set of putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> to retrain and significantly
        improve our previously described probabilistic promoter
        prediction method. Finally, we report the results of
        promoter prediction on whole 
        Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes,
        and discuss the different challenges of computational
        promoter recognition in invertebrate and vertebrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.

          Selection of expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) clusters
          to determine transcription start sites
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stapleton</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] report the results of
          aligning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237,471</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequences</TIMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115,169</NUMEX>
          obtained from cap-trapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, on the annotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome. They
          examined these alignments for alternative splice forms
          and grouped them into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,744</NUMEX> clusters with consistent
          splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, overlapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,644</NUMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-encoding
          genes. We applied the following set of criteria to select
          those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clusters most likely to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>.
          Clusters were required to either overlap a known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene or have evidence of splicing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three most 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in the cluster had to be derived
          from a cap-trapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. In some cases, disjoint
          clusters overlap the annotation of a single gene; here,
          we only considered the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">5</ENAMEX>' cluster. We required the
          distance to the next upstream cluster to be greater than
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 kb.</TIMEX> This requirement, together with the selection of
          only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the most 5</TIMEX>' cluster, leads to the selection of only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> start site per gene. By doing so, we minimize the
          erroneous inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> which are not full-length,
          but also exclude alternative start sites or start sites
          of genes with overlapping transcript. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> derived from full-length cDNAs are expected to
          lie in a narrow window at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>, we required that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> fall within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 11-bp</TIMEX>
          window of genomic sequence, and that the number of ESTs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">whose 5</ENAMEX>' ends fall within this window comprise at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in the cluster. With a single <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> we
          cannot be sure to have reached the true start site, even
          if it was generated by a method selecting for the cap
          site of the mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 19</TIMEX>]; with a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> within
          a small range, we can be more confident that we have
          defined the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>. By requiring selected clusters to
          have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> we are, however, introducing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> against genes with low expression levels. The
          requirement that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in a cluster
          terminate within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-bp window was introduced because,
          for large <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clusters, a simple numerical requirement is
          insufficiently stringent.
          We identified a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX> clusters, representing
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 14%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotated genes</ENAMEX>, which met all of the above
          criteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> how the numbers of selected
          clusters varies when we change a single parameter
          specified in the requirement for distance to next
          upstream cluster and the requirement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> fall in a specified window of
          sequence to a higher or lower value, leaving the other
          selection requirements constant. Not surprisingly, the
          most sensitive criterion by far is the window size. A
          large number of clusters show slightly different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' ends,
          which was also observed by other large-scale full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> projects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. At the moment, it is an open
          question how much of this variation is a result of
          incomplete extension to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end during library
          construction or an indication of a larger than expected
          variation in the transcription initiation process. The
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">5</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> of each selected cluster, along with its
          corresponding genomic location, is presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> in the additional data files
          available (see Additional data files).
          We defined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the most 5</TIMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> in each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX> clusters as the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> and refer to this as
          position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> in the analyses reported below. We extracted
          the genomic sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 bp</NUMEX> upstream to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> bp
          downstream of each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> as a set of putative
          proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions to compare with previous
          collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, to identify possible core
          promoter motifs, and to use as training set for
          computational promoter prediction. To study the motifs in
          core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> with more sensitivity, we also carried out
          analyses on subsequences from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+40</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Comparison with previous collections of core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">promoters</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> small collections of curated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila TSSs</ENAMEX> have been assembled
          previously on the basis of information carefully
          extracted from the literature. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Promoter Database</ENAMEX> (DPD)
          was the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSSs</ENAMEX> used to train earlier
          computational promoter finding systems such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNPP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. This DPD was assembled by combining
          
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eukaryotic Promoter Database release 63</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], and a set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> extracted according to similar criteria [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set was the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Core Promoter Database</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> start sites.
          To assess the quality of our inferred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>, we aligned
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,941 300 bp</NUMEX> sequences against sequences flanking the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX> using BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The derivation
          of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> set, which corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just over 14%</NUMEX> of all
          
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, did not depend on
          the scientific literature and thus we expect it to be
          largely non-overlapping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX> and CPD sets. It was
          therefore not surprising that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX> core promoter
          regions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 44</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>) could be aligned to
          those in our set. The positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> of
          these alignments differed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 10 bp</TIMEX> and are
          considered identical for our purposes; in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cases, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX> entries lie <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 10 bp</NUMEX> upstream, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>
          cases, a newly derived putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> core
          promoter regions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) belonging to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be aligned successfully; in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          cases, the difference was again smaller than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 bp</TIMEX>, in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cases, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX> entry was more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>', in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases a
          newly derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>. This simple assessment suggests that
          our new set of putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> is of similar accuracy to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX>. However, our set is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times larger,
          containing the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> for one in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented sequence motifs
          in core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          Core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are known to contain binding sites for
          proteins important for transcription initiation, and our
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis of the sequence content of our set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX> core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> was to assess the representation of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> well-established core promoter sequence motifs, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">initiator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. We used the CPD
          consensus strings for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Inr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G/T</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>(C/T) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATAAA</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], permitting
          up to one mismatch. A search with these consensus strings
          in random sequences of equal length would result in a
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.3%</NUMEX> for the initiator and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.6%</NUMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67.3%</NUMEX> have a match to the
          Inr consensus in the region from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10 to +10 and 42.4%</NUMEX>
          have a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> in the region from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-45</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15</NUMEX>. We
          observed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.8%</NUMEX> of our core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> had a match to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> consensus in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> interval, an almost
          identical fraction as observed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX>. However, we
          observed a frequency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> consensus of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.3%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the frequency observed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPD</ENAMEX>; extending the region over which we allowed matches
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only</TIMEX> increased the frequency to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.9%</NUMEX>.
          We next looked for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented motifs using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> system to analyze the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+40</NUMEX> on the leading strand ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] and see Materials
          and methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> uses the iterative
          expectation-maximization algorithm to identify conserved
          ungapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> in a set of query sequences, and delivers
          weight matrix models of the found non-overlapping motifs.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most statistically significant motifs found by
          this method are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and their location
          distributions within the sequences that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> used in its
          alignments are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Well-known motifs such
          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> are readily found (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> most significant motifs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). These motifs
          are known to have largely fixed locations relative to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>, and the tight distribution in the locations of the
          motifs we observe (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) implies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in our
          core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> set have been accurately mapped. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Motif 9</ENAMEX>
          matches the previously derived downstream promoter
          element (DPE) consensus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A/G</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>(A/T)(C/T)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX>, but Figure
          1suggests a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, distinct, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPE</ENAMEX> (motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
          From the location distribution it is apparent that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">motif 1</ENAMEX> is preferentially found close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>,
          although not as tightly localized as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> motif. Motif
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which shows a broad spatial distribution within the
          core promoter regions, corresponds to the target of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>-related-element binding factor (DREF). At
          the same time our study was being carried out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DREF</ENAMEX> was
          interestingly found to be part of a complex with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> TBP-related factor (TRF)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. TRF2 replaces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX>-box-binding element TBP
          in a distinct subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, and our data suggest
          that it is used in a larger fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> than
          previously thought.
          Because different algorithms for detecting
          overrepresented motifs have different properties (see
          Materials and methods), we compared the motifs identified
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>] with those
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>. Gibbs sampling is non-deterministic
          and generally delivers different results each time it is
          run; therefore, the motifs that are most significant are
          those that are reported multiple times with high
          likelihood scores. We performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> iterations of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>; each iteration was stopped after a maximum of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> motifs were reported. We sorted the resulting 986
          motifs by their log-likelihood score (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]), which
          ranged from negative infinity (the logarithm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,353</NUMEX>. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">354</NUMEX> motifs with scores higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>,
          we observed no motifs that were unrelated to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> most
          significant motifs found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Instead,
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">354</NUMEX> motifs were comprised of several variants each
          of motifs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; the best variant of motif
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,353</NUMEX> and the best variant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>
          scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">742</NUMEX>. We still consider it likely that the three
          motifs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2that</ENAMEX> were not also identified by Gibbs
          sampling are biologically meaningful. For example, motif
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, is similar in both sequence and positional restriction
          to the well-established DPE motif.
          We were interested in determining which of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          motifs shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2tend</ENAMEX> to occur together in
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. We searched the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> with
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weight matrix models</ENAMEX>, using the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patser</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). We restricted
          the sequence range in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> base of the model
          must lie to count as a match as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15</NUMEX> for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-20</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">+10 to +25</TIMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPE</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+25</NUMEX> for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> models. Table
          3gives the percentage of hits for each separate motif, as
          well as the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> containing a specific
          motif that also contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the other motifs. Some
          previously known dependencies are apparent; for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DPE</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> very often contain an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> motif,
          but rarely any of the other motifs. Other obvious
          correlations are a tendency for motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to also contain motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and a tendency for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">motif 7</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to contain motif 2 (DRE).
          Conversely, motif 7 is rarely observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. There is also a large difference in the
          likelihood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPE</ENAMEX> and the DPE-like motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to occur
          in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Motif 1</ENAMEX> is the only
          other motif in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA, Inr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPE</ENAMEX> motifs
          to show a marked spatial preference within the core
          promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and tends to occur near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>. It is
          therefore worth noting that there is a bias against
          cooccurrence of motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they
          may have similar roles in distinct subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          Weight matrices for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> motifs are provided in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> of the additional data files.
          To determine whether any of the motifs were enriched
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> for genes associated with a specific
          function, process or cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>, we retrieved the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) terms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] associated with the group
          of genes whose core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> contained a particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>. Even though some differences can be seen, it is
          too early to say whether any are biologically
          significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DREF/</ENAMEX>TRF2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were reported to control
          genes involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and cell proliferation,
          but we see no such clear restriction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DREs</ENAMEX>. The most frequent GO terms associated
          with each motif are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> of the
          additional data files.
          In a final experiment, we ran MEME on both strands of
          the entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-bp core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> the
          consensus sequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most statistically
          significant motifs. Note that the initiator and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>
          are no longer identified, owing to the background model
          and the extended sequences, but that some of the other
          core motifs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2are</ENAMEX> still highly statistically
          significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Motif 2</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4may</ENAMEX> be related to the
          reverse complement of the GAGA box, which has been
          reported to occur in clusters of adjacent copies [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Using the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> set to retrain the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> TSS prediction tool
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> is a probabilistic promoter prediction
          system that identifies likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in large genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 32</TIMEX>]. To a certain extent, the performance
          of such probabilistic systems can be improved by
          increasing the size of the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> used to estimate
          the system parameters. The dataset we originally used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">train McPromoter</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 247</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>
          non-coding and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">711</NUMEX> coding sequences. We took advantage of
          our new large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> set to retrain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McPromoter</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and methods). We used a slightly smaller set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,841</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> sequences that eliminated instances of
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> set, along with a
          newly extracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of non-promoter
          sequences taken from 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,635</NUMEX> coding and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,755</NUMEX> non-coding sequences). The tests we describe below
          document a markedly improved performance. The largest
          part of the improvement was due to the increase in the
          size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> set. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-validation</ENAMEX> experiments in
          which only a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> was used suggest that
          additional sequences similar to those in the current set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,841</NUMEX> would not further improve the results
          significantly (data not shown). However, it is possible
          that assembling a more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed at low
          levels would improve performance. It might also be useful
          to make training sets consisting of subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          that share combinations of motifs and use a collection of
          McPromoter variants each trained on a different class of
          core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Evaluating the performance of the retrained
          McPromoter
          
            Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.9 Mb</ENAMEX> Adhregion
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5shows</ENAMEX> the results of the retrained system on
            the test set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Genome</ENAMEX> Annotation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment Project</ENAMEX>, which consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            annotated with the help of full-length cDNAs in the 
            Adh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. A prediction is
            counted as correct if it falls in the region between
            -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 and +50</NUMEX> of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end.
            By comparison with another predictor for 
            Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNPP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>],
            the retrained McPromoter system has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX> times fewer
            false positives, but some of this improvement simply
            results from the larger training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> and not from
            differences in the underlying algorithm. When
            McPromoter was trained on the same, smaller, dataset as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNPP</ENAMEX>, the reduction in false positives was only about
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>- to sixfold (data not shown; for details see [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>]). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> system output ranges from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 1</TIMEX>,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5gives</ENAMEX> the results for a number of thresholds
            between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>; additional predictions below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>
            are no longer distinguishable from randomly spaced
            predictions (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] for discussion). Consider, for
            example, the predictions obtained at a threshold of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> true positives were located within
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+/-50</ENAMEX> bases of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end, and the average
            distance of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> true positives was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. As the
            real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> is likely to be further upstream than the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">annotated 5</ENAMEX>' end, we believe this result indicates that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">McPromoter</ENAMEX> performs well in predicting the precise
            location of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            The complete genome: a case study of chromosome
            arm 2R
            The annotation of genomes is a process in flux as
            new data and analysis tools are continuously refined.
            We used the reannotated chromosome arm 2R [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] to
            evaluate our ability to predict promoter regions in a
            complete eukaryotic chromosome. Of the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSSs</ENAMEX> used for retraining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McPromoter</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">423</NUMEX> correspond to
            genes located on arm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,231</NUMEX> annotated genes
            on this chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have at least one
            transcript with an annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated region
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>) (that is, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> with length <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0</NUMEX>) and these
            genes produce a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,742</NUMEX> transcripts with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">annotated 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. While the average size of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' UTR
            is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 265</NUMEX> bp [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], the average genomic distance
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UTR</ENAMEX> start to the beginning of the annotated
            open reading frame (ORF) in chromosome arm 2R is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,444</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>; a more detailed distribution is depicted in Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. As evidence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, the annotators use the
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, but with less stringent criteria
            than we used to select for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>. Many 
            Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have large
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> and these introns may not be
            detected if the cDNA clone from which the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> is
            derived is not full length; this will lead to frequent
            placement of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> too close to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>.
            We therefore counted a hit as positive if it fell
            within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-1,000/</TIMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end, a region
            twice as large as for the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adh</ENAMEX> set. Because of the large
            number of genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end,
            which often lie closely together, we did not evaluate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> on the level of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>, but rather on
            the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; that is, if at least one prediction
            falls within the positive region of any of its
            annotated start sites, it is considered as positive
            hit. At threshold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,232</NUMEX> TSSs referring to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,176</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55.2%</NUMEX>) genes are correctly identified, with one
            additional prediction every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,663</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> across the
            whole chromosome. This is comparable to the performance
            on the 
            Adh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). We did
            not pre-filter for low-complexity regions, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>
            genes were left out of the test set because of missing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> information, so the real false-positive rate is
            most likely to be lower.
            Although it is desirable for a promoter recognition
            system to be as good as possible when used with no
            additional information on naked genomic sequence, tools
            are not used in isolation in a genome annotation
            project. For example, we used information about the
            position of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and considered only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hit
            upstream of the translation start codon of each gene,
            but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 5 kb</NUMEX> upstream of the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' UTR
            end. We therefore make at most one prediction per gene
            - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> if there is no hit above the predefined
            threshold within the scanned region. Leaving the
            threshold at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McPromoter</ENAMEX> predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,017</NUMEX>
            genes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.8%</NUMEX>) within the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1,000/</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> region, makes no
            prediction for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">392</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.4%</NUMEX>), and delivers
            predictions outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1,000/</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> with respect
            to the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">721</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.8%</NUMEX>).
            As more experimental data from mapping TSSs are
            obtained, it will be interesting to see if the
            percentage of successful prediction increases. One
            particularly promising approach will be to use the
            large amount of additional information we have from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. As described above, we applied very strict
            criteria for identifying the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,941</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSSs</ENAMEX> used in our
            training set. We have, however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one 5</TIMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> for
            an additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Looking for
            coincidences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> predicted by McPromoter
            and the genomic positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of these ESTs
            is likely to be a powerful approach. As an initial test
            of this idea, we ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McPromoter</ENAMEX> with a very low
            threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> on the whole genome, and retained all
            the hits as long as they were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 100 bp</NUMEX> apart.
            As above, no filtering for repeats and low-complexity
            regions was carried out. Because of the very low
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX>, we generated an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> predicted TSS
            every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> nucleotides in the genome. We found that
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,160</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> - of these
            predictions is on the appropriate strand and within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end. If these predictions are valid, we
            would expect them to be closer than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 bp to an EST</TIMEX>
            end. Indeed, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,160</NUMEX>
            predictions in fact lie within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 bp of an EST</TIMEX>, much
            higher than would be expected by chance, and in
            accordance with the results in the much smaller 
            Adh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> set. Even when we
            require co-localization within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 bp</TIMEX>, we still retain
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the predictions originally selected to be within
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 bp</TIMEX>. The next step is to optimize both the threshold
            we use for predicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX> and the window size we
            use for assessing their correlation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> ends.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we will still need to conduct experiments
            such as primer extension to distinguish real from
            false-positive predictions.
          
        
        
          A comparison with vertebrate promoter
          finding
          It is instructive to examine our results on the 
          Drosophila genome in the context of
          recent work on promoter finding in vertebrates. As a
          benchmark set, the 'known' genes of human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          are widely used, as it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> completely sequenced
          human chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The annotation of release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3</NUMEX> of
          May <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">339</NUMEX> known genes. We applied the first
          version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> trained on human data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], which
          uses only sequence features and a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain
          model for the whole promoter sequence. Along the
          guidelines of earlier evaluations, we counted a
          prediction as correct if it fell within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-2,000</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+500</NUMEX>
          bp relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the annotation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>], and
          retained only the best hit within a window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>
          bases. As a negative set, we used the sequences
          downstream of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+500</NUMEX> until the end of each gene annotation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6shows</ENAMEX> the results for different thresholds.
          Despite the large region where predictions count as
          correct, the average distance of true positive
          predictions is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 250 bp</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX> of these are
          located within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">± 100 bp</TIMEX>, making our results comparable to
          those reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For example, Scherf 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] report a sensitivity
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> on the set of known genes and specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          for the whole of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>. They do not attempt to
          predict the strand of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (and also do not
          predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> locations but rather promoter regions of an
          average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">555 bp</ENAMEX>); as our evaluation considers only the
          sense strand of the genes, the numbers are
          comparable.
          The good results obtained on human data with even a
          simple sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are apparently largely due to the
          strong correlation of vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> with CpG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of known genes on chromosome
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> are located within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, regions in the genome
          that are not depleted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CG</ENAMEX> dinucleotides and are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an open chromatin structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. At <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> of the true predictions by McPromoter
          are located within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, and the correlation gets
          stronger as the specificity increases. This was also
          reported for other, more recently developed
          promoter-finding systems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Therefore,
          promoter-finding methods based on sequence information
          successfully identify almost the exact same subset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX>, owing to the high correlation with the subset
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> located within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Vertebrate
          promoter recognition thus appears to be reaching its
          limit when the models use the proximal promoter sequence
          as the only information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
          In the only system so far with a significantly better
          performance and smaller correlation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands,
          promoter recognition is guided by a simultaneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. When we used the version
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> that includes analysis of the physical
          properties of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, as we do with 
          Drosophila , the true positives are
          much less correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>), and
          therefore constitute a broader subset of vertebrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, the false-positive rate
          increased roughly fivefold, and the predictions tend to
          be located farther away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms
          differ in that invertebrate genomes do not contain CpG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>, a feature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of vertebrate genes
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. This makes computational recognition of
          invertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, and those vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, more difficult.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we present a strategy for annotating core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in the complete 
        Drosophila genome by a two-step
        process of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> cluster selection and computational
        prediction. With the help of a larger training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>, we were
        able to significantly improve the performance of
        McPromoter, our computational TSS prediction tool. Probably
        for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in invertebrate promoter prediction, the
        results are sensitive and specific enough to guide
        verification by subsequent wet lab experiments such as
        primer extension.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis of motifs prevalent in core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
        revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-third</NUMEX> of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> have a consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the DRE motif that is part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> site for an alternative transcription
        initiation complex that utilizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRF2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] is more
        frequent than previously thought. One surprising result of
        our work is that there are relatively few recognizable
        binding sites for known general transcription factors in 
        Drosophila core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Our
        analysis did, however, reveal previously undescribed or
        underappreciated motifs, an encouraging sign that there are
        distinct features in 
        Drosophila core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> is accessible at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. The training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> are
        available from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX> website [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. McPromoter predictions are part of the analysis
        results in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Annotation Database Gadfly</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clustering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alignment</ENAMEX> and clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> on the complete 
          Drosophila sequence are described
          in detail in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Motif finding
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> system, version 3.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] to look
          for core promoter motifs using a motif width range of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-15 bp</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or one occurrence per sequence. That is,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MEME</ENAMEX> decides during the motif identification whether or
          not to include a sequence; the numbers of sequences that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEME</ENAMEX> used for the alignments are given in Tables 2and 4.
          We observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> is rather restrictive in deciding
          whether to use a particular sequence or not; thus, the
          number of sequences in any given motif alignment is
          rather small, and searching for binding sites as
          described below resulted in larger numbers of sequences
          with a particular motif. We used the standard background
          model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the single-nucleotide
          frequencies in the set. For the analysis of the extended
          sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-250</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+50</NUMEX>, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>-order Markov
          chain as background model, which should prevent the
          algorithm from reporting ubiquitous short repeat motifs.
          The background parameters were estimated on the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-250</NUMEX> to
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> sequences.
          We also applied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling algorithm for motif
          identification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Our data set was too large to be
          submitted to the available web-based sites. We therefore
          used an implementation adapted to DNA sequence analysis
          that we could install locally [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] to analyze sequences
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+40</NUMEX> in the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> used with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>. As with other implementations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling,
          this implementation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] does not automatically estimate
          the width of motifs, which we fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. Also,
          there is no equivalent of the 'zero or one occurrence per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>' statistics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX>; instead, we used a prior
          probability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.075</NUMEX> for motif occurrence. This property
          makes the identification of rarely occurring motifs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrinsically</ENAMEX> harder.
        
        
          Searching for binding sites
          To look for binding sites of the motifs, we used the
          weight matrices as computed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> with the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v3d</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. As the searched regions are rather
          small, we set a rather low threshold corresponding to a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-3</ENAMEX>; that is, once
          every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> nucleotides in a random sequence we can
          expect to see a score equal or better than the threshold,
          assuming that the sequence has the same base composition
          as our core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> set.
        
        
          Datasets
          To retrain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> system, we used the newly
          determined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSSs</ENAMEX>, and extracted <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 bp</NUMEX> upstream and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> bp
          downstream of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSS</ENAMEX> as training sequences. We
          constructed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set starting from these
          1,941 sequences similar to the guidelines of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eukaryotic Promoter Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]: Sequences are only
          included if they share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> identity in the core
          promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (in our case, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+40</NUMEX>) to each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in the growing set. This resulted in a data set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,864</NUMEX> sequences. We aligned this set to the 
          Adh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> that we use as test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> within the 
          Adh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were removed from that
          set.
          For non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX>, we started with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of genes compiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">comprised 416</ENAMEX> single-and multi-exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, we used the genes contained in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December, 2001</TIMEX>. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, we eliminated genes that
          showed evidence of alternative splicing. The remaining
          set was aligned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], and we retained all cDNA entries where the
          protein completely aligned with the cDNA, and the
          similarity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 90%</NUMEX> for 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> entries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' UTRs
          were truncated, and the remaining sequences were aligned
          to the genomic sequence using Sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], to map the
          exon-intron structure. This resulted in a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX>
          entries with hits to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> entries, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. These sequences
          were then added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the existing initial set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, provided that the similarity of the coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 80%</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> already in the set. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX> sequences were added in this way, resulting
          in a final set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">645 single</NUMEX>- and multi-exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Exons
          and introns of these genes were then divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-bp
          long non-overlapping stretches to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,635</NUMEX> coding
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,755 intronic sequences of 300 bp</NUMEX> each.
        
        
          Computational promoter prediction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPromoter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> consists of a generalized hidden
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> model of a promoter sequence, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpolated Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> submodels representing
          different segments of the promoter sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-250</NUMEX> to
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>: upstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>, spacer, initiator and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX>. It is augmented by a set of Gaussian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">densities</ENAMEX> describing profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> physicochemical
          properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. The likelihoods of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and profile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are finally combined in a
          neural network classifier, which is trained to output
          values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> for non-promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-validation</ENAMEX> tests of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> different
          properties such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA bendability</ENAMEX> and nucleosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">positioning</ENAMEX> (compiled in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]) showed that stacking
          energy delivered the best classification results for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and 
          Drosophila sequences when combined
          with the sequence probabilities. On our previous small 
          Drosophila dataset, a combination
          of all features by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX>-component analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, see
          for example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]) led to an improvement in
          classification; however, on the current larger dataset,
          no additional improvement is observed when using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>.
          We carried out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cross-validation</ENAMEX> experiments on
          the new dataset, setting aside <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> as a test set
          and taking the remaining four-fifths for training. The
          best average cross-correlation value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>) of promoter
          versus non-promoter classification was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.79</NUMEX>, with an
          equal recognition rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89.9%</NUMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> operating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics integral</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,575</NUMEX>.
          To localize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in genomic sequences, an input
          window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> bp is shifted along both sides of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and the neural network score as well as the
          position of the initiator segment is stored for each
          window. After smoothing the score graph along the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, the best local maximum within a certain range
          is reported if it exceeds a preset threshold on the
          score. A detailed description can be found in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Evaluation measures
          For classification into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>/non-promoter, we used
          the equal recognition rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERR</ENAMEX>) and the integral over
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> operating characteristics (ROC) as measures.
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curve gives the recognition rate (true positives)
          for preselected values of false positives, which was in
          our case <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 to 100%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> steps. Then, the trapezoid rule
          is used to compute the integral numerically. The highest
          achievable value is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 × 100</ENAMEX>, the perfect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> for all rates of false positives); a random
          classification results in a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERR</ENAMEX> gives the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> performance at the point where the rate of
          true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">positives</TIMEX> equals the rate of true negatives; the ROC
          integral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> the performance in a more global manner.
          We also give the correlation coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>), defined
          as:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> stands for true positives, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> for true negatives, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FP</ENAMEX> for false positives, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX> for false negatives; these
          numbers denote the absolute numbers of correctly and
          incorrectly classified sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> values should be
          considered with caution, as they depend on the relative
          size of the dataset for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and can therefore
          generally not be compared across different datasets.
