        Since human infection with 
        Cryptosporidium parvum was first
        documented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , this protozoan parasite has been
        recognized worldwide as a major cause of diarrheal disease
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In healthy, immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> parvum causes a self-limited
        diarrheal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> (cryptosporidiosis); however, in persons
        with severe immunosuppression, particularly those infected
        with the human immunodeficiency virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) and who have
        developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>), the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> can be prolonged, severe, and life-threatening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] . Currently there are no effective chemotherapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> against cryptosporidiosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . 
        Cryptosporidium oocysts are found in
        the feces of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX>, and wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . Humans acquire the infection through person-to-person
        or animal-to-person contact, ingestion of
        fecally-contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, or contact with
        fecally-contaminated environmental surfaces [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        Cryptosporidium oocysts have an
        ubiquitous geographic distribution and can be detected in
        most surface drinking water sources [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The oocysts are
        resistant to environmental degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , survive
        chlorination water treatment, and are too small (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 6</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microns</ENAMEX>) to be removed by conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> filters [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . Risk factors for acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> have been
        determined primarily in studies of community-wide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outbreaks</ENAMEX>, and drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> has been implicated as the
        source of these outbreaks [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Case-control studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have also been
        conducted during outbreaks [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 15</NUMEX> ] , but levels of
        endemic risk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> remain uncertain, even
        though there is great concern for diarrheal disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ]
        . Because defining the risk associated with drinking tap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is particularly important for counseling
        immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on reducing their risk of
        cryptosporidiosis, we conducted a case-control study among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> to test the hypothesis
        that the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption is associated
        with the development of endemic cryptosporidiosis.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study design
          We conducted a matched case-control study. Among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco AIDS Registry</ENAMEX> from
          May <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 through September 1998</TIMEX>, we compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
          developed cryptosporidiosis to those who did not. We
          evaluated the hypothesis that cryptosporidiosis among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would be associated with the pattern of tap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption after adjusting for potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounders</ENAMEX> in a multivariable conditional logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The study was not designed to assess
          whether point of use filtering, boiling, or other tap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> processing among tap water <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> was
          protective. Therefore, for this study, tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was
          defined as municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the faucet whether or not
          it was filtered, boiled or processed further.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Human Research</ENAMEX> and the Biosafety
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of the University of California at San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> approved this study protocol.
        
        
          Study subjects
          The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-defining diagnosis living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Public Health</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFDPH</ENAMEX>) maintains a reporting system on cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
          residing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> are regularly updated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte count and diagnosis of conditions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, such as cryptosporidiosis. The
          completeness of reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> has
          been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> overall: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> from private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          A case was defined as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> who was reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>-confirmed, positive stool
          test for 
          Cryptosporidium parvum from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 through September 1998</TIMEX>. Cases could have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> diagnosed as an initial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-defining
          opportunistic infection or as a subsequent opportunistic
          infection. A control was defined as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> who was reported with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> and did not have a
          laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. For
          cases and controls we collected information on date of
          birth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity, gender, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of the
          diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte
          counts recorded and the date of each test. For each case,
          we determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> +count closest to the date of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> diagnosis.
          Cases and controls were matched based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          criteria: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>), sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity, CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte count (+/- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> points) and date of CD4
          +count (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> of the case's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +count that was
          closest to the date of diagnosis), and date of case
          diagnosis. Controls who were participating in other
          studies conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> were not eligible for this study. In
          addition, we excluded eligible controls who had a history
          of psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or psychosis. Controls were tested
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">subclinical disease</ENAMEX> by testing stool for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> documented
          negative stool samples defined a potential control for
          this study. No potential controls were positive on stool
          testing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> controls were matched to each
          case.
          The primary health care providers of the cases and
          controls were asked for permission to solicit the
          participation of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this study. Cases and
          controls were initially contacted by phone at home
          between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 am and 8:00 pm.</TIMEX> If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calls were
          unsuccessful, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> written solicitations were sent.
          The questionnaire was administered by telephone in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English or Spanish</ENAMEX> after verbal consent was obtained.
          Controls were sent a package containing stool collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vials</ENAMEX> and instructions for collection and mailing of
          samples. Controls received a payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> after SFDPH
          received written consent. Cases received a payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX>
          for participation in this study.
        
        
          Exposure measurement
          The questionnaire was designed to assess the relative
          importance of several risk factors for cryptosporidiosis
          in the recent past. Cases were asked about water
          exposures in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-week</TIMEX> period before the onset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. Controls were asked about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> exposures in
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-week</TIMEX> period before the interview. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interviewer</ENAMEX> requested information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> were asked whether they
          always, sometimes, or never drank tap water inside and
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> (such as workplace or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>). They
          were asked to reply (yes or no) to the use of tap water
          for brushing teeth, washing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, consuming
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> made from tap water both inside
          and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> were asked the type of
          drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumed while traveling outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>, whether they used hot tubs, swam in lakes or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>, or had other recreational exposure in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> (for cases) or interview (for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>). Our primary exposure variable was the pattern
          of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption (always, sometimes, never)
          whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was processed further.
          We asked about the pattern of bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          consumption inside and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Responses to
          cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> with tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (yes, no) and
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unpasteurized milk</ENAMEX> (yes, no) were also
          obtained. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of cryptosporidiosis infection
          were assessed, such as potential exposure to fecal
          material from sexual behavior, diapers, patient care, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked about recent travel outside
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s municipal water system distributes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that is either filtered or unfiltered at the
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> distribution varies both
          geographically and temporally depending on the
          operational requirements of the water system.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX>' residential address was used to determine
          whether, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> prior to the case's <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residence</ENAMEX> received municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that was either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtered</ENAMEX>, mixed, or unfiltered. Addresses and interview
          dates were provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Public Utilities</ENAMEX>
          Commission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Quality Bureau</ENAMEX> to classify this
          exposure. This analysis was added after study completion
          and was not a primary hypothesis.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          For the sample size calculations we estimated that our
          study would have required <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">200</ENAMEX> cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> controls to
          detect an odds ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> I error of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power. However, because the number of cases
          occurring decreased dramatically we extended our study
          period to accrue more study subjects. At the end of the
          study we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> cases and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> matched controls.
          Bivariate analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> infection were performed for water
          exposure variables, fecal exposure variables, and other
          possible exposures using conditional logistic regression.
          The matched odds ratios (ORs) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (CIs) are reported.
          Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis were determined a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priori</ENAMEX>. Composite variables were developed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          major exposure routes (tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, fecal
          matter). For each we constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels of
          exposure: lowest, intermediate, and highest. For example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who answered "never" to drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tap water</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and also answered "never" to drinking tap water
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> were categorized as "lowest" exposure
          for the tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> composite variable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> who
          responded "always" to both questions were classified as
          "highest" exposure, and a mixed response resulted in an
          intermediate exposure classification. A similar composite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> was created from bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumed at home
          and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. A fecal exposure composite variable
          was created from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions: sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, and touching anything soiled with feces or
          helping someone with toileting. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> answered
          "yes" to having either exposure, they were classified as
          having been exposed to fecal material.
          A composite variable was created for recreational
          water exposure, i.e., exposure to pools, lakes, rivers,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>, or oceans. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> ingested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from
          any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or submerged their heads
          under the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, then they were classified as having been
          exposed to a recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that could have
          put them at risk for cryptosporidiosis.
          To examine the independent association between the
          pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and cryptosporidiosis
          infection, while adjusting for other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cryptosporidial</ENAMEX> infection, adjusted, matched odds ratios
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals were calculated using
          multivariable conditional logistic regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Population attributable fraction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> attributable fraction (PAF) is the
          theoretical proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> cases that would have
          been prevented had a specific exposure never occurred,
          assuming the exposure is causal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . We calculated
          the proportion of cryptosporidiosis cases theoretically
          attributable to various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> exposures from the results
          of the multivariable conditional logistic regression
          models using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> methods for case-control studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
          .
          All analyses were conducted in S-Plus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
          bivariate analysis where cells contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, unmatched,
          median-unbiased odds ratios and exact <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          intervals were calculated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>-p function as
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        During the study period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> cases from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> Registry
        were identified for possible inclusion in the study; of
        these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> moved out of jurisdiction, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was deceased
        at the time of contact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> were ineligible for the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>

        sample.
        Using pairwise matching criteria, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> eligible controls
        were identified from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS registry</ENAMEX>. From these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were not contacted because the primary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provider</ENAMEX> did not grant permission, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> moved out

        had a sufficient number of controls per case, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> refused. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> controls constituted
        the control sample.
        The demographic characteristics of the cases and
        controls are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The study population
        consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> cases, each matched by date of case

        The unadjusted, matched odds ratios for the occurrence
        of cryptosporidiosis according to exposure to water

        "never" drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tap water</ENAMEX> inside or outside the home
        (lowest exposure), cryptosporidiosis was associated with
        the intermediate exposure category of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption
        (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.59</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31.4</NUMEX>) and strongly associated with

        home accounted for most of this effect (sometimes category:

        reported always drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tap water</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        The unadjusted, matched odds ratios for the occurrence
        of cryptosporidiosis according to exposure to non-drinking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Neither sexual
        activity, sex with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, nor travel
        outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were associated with the
        development of cryptosporidiosis. Sex with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diarrhea</ENAMEX> had an elevated, but not statistically
        significant, measure of association with cryptosporidiosis
        (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.00</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.61</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.30</NUMEX>). Having touched anything
        soiled with feces or helping someone with toileting were
        not associated with cryptosporidiosis.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> multivariable conditional logistic regression models
        are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 1</ENAMEX> tested the hypothesis of
        whether the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption inside the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> were separately associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> after adjusting for potential exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fecal material</ENAMEX> (had sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> who had diarrhea,
        cared for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, or touched something soiled
        with feces from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>) and living in a
        residence supplied with filtered or unfiltered municipal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In this model the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption
        inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> was associated with cryptosporidiosis
        (sometimes category: OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.70</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.63</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36.3</NUMEX>, always

        pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption was strongly associated
        with cryptosporidiosis with a dose-response relationship
        (intermediate exposure: OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.92</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.9</NUMEX>,

        models, cryptosporidiosis was not associated with whether
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> was supplied with filtered or unfiltered
        municipal tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Assuming a causal relationship between tap water
        consumption and the development of cryptosporidiosis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>; that is, the proportion

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption could have been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 85%</NUMEX>. The PAF
        from other potential factors, such as exposure to feces or
        living at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> supplied with unfiltered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, was
        below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based case-control study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrolling</ENAMEX> incident cases of cryptosporidiosis to evaluate
        and detect a strong association between an increasing
        pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and the development of
        cryptosporidiosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
        Prior studies of cryptosporidiosis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not interview incident cases, and therefore,
        often did not have information on individual-level
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waterborne</ENAMEX> exposures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 23 24 25</ENAMEX> ] . We also detected a
        strong negative association between the pattern of always
        drinking bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at home and cryptosporidiosis. This
        can be explained by the finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who reported
        always drinking bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> rarely drank tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, this result suggests drinking bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
        may be a safer alternative to drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tap water</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is derived from several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> filter the water before
        distribution to city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . No waterborne
        outbreak of cryptosporidiosis has ever been detected. This
        study did not find an association between developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> and living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> that received
        filtered compared to unfiltered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, even after adjusting
        for the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        Although this result is consistent with a previous ecologic
        study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that filtering at the level of a
        municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> may not be successful in decreasing cases
        of cryptosporidiosis, this negative finding must be viewed
        with caution since our study was not specifically designed
        nor statistically powered to assess this exposure.
        Because this was an observational study, our results do
        not prove that tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was the source of cryptosporidial
        infection. However, the dose-response relationship between
        the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and cryptosporidiosis
        makes a causal relationship more likely. Nonetheless, it is
        possible that residual confounding due to measured or
        unmeasured factors may explain the results. However,
        statistical adjustment for known confounders did not weaken
        the association between the pattern of tap water
        consumption and cryptosporidiosis. The strength of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> would require that unknown or unmeasured
        confounders have very strong effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , which is
        unlikely given that adjustment for the likely confounders
        did not change our results.
        We also considered the possibility that our finding is
        due to bias from cases having differential recall of
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> exposures. However, during this period there
        was a general awareness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of tap water
        as a potential source of cryptosporidial infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        We believe this prior awareness would have influenced the
        recall of both cases and controls, thereby reducing any
        differential recall. Also, there does not appear to be
        differential recall with respect to sexual and other
        potential fecal exposures. Therefore, we believe that even
        if such a recall bias was operating, it would not account
        for the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> we detected.
        Other routes of fecal contamination were not associated
        with cryptosporidiosis in the bivariate and multivariable
        analyses. Sex with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> was moderately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> in the bivariate analysis (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.00</NUMEX>) but was not
        statistically significant. Because the incubation period
        between exposure to 
        Cryptosporidium oocysts and symptoms
        is not well understood in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, it is possible
        that contact with fecal material which occurred long before
        the incident diagnosis might be the source of these
        infections. In favor of this hypothesis is the observation
        that cryptosporidiosis is more common among gay and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bisexual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> than among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . Nonetheless, prior sexual practices are unlikely to
        be associated with current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption patterns [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The methods we used to calculate the attributable
        fractions depend on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assumptions: the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in the base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is sufficiently small so
        that the odds ratio provides a satisfactory estimate of the
        relative risk; and the cases in this study are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of all cases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, thus
        allowing us to calculate the proportion of cases in each
        stratum of exposure categories [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> risk of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> diagnosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during
        this study period was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] , sufficiently
        low so that the odds ratio approximates the relative risk.
        The study base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco AIDS</ENAMEX> registry,
        is representative of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        .
        There were several limitations to this study. First, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of cryptosporidiosis cases dropped
        dramatically during the study period resulting in a much
        smaller study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> than initially planned. The number
        of cryptosporidiosis cases decreased <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX> cases
        were reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 13</NUMEX> cases of
        cryptosporidiosis were recorded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS Registry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        . Because of the small study size, our ability to more
        precisely calculate matched adjusted odds ratios for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multivariable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were limited. However, for our primary
        hypothesis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the pattern of tap water
        consumption and cryptosporidiosis, the sample size was
        sufficient to detect the observed large and statistically
        significant dose-response relationship. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, cases were
        asked about potential exposures in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> prior to
        their illness onset, whereas controls (whose stools tested
        negative for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> ) were asked about
        potential exposures in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> prior to their
        interview. Because of the lag time between selecting a
        eligible control and interviewing them, an intercurrent
        illness could have caused them to lower or increase their
        tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> prior to their
        interview, thereby inflating or deflating the association
        the between the pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, when this study was designed the use of highly
        active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was uncommon (about
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) and this information was not collected on subjects;
        however, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 to 1999</TIMEX> the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> increased from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% to 60%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . Although cases and controls were matched on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T
        lymphocyte count, the exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> may have been a
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">confounder</ENAMEX> if this exposure was protective
        against cryptosporidiosis independent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +count and if
        HAART exposure was correlated with decreased tap water
        consumption. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we did not actually measure tap water
        consumption but rather we asked about the pattern of use
        (never, sometimes, always) in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> preceding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illness</ENAMEX> (cases) or interview (controls). This assumes that
        these pattern of use categories have the same meaning to
        cases and controls with respect to quantity of water
        consumed, which may not be the true.
        Finally, our matched case-control study was designed to
        assess the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-level effect of tap water exposure and not
        the effect of boiling or filtering (although this
        information was collected from subjects that answered "yes"
        to consuming tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>). To assess the effects of filtering
        or boiling would require a case-control analysis among only
        those that consumed tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>; this was not possible with
        the pairwise matching and small study size. Additionally,
        our study underestimates the association between the
        pattern of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and cryptosporidiosis
        because among those that consumed tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, some of them
        also filtered or boiled their tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> which would have
        mitigated the risk of tap water exposure. Among those that
        consumed tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at home sometimes or always (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47/49</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>]
        of cases and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">68/99</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>] of controls), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20/47</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) of cases
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32/68</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>) of controls filtered their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sometimes
        or always, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/47</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>) of cases and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10/68</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%%</NUMEX>) of
        controls boiled their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sometimes or always.
        In spite of its limitations, our study suggests that the
        relative risk of cryptosporidiosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from
        drinking tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is high (adjusted OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.6</NUMEX> for highest
        exposure category). A similar study conducted among
        immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the same geographic region found
        that cryptosporidiosis was only associated with foreign
        travel but not tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discordance</ENAMEX> in results supports the observation that host
        susceptibility, i.e., immune status, is the primary
        determinant of developing cryptosporidiosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Because the relative importance of the risk
        factors for cryptosporidiosis is different among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocompetent</ENAMEX> and immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX>, public health prevention messages to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> must be tailored accordingly.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The public health significance of our study, i.e. a
        population attributable fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>, is noteworthy,
        especially since there are no effective chemotherapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> against cryptosporidiosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The only effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to combat cryptosporidiosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is
        treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] because this raises CD4 +T
        lymphocyte count, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +counts over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> cells/ml are better able to resist cryptosporidial
        infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Although our results cannot be
        considered definitive, until there is more data, we would
        recommend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area,
        especially those with compromised immune systems, avoid tap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in other geographic areas may consider
        avoiding tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers</ENAMEX>
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) prevention
        Guidelines that, for a non-outbreak setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX> may consider tap water avoidance or boiling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> prior to drinking to reduce the risk of infection
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Whether it
        would be better to drink boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is
        unknown at this time, although our results suggest that
        appropriately bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> may be effective. Prevention of
        infection, either by avoidance of risky exposures or by
        improving immune function or both, is critical in this
        vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
