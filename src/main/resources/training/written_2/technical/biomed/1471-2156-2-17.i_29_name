        Dystrophinopathies are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> recessive diseases
        caused by primary dystrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, and include:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX> (DMD), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Becker Muscular</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dystrophy</ENAMEX> (BMD), manifesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD/BMD</ENAMEX> carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>,
        X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, isolated quadriceps
        myopathy, muscle cramps with myoglobinuria and asymptomatic
        elevation of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> gene spans <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs of genomic DNA
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kb transcript encodes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length protein</ENAMEX> (dystrophin) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">427</NUMEX> kiloDaltons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dystrophin</ENAMEX> is a sarcolemmal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that through its
        interaction with many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> participates in the
        linkage of the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Mutations in this gene result in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> or other dystrophinopathy. A major consequence of
        the dystrophin gene's large genomic size is a high rate of
        mutation; close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of cases prove to be spontaneous
        mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 60%</NUMEX> of mutations causing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> are deletions of large segments of the gene usually
        including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more exons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 5%</NUMEX> of
        mutations are duplications of large segments of the gene [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . Large deletions and duplications are detected using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplexed PCR</ENAMEX> primers to amplify a subset of
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 20</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>) exons that are empirically
        estimated to constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> of large deletions and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>. Thus, most but not all large deletions and
        duplications are detected by this test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The other
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of mutations are presumed to be point mutations such
        as, substitutions, deletions or insertions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
        several nucleotides leading to premature termination codons
        (nonsense or frame-shift mutations), amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> (missense and neutral mutations) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in splice sites. These mutations have remained
        undetected in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female, because
        available techniques are relatively expensive and laborious
        given the size of the dystrophin gene. Existing procedures
        for detection of point mutations include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> (single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> conformational polymorphism) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] , a variation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOVAM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Detection of Virtually All Mutations</ENAMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enhanced SSCP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heteroduplex Analysis</ENAMEX>)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein Truncation Test</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , DGGE
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> cleavage of mismatch [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleavage</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . Each of these procedures has its advantages and
        limitations but the size of the gene and the cost of the
        procedures have not made them routine in most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
        The purpose of this project was to develop an effective
        and convenient process to detect both large and small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> gene with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a moderate</NUMEX> increase
        in cost. In an effort to address these issues, we developed
        a new primer set to be used in conjunction with denaturing
        high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and
        dye-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminator sequencing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> has been developed to
        screen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> variations by separating heteroduplex and
        homoduplex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments by ion-pair reverse-phase liquid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . We used this technique to study
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> female carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of one
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Since this technique separates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroduplexes</ENAMEX> and homoduplexes, it can also be used to
        analyze manifesting and carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        We started the project with the intention of designing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> to amplify and sequence all of the exons of the
        dystrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR. In order
        to ensure detection of splice site as well as exon sequence
        alterations, genomic sequence surrounding each of the
        sequence-known fragments of dystrophin was mined from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> GenBank database. Primers were designed (see methods)
        that allowed for amplification of a product with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> - 100
        bases on either side of each exon. To look for point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were chosen as test cases based
        on the absence of dystrophin, clinical symptoms consistent
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> and no large deletion or duplication detected by
        the multiplexed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> test. In addition, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> thought
        to be a carrier female was also tested as described in the
        methods and summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        Initially the primers were used to prepare amplicons of
        dystrophin exons for direct sequencing. Likely
        disease-causative mutations were found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and confirmed in the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>
        by direct sequencing of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>, and the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR fragments, the last of which includes the dp427m
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. These were sequenced prior to our
        obtaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system for screening. When a likely
        disease-causative mutation was found in each of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, no further fragments were sequenced for that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 01</ENAMEX> and his carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> were shown to
        have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C->T</ENAMEX> substitution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 39 bp5762</TIMEX>, predicting a
        nonsense mutation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gln->Stop</ENAMEX>, leading to a likely
        disease-causative truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2and
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 02</ENAMEX> has an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> bp deletion in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> and patient
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX> is missing exon 21 which was not recognized until the
        end of the project and had not been detected by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplexed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> test because exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> is not one of the
        included exons in that test. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutations both
        create out of frame transcripts leading to eventual stop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> and premature truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">07</NUMEX>
        has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C->T</ENAMEX> substitution in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> at bp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3359</TIMEX> predicting
        a nonsense mutation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg->Stop</ENAMEX>, leading to a likely
        disease-causative truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 04</ENAMEX> has
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G->T</ENAMEX> substitution at base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">738</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> splice
        site. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> splice site is normally a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1805</TIMEX>
        sites examined in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 8</NUMEX> times is it a T
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The predicted aberrant splicing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 7</ENAMEX> makes
        this a likely causative mutation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system was obtained halfway into the study and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56 through 78</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR including
        exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> were analyzed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> prior to sequence
        analysis. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system, fragments are screened for
        variation in retention time or chromatogram shape from that
        of an unaffected control amplicon. Fragments exhibiting
        variation are then sequenced for confirmation and analysis.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX> variations were detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX>, both in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 59</TIMEX>, for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">05 and 06</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) (only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> 06 shown).
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments were sequenced and a
        non-disease-causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln->Arg</ENAMEX> missense mutation at bp
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9018</TIMEX> was found in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. As we found no likely
        disease-causative mutations in our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass DHPLC
        conditions, we sequenced all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56-78</NUMEX> and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of which contains
        exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> fragments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> x <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        fragments each) sequenced showed alterations which were not
        detected by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass temperatures chosen for DHPLC
        analysis. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is a polymorphism, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9857</TIMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C->T</ENAMEX> in
        intron <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>, in patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">06</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is a probable novel
        disease-causative mutation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10015</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G->A</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intron 67</TIMEX>,
        within the splice site consensus sequence in patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">08</NUMEX>.
        Based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX> donor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.16%</NUMEX>) were adenosine while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1468</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82.1%</NUMEX>) were guanosine at
        this position in the splice sequence making it likely that
        exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> will be aberrantly spliced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . When these two
        fragments were run on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> at the lower second
        pass temperatures indicated in Additional file A: Primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> temperatures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> spreadsheet, the
        alterations were detected (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2cand 2b</ENAMEX>). In addition,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> previously identified mutations were confirmed on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system, as was the carrier status of patient 01S
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        In total, likely disease-causative mutations were found
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male patients</ENAMEX> and confirmed in the
        carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> (patient 01s) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>). In addition, one silent and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> neutral
        polymorphisms, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> intronic alterations that have
        previously been shown to be present in unaffected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were found. One silent polymorphism and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        previously unreported intronic alterations were also found.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">05 and 06</TIMEX>, we did not find likely
        disease-causative mutations despite sequencing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX>
        fragments.
      
      
        Discussion
        We used a combination of direct sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> to
        search for mutations in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> and a carrier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>. Likely causative mutations were found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and confirmed in the carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. In our
        study, one likely causative mutation (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exn21</ENAMEX>)
        was found just by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> analysis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> likely causative
        mutations were first detected by direct sequencing but each
        was subsequently detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX>. Our experience
        indicates that the multiple different conditions of DHPLC
        would have detected all of these likely causative mutations
        and all polymorphisms. Direct sequencing of all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> is still more costly than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> and our results
        indicate that initial analysis using the far cheaper DHPLC
        should precede sequencing thus reducing cost of the
        analysis. Causative mutations were not found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Due to the enormous size of the dystrophin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs), finding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of mutations is
        improbable using these fragments because we cannot examine
        all the sequences and situations that might affect
        expression. It is possible, but unlikely, that one of the
        currently unknown alterations that we found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">05</TIMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">06</NUMEX> will eventually be proven a causative mutation
        rather than a polymorphism.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in which we found disease-causative
        mutations have affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in addition to
        patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">01</TIMEX>, have potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier sisters</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
        have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who could also be carriers. We have shown
        that, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system, it is now not only
        feasible but actually a simple process to determine if any
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> have the same point mutation as their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother/son</ENAMEX> and, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> testing and pre-natal
        diagnostic testing is now available to any of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who wish to use it.
        As larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are tested, a more
        accurate estimate of the percentage of undetectable
        causative mutations will emerge and present a clear new
        challenge. We estimate based on our small sample, and other
        unpublished data, that such cases will comprise a small
        percentage (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 8 percent</NUMEX>) of total DMD cases.
        Possible explanations for such cases include duplications
        which we may have missed, mutations in unknown enhancers or
        translation modifiers hidden in exons or introns, mutations
        that create novel splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and changes in the coding
        region which might be pathogenic but which, due to our lack
        of knowledge, are thought to be polymorphic. For example,
        changes to an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> that is essential for some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/protein interaction</ENAMEX> (potentially transportation),
        or is modified/processed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level but which we
        currently assume is just a polymorphic change. Other
        possible mechanisms include mosaicism, in which DNA
        extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX> has different sequence
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted from muscle cells, and cryptic
        chromosomal rearrangements. These will require dedicated
        efforts to resolve either individually case by case or to
        develop new, more comprehensive, routine tests, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and protein analysis. Fortunately, there are other
        methods for detection of point mutations that can be
        compared to, or used in addition to, the method presented
        here, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGGE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOVAM-S</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . More information on DGGE analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> can be
        found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leiden Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX> web site

        Clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> planning to begin testing for
        point as well as large mutations must clearly evaluate
        possible technologies in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> areas:
        effectiveness, convenience and cost.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> followed by sequencing improves the effectiveness
        of mutation detection from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>, using the existing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplexed</ENAMEX> PCR technology that detects large mutations
        only, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 92%</NUMEX> by including detection of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 75%</NUMEX> of point mutations as well. Clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> that are planning to screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using the technique presented here will produce
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important outcomes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> will be a more accurate
        measure of the effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> screening for
        sequence variation followed by direct sequencing. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> will be improvements in the conditions for mutation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX>. As new mutations are discovered,
        they could be entered into the database along with any
        suggested improvements to the DHPLC conditions for a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fragment/alteration.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> will be a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and tissue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 86</NUMEX> fragments were
        sequenced with no likely disease causing mutations
        detected. This will prove extremely useful for further
        investigations into the more subtle causes of
        dystrophin-deficient muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, this
        will provide procedures for the detection of mutations in
        dystrophin-absent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that will be more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>.
        The convenience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> followed by sequencing is
        readily apparent. It requires neither radioisotopes nor
        ethidium bromide gels when combined with a core sequencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> or capillary sequencer (See Additional file Bfor
        details).
        We found that the cost of reagents for DHPLC screening
        followed by direct sequencing was only moderately higher
        than the cost for the existing multiplexed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> test. The
        reagent cost of the existing multiplexed PCR diagnostic is
        estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.00</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Increasing the percentage
        of mutations detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the current <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 92%</NUMEX> by including point mutations would come
        at the moderate increase in reagent costs of approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$57.75</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> plus a moderate increase in other costs
        such as consumables and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> time. Although the
        initial investment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system is not minimal at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately $80,000</NUMEX>, the cost can be amortized over many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system can be used in the molecular
        diagnosis of many other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX>. The
        same, of course, is true for the purchase of an automated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencer</ENAMEX>. Details of the reagent costs per patient
        calculations are attached as Additional file <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Briefly</ENAMEX>, we
        assumed that likely disease-causative mutations would be
        found, on average, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 43</TIMEX> fragments. We
        calculated the cost of reagents per 50Î¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and the cost
        of reagents to run a sample on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system and
        multiplied by the number of samples required to screen a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. We estimated that there will be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four fragments</NUMEX> per
        patient that require sequencing. We calculated the reagent
        costs to amplify, purify and sequence these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> strands
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in both directions. We then combined the cost
        of the existing multiplex test for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> screening followed by direct sequencing
        for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to arrive at an average cost per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the increase over the average cost per patient
        for the existing multiplexed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> test alone.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Point mutations can be found in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD/BMD</ENAMEX> male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and asymptomatic or manifesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD/BMD</ENAMEX> carrier
        females via an effective and convenient process using
        automated DHPLC screening for variation and direct
        sequencing for confirmation and analysis at a moderate
        increase in cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. We have shown that it is now
        feasible for clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> to begin testing for
        both point mutations and large mutations in the dystrophin
        gene using this or one of the other available methods for
        mutation detection. The detection rate for all mutations in
        the DMD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> can be increased from the present <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> to above
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Patient materials
          After reviewing medical records, we studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had been diagnosed as having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> based on
          pathology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> report, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in the level of dystrophin expression
          either by immunofluorescence or western blot analysis. In
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, no large deletion or duplication was
          detected using the currently used primers. This current
          set consists of primers to amplify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">dp427m</NUMEX> promoter
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1</ENAMEX> and exons <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 6, 8</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 17, 19</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 60</TIMEX>. Although none of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX>, all were
          determined to be highly likely to have dystrophin gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, as opposed to other genetic causes of muscular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dystrophy</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> using the
          Puregene kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentra Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mn.</ENAMEX>). DNA
          concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. This
          study was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX>
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX>, and informed consent was
          obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or legal guardians of participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX>.

          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI/Genbank</ENAMEX> using an iterative electronic data

          Starting with known mRNA sequence (accession <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ml 8533</ENAMEX>),
          the accession numbers referenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) contain most
          of the sequence obtained. Many compromises are involved
          in selection of primer sequences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> listed in
          Additional file A: Primer sequences and DHPLC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">temperatures Excel</ENAMEX> spreadsheet were designed using the
          Primer3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ma</ENAMEX>.) and OLIGO
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Biology Insights, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cascade, Co.</ENAMEX>)
          software packages with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> goals in mind. These
          were:
          a) to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of intronic sequence
          adjacent to each exon at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of the
          exon
          b) to create a single, visible, specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of
          reasonable intensity when analyzed on agarose gel
          c) to create fragments that have melting
          characteristics appropriate for cost-effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>
          variation screening by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> analysis. Appropriate
          melting characteristics are such that variations from
          unaffected sequence in any portion of the fragment will
          be detected using ideally only one running temperature
          but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than three</NUMEX> (see Additional file A: Primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> temperatures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> spreadsheet)
          d) to provide clean sequence in both directions
          without resorting to additional primers designed simply
          for sequencing the amplicon.
          All these goals were met by the primer set presented
          here. The primer set and the sequence of the fragments as
          well as additional intron sequence are available on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leiden Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX> pages

          these primers could be grouped into sets for multiplex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in order to initially screen for large mutations
          using the same primers presented here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiplexed</ENAMEX> PCR
          could be run on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> system in a size detection mode

          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> or process could be provided within the
