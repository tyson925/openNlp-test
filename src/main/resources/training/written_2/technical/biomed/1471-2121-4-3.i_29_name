        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mammalian protein phosphatase 5</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PP5</NUMEX>) and its homolog
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase T1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ppt1p</NUMEX>) from the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain a
        catalytic domain structurally related to the catalytic
        subunits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A and PP2B</TIMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain
        consisting of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) not
        found in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . Homologs have also been identified in 
        Xenopus laevis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , 
        Neurospora crassa [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , 
        Trypanosoma brucei [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , 
        Plasmodium falciparum [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cauliflower</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and homologs for 
        Caenorhabditis elegans,
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe and 
        Arabidopsis thaliana are predicted
        (accession number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB60937</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAA17690 and AAD21727</TIMEX>,
        respectively).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein phosphatase 5</ENAMEX> has been implicated in the control
        of cell proliferation, in hormonal signal transduction, and
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hsp90</TIMEX> chaperone function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        However little is known about the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> or its
        specific role in these pathways, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> physiological
        substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> has been identified to date, the
        apoptosis signaling kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ASK 1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . PP5 can be
        activated by lipid 
        in vitro , and removal of the TPR
        domain or the C terminus generates an active, lipid
        insensitive form of the enzyme [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . PP5
        phosphatase activity is also altered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hCRY2</TIMEX> and a
        fragment of hsp90 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . These findings
        suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> may be autoinhibited and that the binding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> or lipids to the TPR domain could
        potentially control PP5 activity in cells, however no
        reports have yet documented how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> is regulated 
        in vivo . The activity of PP5
        homologs from cauliflower, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> brucei and 
        P. falciparum is stimulated by
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] and removal of
        the TPR domain from 
        P. falciparum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> increases activity
        to the same extent as lipid treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . This
        suggests that the TPR domain plays a similar inhibitory
        role for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>.
        Genetic analyses in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae have yielded few clues
        about the function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. Budding yeast lacking 
        PPT1 do not exhibit obvious growth
        defects or detectable phenotypes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Disruption of 
        PPT1 together with one of the other
        known phosphatases in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> also reveals no obvious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Thus, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> has an essential function
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> can also carry out this role. In this report we
        have characterized the activity of recombinant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>,
        analyzed its expression at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA,
        and localized Ppt1p in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Ppt1p can be activated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipid</ENAMEX>, is most highly expressed in early log phase growth,
        and is present throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Comparison of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p and PP5</TIMEX> activity and response
          to lipid treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant Ppt1p</ENAMEX> expressed as a GST-fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          then affinity purified and released from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> by thrombin
          cleavage yielded a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the expected molecular
          weight, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> kDa (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">assayed</ENAMEX> side-by-side, the
          basal specific activities for recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> and PP5
          were similar toward the artificial substrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P-MBP</ENAMEX> and
          32P-casein, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX>, the
          dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P-MBP</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> was stimulated by
          arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and other unsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX> lacking either a double bond or a carboxylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were not effective (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          In the case of pNPP hydrolysis, others have reported
          both saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A
          esters stimulate PP5 activity, with concentrations
          required for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal stimulation approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> lower than those of their corresponding free
          fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . We therefore tested whether a
          saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A ester could also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stimulate Ppt1p.</ENAMEX> Ppt1p activity toward <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-MBP was
          stimulated by arachidoyl coenzyme A in a concentration
          range similar to that observed for AA, with half-maximal
          stimulation occurring at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 50 Î</NUMEX>¼M for
          arachidoyl coenzyme A and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 Î</NUMEX>¼M for AA. However, in
          contrast to AA stimulation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> activity dropped off
          sharply at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">¼M arachidoyl coenzyme A</ENAMEX> and higher.
          Similar results were observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> (data not shown).
          This suggests that double bonds are not required to
          observe the effect of fatty acyl coenzyme A esters.
          Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> toward <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-casein
          was not stimulated by AA, arachidoyl coenzyme A, or
          linoleoyl coenzyme A over a range in concentration from
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-500 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band data not shown). Other unsaturated
          fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> also failed to stimulate Ppt1p activity with
          this substrate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These data indicate that Ppt1p
          is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, as well as
          by a saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A derivative, toward
          some but not all substrates dephosphorylated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteolysis</ENAMEX> of Ppt1p
          Removal of the TPR domain of PP5 by limited
          proteolysis increases enzyme activity and the TPR domain
          binds lipid [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Using conditions similar to
          those employed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, digestion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> with trypsin
          in the absence of lipid produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> kDa catalytic
          fragment that was stable for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa
          fragment that was degraded within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence analysis showed that these fragments
          are derived from the catalytic and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The crystal structure of the
          PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domain revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> followed by an
          extended Î± helix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , however Ppt1p was originally
          proposed to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
          pattern of proteolysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of cleavage for Ppt1p
          are very similar to those seen with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> under these same
          conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . This indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> also
          contains an accessible region linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> and
          catalytic domains and is most consistent with the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. Limited tryptic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î¼M</NUMEX> AA generated a
          distinct pattern of fragmentation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was observed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> times, but a series of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fragments ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 10</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX> as the amount of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa fragment
          decreased. These fragments, which are derived from the
          TPR domain, were not observed in the absence of AA,
          suggesting that lipid binding alters the conformation of
          this domain and its susceptibility to proteolysis. A
          similar change in susceptibility to proteolysis upon
          lipid binding was observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . As with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>,
          only lipids that stimulated 32P-MBP dephosphorylation
          slowed degradation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa TPR fragment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Removal of the TPR domain from Ppt1p by trypsin
          treatment had no effect on its activity toward
          32P-casein, but increased activity toward <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-MBP
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). AA did not stimulate
          32P-MBP dephosphorylation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> after removal of the
          TPR domain (data not shown). Thus, lipids that activate
          Ppt1p alter the sensitivity of the TPR domain to
          proteolysis, and removal of the TPR domain causes a loss
          of the response of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ppt1p</NUMEX> to lipid. However, removal of
          the TPR domain only modestly increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> activity, in
          contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-25</ENAMEX> fold elevation reported after TPR
          removal from PP5 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Although we cannot rule out
          the possibility that proteolyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is unresponsive to
          lipid because it is unstable, the observations that the
          catalytic fragment remains undegraded and control
          activity is not decreased argue against this possibility.
          Alternatively, an inhibitory element in the linker region
          may remain after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domain removal.
        
        
          The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal truncation on Ppt1p
          activity
          Removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> from the C terminus of PP5
          results in a highly active enzyme that is only modestly
          stimulated by lipid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . To examine the role of the C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> in controlling <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ppt1p</NUMEX> phosphatase activity, a
          similar truncation mutant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-504</ENAMEX>), was expressed
          and characterized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Compared to full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-504</ENAMEX>) exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> specific activity with both 32P-casein and
          32P-MBP. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipid</ENAMEX> did not stimulate Ppt1p (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-504</ENAMEX>) toward
          32P-casein, but still increased activity with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-MBP
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-fold</NUMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal truncation of PP5
          activates the enzyme as extensively as lipid treatment,
          and little further activation is seen with lipid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          In the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, subtilisin digestion removed both the
          TPR domain and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C terminus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The observation
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal truncation increased Ppt1p activity
          toward both 32P-casein and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P-MBP</ENAMEX>, but subtilisin
          digestion increased activity only toward <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-MBP (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C) suggests that the C terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> remained
          intact during subtilisin digestion. However, mass
          analysis of the subtilisin-derived catalytic fragment
          would be required to confirm this.
        
        
          Expression and localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> in yeast
          cells
          To examine when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is expressed and where it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">localized</ENAMEX>, a yeast strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">WHT4-1</ENAMEX>) was generated in which
          the 
          PPT1 gene was replaced with cDNA
          encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Ppt1p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX>).
          Immunoblotting showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> levels were highest
          in early log phase, and then decreased dramatically
          during the stationary phase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A,4<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          analysis showed that the 
          PPT1 mRNA levels also increased in
          early log phase and decreased as the cell division
          decreased upon entering the stationary phase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C),
          correlating with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression. The pattern of 
          PPT1 gene expression was identical
          in wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX>,
          indicating that the epitope tag did not alter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or message stability (data not shown).
          Cells in early log phase growth when 
          PPT1 gene expression was maximal
          were used to localize <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX>. Indirect
          immunofluorescence was required to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX>.
          Fluorescence microscopy indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> was
          present throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, including the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5A). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Localization</ENAMEX> and staining intensity did not appear
          to change as a function of bud size or morphology,
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> expression and localization is not
          cell cycle dependent.
          To confirm that the indirect immunofluorescence
          procedure did not generate artifacts, the localization of
          the spindle pole body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Spc42p</ENAMEX> was also examined by
          this method. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> centromeric plasmid encoding the
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Spc42p-EGFP was transformed into W303
          cells. Direct fluorescence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> and indirect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> using the amplification protocol with
          anti-EGFP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> were compared. Both signals revealed
          specific localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spc42p-EGFP</ENAMEX> to the spindle pole
          body (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> was overexpressed from the
          
          GAL1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in a centromeric or
          episomal plasmid, respectively, indirect
          immunofluorescence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> or direct fluorescence
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-Ppt1p</ENAMEX> showed that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were also
          localized throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        PP5 and its homologs in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> represent a
        subfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> enzymes distinguished by the presence of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain containing multiple TPR repeats. Ppt1p
        from the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> homolog of mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> to be described. Thus far,
        genetic approaches have not revealed functions for budding
        yeast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. In this report, we have characterized Ppt1p
        activity 
        in vitro and examined its
        expression.
        In the case of mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, results from lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> and binding, limited proteolysis and truncation
        studies taken together suggest the TPR domain and the C
        terminus inhibit PP5 activity in a coordinated manner and
        that lipid binding to the TPR domain activates the enzyme 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . In the
        present study we used assay conditions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ppt1p</NUMEX> identical
        to those in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> was shown to be activated by removal
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Under these
        conditions Ppt1p is also stimulated by lipids toward
        32P-MBP, and activating lipids slow TPR domain proteolysis.
        These results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> has a similar domain
        structure to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">PP5</NUMEX> and is activated in a similar manner by
        lipid binding to the TPR domain. Removal of the TPR domain
        prevents stimulation by lipid, but only modestly increases
        Ppt1p activity. Carboxyl-terminal truncation modestly
        increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> activity toward both 32P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBP</ENAMEX> and
        32P-casein, and does not prevent further lipid stimulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P-MBP</ENAMEX> dephosphorylation. These results distinguish
        Ppt1p from mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> and suggest that the C terminus is
        less important in controlling Ppt1p activity. Although more
        work will be required to determine its role in lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX>, removal of the TPR domain had only a small
        effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> activation. Ppt1p contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX> short
        stretches of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-residue sequence between the
        linker helix and the catalytic domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 174-188</ENAMEX>),
        and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-residue sequence just preceding the extreme C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 474-484</ENAMEX>), that are not found in other
        PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> reported thus far ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] ,
        and accession numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB60937</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAA17690 and AAD21727</TIMEX>). The
        presence of these additional sequences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX> may
        underlie the differences in the responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> and PP5
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal truncation. Additional studies will be
        required to determine if our observations reflect
        structural and regulatory properties unique to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>.
        Ppt1p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> exhibit similar specific activities toward
        32P-casein in the absence of lipid. However Ppt1p activity
        toward this substrate was not stimulated by lipids. These
        results highlight the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> often exhibit
        substrate specific effects 
        in vitro and that the use of a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> to study this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of enzymes can be
        misleading. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX>, the control activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is low
        toward the commonly used artificial substrates such as
        32P-casein and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P-MBP</ENAMEX> compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . Thus, it is not clear whether the selective lipid
        stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> toward <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBP</ENAMEX> reflects a
        substrate-directed effect, or whether 32P-casein is simply
        a poor substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egloff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> acidic surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on the catalytic
        face of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1c Î³</TIMEX> that are replaced by neutral or basic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . They suggest the presence of
        these acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1c Î³</TIMEX> may explain why casein is a
        good substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>, but not for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>. Based on a
        sequence alignment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1c Î³</TIMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        are not conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. Using the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Modeller</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        ] , a homology model of the catalytic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> was
        built based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> - PDB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] codes 1FJM [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1IT6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        and 1JK7 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . This model shows that the catalytic face
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is generally less acidic than that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1c Î³</TIMEX> and
        does not indicate the presence of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidic residues</ENAMEX>
        that could act in the same fashion as those on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1c Î³</TIMEX>. Thus
        the reason for low Ppt1p activity toward this acidic
        substrate may be more complex than can be explained by
        electrostatic repulsion.
        Others have proposed that fatty acyl coenzyme A esters
        are potential physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, since these
        compounds stimulate pNPP hydrolysis by PP5 
        in vitro at physiologically relevant
        concentrations and are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10-fold</NUMEX> more potent
        than their free fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> counterparts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Although
        we confirmed this observation using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> and pNPP (data not
        shown), in our hands similar levels of AA and arachidoyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coenzyme A</ENAMEX> were required for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal stimulation of
        32P-MBP dephosphorylation in the case of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> and
        PP5. Although more work is required to examine this issue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thoroughly</ENAMEX>, our results suggest that the large differences
        in potency between free fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and fatty acyl coenzyme
        A esters seen using pNPP may not extend to all protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. In addition, it will be important to determine
        if lipids in any form play a role in the regulation of PP5
        or Ppt1p 
        in vivo .
        Ppt1p was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae . No difference in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartmentalization</ENAMEX> or staining intensity in cells was
        observed as a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> or bud size. This suggests
        that the level or localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is not controlled
        as a function of cell cycle progression. Both nuclear and
        cytoplasmic localization have been reported for other PP5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX>. In some cases, including 
        P. falciparum and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells, nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> appeared more intense than cytoplasmic staining [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 9</NUMEX> ] . Based on studies with heterologously expressed
        human PP5-GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, it has been proposed that
        nuclear localization requires a stretch of sequence in the
        C terminus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . However, other sequences or signals are
        also likely to contribute to nuclear localization of PP5
        and its homologs, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX>, which are
        identical to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> in this region do not appear to be
        nuclear in all cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . In addition 
        P. falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> is primarily
        nuclear [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , although it is not well conserved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">relevant C-</ENAMEX>terminal region but contains a potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">bipartite</ENAMEX> nuclear localization signal not found in other
        PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> reported thus far. The functional
        significance of differential localization is not known at
        this time.
        Ppt1p levels are highest during periods of rapid growth
        and drop off when growth slows (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B), raising the
        possibility that this enzyme may have a role in controlling
        cell growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and its expression may be regulated by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> or nutritional signal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The observation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that Ppt1p</TIMEX> levels rose and fell in parallel with mRNA
        levels suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> expression is primarily
        controlled at the level of gene transcription. Studies of
        PP5 and its homologs in cultured cells and various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> also suggest it may play a role in development [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] or during rapid cell growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 7</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Ppt1p shares several biochemical properties with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> and
        other homologs, including a similar domain structure and
        stimulation by lipid 
        in vitro . Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is not
        fully activated by removal of the TPR domain or by removal
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9 C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, suggesting that these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> may
        not play an autoinhibitory role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p</TIMEX>. Ppt1p is
        expressed in early log phase growth and decreases
        dramatically as cells approach the stationary phase,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> could play a role in cell growth or
        may be controlled by metabolic or nutritional signals. Like
        PP5, the observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is localized in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and cytoplasm implies that it may function in
        several subcellular compartments.
        Although our findings suggest some differences may exist
        in regulatory properties of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p and PP5</TIMEX>, many biochemical
        and cellular properties are shared. In addition a recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is co-purified with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp82p</ENAMEX> and
        Hsc82p, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hsp90</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        ] , indicating that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ppt1p and PP5</TIMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protein partner</ENAMEX> and suggesting that, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX>, Ppt1p
        functions in chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Thus, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ppt1p</ENAMEX> is likely to be a
        valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for probing the cellular role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>.
