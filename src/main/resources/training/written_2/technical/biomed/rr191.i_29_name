        Fetuses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic mothers</ENAMEX> with uncontrolled blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels tend to be hyperglycemic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperinsulinemic</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . An increased incidence of neonatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX> (RDS) has been observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic mothers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDS</ENAMEX> is caused by
        inadequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant due to delayed
        lung development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It has been proposed that high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels can delay lung development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic mother</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Surfactant, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> comprised of phospholipids
        (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>), functions
        to reduce surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at
        end expiration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The surfactant-associated proteins
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>) A, B, C and D, which are required for proper
        surfactant function, are developmentally and hormonally
        regulated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We, and others, have shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A
        levels in the amniotic fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic mothers</ENAMEX> are
        significantly decreased [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low SP-A</ENAMEX> levels in amniotic
        fluid have been correlated with an increased incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neonatal RDS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Our previous studies have shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> down-regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in
        human lung epithelial cells in a concentration and
        time-dependent manner via an inhibition of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> transduces its cellular signal in most cell
        types via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> signaling pathways, i.e., the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX>
        mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) pathway and the
        phosphatidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PI 3-kinase</ENAMEX>) pathway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insulin</ENAMEX> initially binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> receptor causing
        autophosphorylation of the Î²-subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase domain of the Î²-subunit then
        phosphorylates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tyrosine residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS-2, IRS-3</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shc</ENAMEX>, which then
        activates the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> MAPK signaling cascade [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . PD98059
        is a cell permeable, non-competitive, reversible inhibitor
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAPK</ENAMEX>/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK),
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> upstream of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated IRS</ENAMEX> also activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-kinase pathway</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 10</NUMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX>, well-characterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitors of the PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase pathway, i.e., wortmannin,
        LY294002, and rapamycin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wortmannin</ENAMEX> and
        LY294002 block the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase itself [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        ] , while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rapamycin</ENAMEX> prevents the phosphorylation of a
        downstream effector in the pathway, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In the present study, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental models, a
        human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H441</NUMEX>, and human
        fetal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">explants</ENAMEX>. H441 cells resemble bronchiolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">epithelial Clara</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in phenotype and produce both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The hormonal regulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A and SP-B</ENAMEX> gene expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H441</NUMEX> cells is similar
        to that observed in differentiated type II cells in human
        fetal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">explants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 15 16</NUMEX> ] . We treated H441 cells
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of signal transduction:
        wortmannin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LY294002</TIMEX>, rapamycin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX>, to elucidate
        which signaling pathways are activated when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibits SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression. To confirm these results, we
        repeated key experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and the signal
        transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> using human fetal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">explants</ENAMEX>. We
        then examined the levels and phosphorylation state of key
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> probably inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene
        expression in lung epithelial cells via the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rapamycin-sensitive PI 3-kinase pathway.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cell and explant cultures
          A human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H441</NUMEX>, was
          maintained 
          in vitro in monolayer culture in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">U/ml</ENAMEX>), streptomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) and fungizone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> atmosphere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Culture media
          were changed every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and cells were passed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:4</ENAMEX>)
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitor</ENAMEX> experiments, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H441</TIMEX> cells
          were grown until ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> confluent, then incubated in
          serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> prior to an experiment. The
          cultured cells were subsequently exposed to fresh
          serum-free media and pretreated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 minutes</TIMEX> with
          either control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that contained the vehicle for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (dimethyl sulphoxide) or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that
          contained wortmannin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-200 nM</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LY294002</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-50 Î¼M</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapamycin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-100 nM</ENAMEX>), or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PD98059</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5-25 Î¼M</NUMEX>). After
          pretreatment, either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) or vehicle
          (dilute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX>) was added for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 12-16 hours</TIMEX>.
          Experiments were repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</NUMEX> times unless
          otherwise noted.
          Human lung tissue was obtained from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-tremester</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abortuses</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-21 weeks old</TIMEX>), dissected free from blood
          vessels and conducting airways, then minced with a
          sterile razor blade into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3explants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The
          explants were maintained on lens paper-covered stainless
          steel grids at the air-media interface in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waymouth</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were changed
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last day</TIMEX> of culture, explants were
          pretreated with signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, either
          wortmannin, rapamycin or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059</TIMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 min</TIMEX> and then
          further treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX>.
          Experiments were performed in duplicate and were repeated
          twice.
        
        
          Reagents
          Porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calbiochem</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), wortmannin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LY294002</TIMEX>, and rapamycin were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma-Aldrich Company</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> Biolabs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> was prepared as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml
          stock solution in ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N HCl</ENAMEX>, aliquoted and stored at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-80Â°C.</ENAMEX> Wortmannin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LY294002</TIMEX>, rapamycin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstituted</ENAMEX> in dimethyl sulphoxide as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼M</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM stock solutions, respectively, and stored at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80Â°C</NUMEX> in aliquots. Insulin causes a time- and
          dose-dependent inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression with
          maximum effect at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~40 to 400 nM</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          In order to achieve a maximal inhibitory effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, we used a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml in the
          present study.
        
        
          Transcription run-on assay
          Nuclear isolation, transcription elongation reactions
          and hybridizations were performed as described previously
          with minor modifications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subconfluent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H441</ENAMEX> cells
          were incubated in serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and then
          exposed to media plus either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours</TIMEX>. The cells
          were then rinsed and trypsinized, and nuclei from control
          and treated cells were harvested. The transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX> reaction was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Ã— 10 6nuclei</NUMEX>.
          Labeled, newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was then isolated and
          purified from the nuclei. Nytran membranes with
          immobilized cDNAs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlueScript</ENAMEX> vector, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP</ENAMEX>-A
          and human Î±-actin were prehybridized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of buffer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 X SSC, 5 X Denhardt</ENAMEX>'s solution, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>

          45Â°C and then hybridized to the labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 Ã— 10</ENAMEX> 6cpm
          in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNasin</ENAMEX>) in duplicate for
          an additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 hours</TIMEX>. Afterwards, the hybridized
          membranes were washed twice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> SSC with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at
          55Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, once in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 X</ENAMEX> SSC at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, once
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 X</ENAMEX> SSC with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml RNase A at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min and</TIMEX>
          then rinsed twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 X</ENAMEX> SSC at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min. Membranes</ENAMEX> were exposed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storage Phosphor Screen</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-5
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, scanned using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhosphorImager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>)
          and data quantitated using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quantity One</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Northern blot analysis
          Northern blot analysis was used to semi-quantitate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> mRNA levels. H441 cells were harvested and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          isolated as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Equal amounts
          of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each condition were separated on
          agarose gels, transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nytran</ENAMEX>-plus membranes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schleicher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schuell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), and
          subsequently hybridized with a radiolabeled human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP</ENAMEX>-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX>. Radioactive bands were detected using X-ray film
          after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-4 hour</TIMEX> exposure with an intensifier screen at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-70Â°C.</ENAMEX> The relative intensity of the reactive bands was
          estimated by densitometry and corrected for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> loading
          as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          To perform a northern blot analysis of the human fetal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> explant samples, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each
          condition were immobilized on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nytran</ENAMEX>-plus membranes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼m</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schleicher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuell</ENAMEX>) in triplicate in denaturing

          using a slot blot apparatus. The membranes were then
          processed for northern blot analysis as described above.
          In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each explant sample
          were separated on agarose gels to ensure the quality of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> and to correct for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA loading</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunoblotting
          The total amount and phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> were assessed using immunoblot
          analysis according to the methods described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharma</ENAMEX> and

          Transcription rate of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP</ENAMEX>-A
          In our previous studies, we have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>

          and then treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) or vehicle for

          (data are the mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments performed in
          duplicate plus or minus the standard deviation of the
          mean). In order to prove that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> can be
          stimulated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H441</NUMEX> cells by an activator of this kinase,

          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX> caused an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> twofold
          increase in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation over control

          The total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase present in the cells
          decreased during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 16 hour</TIMEX> incubation period, however,
          there was no difference in the amount present in control
          vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin-</ENAMEX>treated cells at any time-point (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Bshows that despite increased basal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase
          phosphorylation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> caused an additional
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr389</TIMEX> after incubation
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min to 16 hours</TIMEX>. Phosphorylation of
          p70 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S6</NUMEX> kinase on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr389</TIMEX> is essential for the activation
          of the kinase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, the
          intensity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thr389 p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase bands was
          significantly increased after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> min exposure and reached
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.02 Â± 0.31</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min and 1.36 Â± 0.17</TIMEX> after a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 hour</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">incubation</TIMEX> period when compared to respective controls

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p70 S6 kinase Thr421/Ser424</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 30-min and 2-hour</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">incubation</NUMEX> times when compared to their respective

          PD98059 caused a dramatic decrease in the
          phosphorylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX>, in the presence or
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A) when compared to controls.
          Incubation of cells with rapamycin did not affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation in any condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B).
          Rapamycin completely abolished the phosphorylation of
          Thr389 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p70 S6</TIMEX> kinase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin-</ENAMEX>treated cells and also
          abolished the basal phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cells, at both time points examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapamycin</ENAMEX> also down regulated the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Thr421/</ENAMEX>Ser424

        Discussion
        Nothing is known about the relationship between
        signaling pathways and the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene
        expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> signal
        transduction pathways are well-characterized in a wide
        variety of cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 10</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> is known to
        primarily transduce its cellular actions via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> signaling
        pathways, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 10</ENAMEX> ] . In the present study, we investigated
        the signaling pathways that mediate the inhibitory effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> on the expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> epithelial cells.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase, wortmannin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LY294002</ENAMEX>,
        and an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase activation, rapamycin,
        blocked the inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene
        expression. We confirmed these observations by showing that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> increased the phosphorylation of a specific
        rapamycin-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">threonine 389</ENAMEX>), present in the
        linker region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, a phosphorylation event
        that is known to activate this enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
        PD98059, an inhibitor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation, did not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> the inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene
        expression. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> had no effect on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> incubation. The
        effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression were evaluated using two
        experimental models, a human immortalized epithelial cell
        line (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H441</NUMEX> cells) and human fetal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">explants</ENAMEX>. We also
        demonstrated that transcriptional inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commences</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of exposure to the hormone.
        Together, our results are suggestive that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> activates
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rapamycin-sensitive PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase pathway in lung
        epithelial cells and that this event leads to an inhibition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene transcription.
        We found that wortmannin and rapamycin had no effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">basal SP-A</ENAMEX> mRNA levels, at any concentration tested.
        However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059</TIMEX>, added alone, abolished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> MAPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and also inhibited basal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. We hypothesize
        that a basal level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> MAPK activity may be required
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chess</ENAMEX> and coworkers have shown
        that transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î±</ENAMEX> and hepatocyte growth
        factor increase the phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p44/p42 MAPK</ENAMEX> in H441
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Epidermal growth factor, which binds to the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î±</ENAMEX>, increases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> content in human fetal lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Hepatocyte growth
        factor has also been shown to upregulate the synthesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> type II cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Thus, phosphorylation of
        p44<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/42 MAPK</ENAMEX> may be involved in the up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A
        gene expression, results consistent with our observation
        that inhibition of basal levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> MAPK
        phosphorylation may decrease <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression.
        In summary, our studies are suggestive that in lung
        epithelial cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene transcription is inhibited by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rapamycin-sensitive PI 3-kinase pathway,</ENAMEX>
        but not the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway. In cultured human muscle
        cells, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-kinase - p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase pathway, and
        not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway, mediates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> up-regulation of
        p85Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, in L6
        myotubes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> induces hexokinase II gene transcription
        via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rapamycin-sensitive PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase pathway, but not
        via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-kinase - p70</ENAMEX> S6
        kinase pathway, but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway, mediates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-6</ENAMEX>-phosphate dehydrogenase gene
        expression in primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In H411E
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> down-regulates cAMP-induced
        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription via
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase pathway, but not via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        present in the nucleus in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin-</ENAMEX>treated cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Moreover, it has been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> and activates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> response
        element modulator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        These data raise the possibility that transcriptional
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene expression occurs via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-kinase - p70 S6</ENAMEX> kinase pathway. Further studies will be
        required to elucidate the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> in the
        nuclear events involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene transcription.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Our studies are suggestive that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin inhibits SP</ENAMEX>-A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene transcription</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase pathway in lung
        epithelial cells, specifically via the rapamycin-sensitive
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p70 S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> does not activate
        p44<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/42 MAPK</ENAMEX> and does not inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>-A gene transcription
        via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway. Our findings further characterize the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways that control surfactant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX> expression. This information could lead to the
        possible modification of these pathways by pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in order to modulate the composition of pulmonary
        surfactant, which is critical for normal respiratory
        function and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defense mechanisms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>.
