        The field of genomics has been expanding at a rapid pace
        since the annotated 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> was
        published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], with the current number of
        published genomes exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> and with another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">364</NUMEX> on
        their way according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genomes OnLine Database</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. Deciphering the functions encoded by all gene products
        of the genomes is the next big challenge in the field.
        Function attributions through experimental, biochemical and
        genetic analyses and through bioinformatic studies are
        continuing, and microarray technology is shedding
        additional light on the functions associated with the gene
        products of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in question. The wealth of
        biological information on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> is still increasing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and
        is contributing to a better understanding of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        as well as of functions encoded in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. It is
        therefore important that the most up-to-date information on
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene products</ENAMEX> is available
        and used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> have been assembled for various areas
        of knowledge about the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        Each compilation has a different emphasis and collects
        different sets of information related to the function of
        the gene products. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> database, we have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curating</ENAMEX> information on physiological function and modular
        construction of gene products. Other databases most closely
        related to ours include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoCyc</ENAMEX>, with emphasis on metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], the CGSC database, with information on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypes</ENAMEX> and phenotypes of mutant strains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and
        EcoGene, which includes information on gene
        reconstructions, alternative gene boundaries and verified
        amino-terminal amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequences of the mature proteins
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> genome project at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX> presents genome data on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> and pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterobacteria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        We present a functional update for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> that
        incorporates information from the literature and referenced
        databases obtained since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1997</TIMEX> GenBank deposit. Our
        focus has been the biological function of the gene
        products. Coding sequences (CDSs) encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose
        function previously was imputed or not known were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-evaluated, and putative functions were assigned by
        manually evaluating the results from BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DARWIN</ENAMEX> (data
        analysis and retrieval with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">indexed nucleotide</ENAMEX>/peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>) analyses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> (multipurpose automated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> project investigation environment) genome annotation
        system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] was also applied. MAGPIE detected alternative
        boundaries for some of the open reading frames (ORFs).

          genes were identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blattner</ENAMEX> numbers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnums</ENAMEX>).
          Among the genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,288</NUMEX> were believed to encode proteins
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> to encode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. Since then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bnums</ENAMEX> have been

          ( 
          thiS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">032583</NUMEX>) and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA encoding b4408</ENAMEX>. The current number of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,401</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,285</NUMEX>
          encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,527</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> CDSs that were
          assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> identifiers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnums</ENAMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>] for details). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,285</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnums</ENAMEX> were
          also identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnums</ENAMEX>. Variations were detected
          for either the start or stop positions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,077</NUMEX> of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> resulting in differences in the encoded proteins
          ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 147</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, the latter in PtsA

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">candidate CDSs</ENAMEX> include retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bnums</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magnums</ENAMEX>), CDSs
          located between the boundaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnums</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">506</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnums</ENAMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> overlapping existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bnums</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">730</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnums</ENAMEX>). Among
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magnums</ENAMEX> located between the boundaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnums</ENAMEX> are
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 CDSs</TIMEX> that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> or more amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
          One such CDS identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnum ec</ENAMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2510</TIMEX>) is
          located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between b1624</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b1625</ENAMEX> and encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of
          66 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The carboxy-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of
          this CDS are identical to the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence of the

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P56976</ENAMEX>) located at the same position [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magnums</ENAMEX> located between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnum</ENAMEX> boundaries may
          correspond to short

          Functional annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coliK</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> gene
          products
          The functional assignments of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene products</ENAMEX> in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 97</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank U00096</ENAMEX> deposit represented an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of information retrieved from the literature
          (collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoCyc</ENAMEX> databases) as well
          as imputed functions based on similarity of a known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the translated sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Since the
          deposit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> was made, our database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> has
          continually been updated with knowledge on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene products</ENAMEX> appearing in
          the literature [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 13</ENAMEX>]. Information on transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> has been incorporated from the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>
          Collado-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>], and transport protein
          information has been adapted from the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.H. Saier</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.T. Paulsen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> also contains
          imputed function assignments based on sequence similarity
          to orthologous or paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (operon)
          location and on phenotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          Gene products whose functions were known were not
          considered further for the functional update. The
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,294</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> whose gene products had a putative
          or unknown function assignment were analyzed using BLAST
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DARWIN</ENAMEX>. BLAST analyses were carried out for both the
          Bnum- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magnum</ENAMEX>-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. The
          results for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bnum</ENAMEX>-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> and the
          automatic functions predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX>
          (human-emulated reasoning for objective notations) were
          manually evaluated and imputed functions were assigned.
          Although the manual annotation step could not compete
          with the speed of the automatic annotation process of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX>, it provided us with more useful function
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptions</ENAMEX>. A comparison of the manually assigned
          putative functions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX> predicted functions
          showed that when leaving aside issues of specificity, a
          nearly equivalent function was predicted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> of the
          cases, whereas in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of the cases less information was
          obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX>.
          After the function update of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,294</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,306</NUMEX>
          gene products were assigned a putative function and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX>
          gene products were described by a phenotype. The
          remaining gene products were given one of the following
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assignments: 'conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>', where
          sequence-similar matches were found but the function
          could not be determined in the absence of consistent
          functions reported for the matching sequences; 'conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothetical protein</ENAMEX>', where sequence-similar matches
          existed but these had no associated function; 'unknown
          CDS', where the translated sequence had no known sequence
          match outside 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. The current function
          description includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">282</NUMEX>
          conserved hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX> unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">862</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> with no function assignment represent
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6%</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli chromosomal genes</ENAMEX>, and the
          unknown CDSs at this time represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.4%</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX>.
          A sample of the annotated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Each gene is identified by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnum, Magnum</ENAMEX>, gene
          product type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> (Function <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>). A
          complete table of the current <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,401</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnums</ENAMEX> is available as
          an additional data file online and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In
          this table the genes are identified by their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnum</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bnum_module</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bnum</ENAMEX> start and stop position, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magnum</ENAMEX>, Magnum
          start and stop position, and gene product type. The
          functions of the gene products are described by the
          currently annotated function (Function <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>) and by
          the function in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> deposit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Function November</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). A continually updated table that contains the
          functions of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene products</ENAMEX> is available
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
          Many changes are evident when comparing the updated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of 1997</TIMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> without
          function assignment has been reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,354 to 862</NUMEX>.
          This reduction is due to functions being experimentally
          determined (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> CDSs), assignment of putative functions
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">367</NUMEX> CDSs), phenotype-associated functions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> CDSs), and
          genes identified as belonging to phages (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX> CDSs). In
          addition, inferred function assignments were withdrawn
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">104</TIMEX> CDS-coded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose functions remain
          unknown.
          The number of gene products with putative function
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignments</ENAMEX> has changed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,120 to 1,306</NUMEX>. New
          functions were inferred for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX>. Putative function
          assignments were also removed as a result of new
          experimental data (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> CDSs), assignment of phenotype (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX>) or reassessment of putative function assignments
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> CDSs).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX> as modular entities
          Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX> have arisen through
          fusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Examples of such gene
          fusions are the multifunctional enzymes Aas
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-acylglycerophospho-ethanolamine</NUMEX> acyl transferase and
          acyl-acyl carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthetase</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1mU</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glucosamine-1-phosphate</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferase</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. We have chosen to deal with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as modular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> where a module is defined as
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> element that has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, carries a biological function and is presumed
          to have an independent evolutionary history [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modules</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> are individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          They can, however, also be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> where
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> have been joined by gene fusion, as is
          the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aas</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1mU</TIMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> types in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> such as transporters and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> also involve gene fusion events. The current
          modular assignments are based on analysis of protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Liang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
          There are at present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">287</TIMEX> compound genes identified in
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX>, each containing two

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> where each module encodes a distinct function.
          Enzymes, transporters and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> are all present in
          the list. The majority of modular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX>, contain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> belonging to different paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multimodular proteins</ENAMEX> appear to be a
          result of internal duplication (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) or a
          combination of gene fusion and duplication (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>).
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli chromosome</ENAMEX> is currently
          represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,401</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding 116 RNAs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,616</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein modules</ENAMEX>. Additional modules are expected to be
          identified upon analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Liang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Riley</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
          Examples are the bifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ThrA
          (aspartokinase I and homoserine dehydrogenase I) and MetL
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aspartokinase II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homoserine dehydrogenase II</ENAMEX>) where
          only the amino-terminal modules representing the kinase
          activities have been identified on the basis of their
          sequence similarity to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli unimodular</ENAMEX> aspartokinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LysC</ENAMEX>). Both the amino-terminal aspartokinase and the
          carboxy-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase activities of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThrA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MetL</ENAMEX> have been verified with biochemical and
          genetic tools [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">module</ENAMEX> representing the
          dehydrogenase activity has not been identified by
          matching internal paralogs as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> itself does not contain a
          unimodular sequence-similar dehydrogenase. 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however,
          does contain a unimodular sequence-similar homoserine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DhoM, SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P31116</ENAMEX>), which can be
          used in identifying the carboxy-terminal module. Thus, by
          detecting orthologous matches to parts of genes we will
          be able to identify additional multimodular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Current status
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3presents</ENAMEX> a summary of the gene products encoded
          in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> genome represented as
          modular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Half of the modules have been
          experimentally characterized. Enzymes are the largest
          gene product type, representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43.9%</NUMEX> of the
          characterized gene products and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.2%</NUMEX> of the total gene
          products. Other major gene product types are transporters
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. Among the remaining modules, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> have
          function predictions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> without a
          function assignment still constitute a significant
          portion of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of modules). A
          summary of the development of information on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene products</ENAMEX> over the past
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. It is evident that much
          knowledge has been gained since these analyses began in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 24</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        An updated version of the function assignments for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> has been
        presented using the genes identified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank</ENAMEX> U00096
        deposit. Alternative gene boundaries were produced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> genome annotation system also identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">candidate CDSs</ENAMEX> that may represent gene products not
        identified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U00096</ENAMEX> deposit. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ORFs</ENAMEX> with
        biological activity are likely to be abundant in the
        organism but await verification by biological data.
        Undoubtedly, the intergenic regions of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX>, as studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudd</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>] and Bachellier 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], are also important for
        the function and regulation of gene products.
        The percentage of identified chromosomal gene products
        without a function assignment is decreasing and is
        currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 7.4%</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> have no match in
        current sequence databases. This number will be further
        reduced with the release of the annotated genomes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shigella</ENAMEX> and other
        closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Preliminary data show that the
        number of unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> (ORFs encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> without
        sequence-similar matches) will be less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> after data
        on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhimurium genome</ENAMEX> is
        included (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.H.S.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        The function assignments presented here mainly represent
        the molecular functions of the gene products. With the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of microarray data, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> will also be
        characterized to a greater degree by the role they play in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> under specific conditions. We have recently
        developed a classification system for cellular functions of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> and have
        assigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> cellular role to some gene products
        where this is appropriate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. There is also a need for a
        more uniform way of describing both the molecular and
        cellular roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> among diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
        and this issue is currently being addressed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontology Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have presented a functional update of the gene
        products encoded by the genes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-12</ENAMEX> identified in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank Accession U00096</ENAMEX> deposit. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli proteins</ENAMEX> were treated as
        modular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> where a module is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, carries a biological function, and has an
        independent evolutionary history. The functional update was
        performed by manual evaluation of the data obtained from
        GenProtEC, BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DARWIN analyses</ENAMEX>, and MAGPIE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. A table containing the updated function
        assignments of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> is
        available as an additional data file online, and at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenProtEC</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. We believe these data will
        be valuable for analysis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> itself as well as for
        the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> encoded by other genomes.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Automated annotation
          
            MAGPIE ORF prediction
            A three-step approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> prediction was taken to
            prepare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX> project for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLIMMER 2.0</ENAMEX> with a
            minimum ORF length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> nucleotides was initially used
            to create the base set of predictions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Glimmer
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> was run with all default parameters, as recommended
            in the documentation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] and trained on the annotated
            set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> from the Blattner 
            et al. release of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
            Because GLIMMER selectively identifies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that match
            a statistical model of a gene for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>],
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLIMMER</ENAMEX> may miss genes that were laterally transferred
            or acquired more recently from other genomes. We
            therefore chose to combine the GLIMMER predictions with
            those of a syntactic tool encoded within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGPIE</ENAMEX>. This
            tool identifies stop codons and then 'backtracks' to
            the farthest upstream acceptable in-frame start codon
            and defines this as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. A non-redundant set
            of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLIMMER ORFs</ENAMEX> plus syntactic ORFs between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLIMMER</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> was generated. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> annotated by Blattner
            
            et al. that were not present in
            the non-redundant set were added to the MAGPIE
            project.
          
          
            BLAST analysis
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDSs</ENAMEX> were compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> nucleotide (nt)
            and non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (nr) databases using gapped
            BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX>-sequence motifs were identified by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSITE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. A search against the MAGPIE-predicted
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40</NUMEX> completed genomes, including the
            previously annotated 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> set, was also
            performed.
          
          
            Functional annotation
            Automated function annotation was provided using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX>. Description lines with low information content
            (for example, descriptions containing words such as
            "hypothetical" or "putative") were filtered out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERON</ENAMEX>
            then calculated word frequencies in the remaining
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptions</ENAMEX>, identified the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most common
            words, and selected the description of the
            highest-scoring sequence match (for homology
            comparisons) with one or more high-frequency words. The
            selected description became the automated annotation
            for the coding region.
          
        
        
          Manual annotation
          
            BLAST analysis
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> collected from GenBank
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession U00096</ENAMEX> were compared to the nr database using
            gapped BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DARWIN</ENAMEX> analysis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DARWIN</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX>) was used to detect
            sequence-similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> additional
            microbial genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Liang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Riley</ENAMEX>,
            unpublished data). In addition to orthologous matches,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralogous proteins</ENAMEX> of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> were generated on
            the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARWIN</ENAMEX> results. In our hands, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARWIN</ENAMEX>
            is particularly successful in identifying distant
            sequence similarities, a consequence no doubt of the
            application of multiple substitution matrices optimized
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and to each sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Functional annotation
            Functions were assigned to gene products on the
            basis of a manual evaluation of the results from the
            BLAST and DARWIN analyses. The automatic function
            prediction was also taken into account. In addition to
            incorporating recent experimental information, a
            substantial amount of human judgment was brought to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX>.
