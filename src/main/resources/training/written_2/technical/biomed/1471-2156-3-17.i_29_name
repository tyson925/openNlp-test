        Trafficking between the nuclear and cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> is mediated by nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complexes</ENAMEX> (NPCs) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . These large, proteinaceous structures are embedded
        in a nuclear envelope (NE) pore formed by fusion of the
        inner and outer nuclear membranes. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional
        structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> from both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> and budding yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
        characterized by distinct substructures that are arranged
        with an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold rotational symmetry [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> spoke-like
        structures form the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> core and are flanked on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring structures</ENAMEX>. Fibrils
        protrude from both the cytoplasmic and nuclear rings, with
        the nuclear fibrils gathered into a basket-like structure
        by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal ring</ENAMEX>. The global architectures of the yeast
        and vertebrate NPCs are highly similar, although there may
        be differences in the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring structures</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Genetic
        and biochemical studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> have identified ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (termed nucleoporins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX>) that comprise the
        estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~44</NUMEX> MDa structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Recent proteomic
        analysis has determined that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">NPCs</ENAMEX> are also
        comprised of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ; however, the
        overall size of the vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> is predicted to be
        larger [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Despite their size differences, yeast
        and vertebrate NPCs are responsible for identical transport
        reactions, and therefore, both structures are predicted to
        be functionally equivalent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly is likely to be a highly regulated process
        that coordinates membrane fusion with the coincident
        assembly of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nucleoporins</ENAMEX>. Biogenesis of NPCs
        takes place throughout the cell cycle in all cell types. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">novo</ENAMEX> assembly into intact NEs occurs during cell and
        nuclear growth to maintain a constant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        In cells undergoing an open mitosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> are also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-assembled with the formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The mechanisms controlling membrane fusion
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pore</ENAMEX> formation and the steps for assembly of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct NPC</ENAMEX> substructures have not been fully elucidated.
        Understanding the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis will
        be a critical step in determining the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        function.
        Current models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> are based on a
        combination of in vivo and in vitro studies. Experiments
        using immuno-fluorescence in vertebrate cells are beginning
        to order the recruitment and timing of incorporation of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleoporins</ENAMEX> during post-mitotic re-assembly [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Additionally, in vitro assembly studies
        with 
        Xenopus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> or mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extracts
        have revealed several intermediates in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and
        demonstrated a requirement for an intact double nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> prior to post-mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        . The modular nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure has also
        suggested that subcomplexes of discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nups</ENAMEX> may initially
        form and provide building blocks for biogenesis. In fact,
        Hurt and coworkers have recently demonstrated the in vitro
        assembly of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nup</ENAMEX> subcomplex from entirely recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Given the structural and functional
        similarities between vertebrate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast NPCs</ENAMEX> and the
        insertion of both into a pre-existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEs</ENAMEX>, it is likely
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis occurs via a similar mechanism in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        We and others have focused on genetic analysis in the
        budding yeast 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae to understand the
        mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis. This approach has mostly
        involved reverse genetics wherein mutations in a gene
        encoding a known nucleoporin are evaluated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        structural and functional changes, and several mutants that
        induce massive morphological perturbations have been
        characterized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . However, the advent of
        green fluorescence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP)-based technology has
        recently allowed forward genetic strategies. Using
        GFP-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX>, we designed live cell assays to monitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC dynamics</ENAMEX> and assembly rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, to
        isolate factors required for proper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and
        localization, we developed a novel genetic screening
        strategy. The approach is based on the ability to express
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional GFP</ENAMEX>-nucleoporin fusions, and the assumption that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly/mislocalization mutants expressing a
        GFP-nucleoporin will have distinct fluorescence properties
        as compared to wild type cells. Our previous studies used
        fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate mutants and
        identified a 
        nup57 mutant with diminished
        incorporation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Nup49p</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . As
        Nup57p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup49p</ENAMEX> directly interact in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] , this provided a powerful strategy for pinpointing
        nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> interaction requirements. We have now
        extended this analysis and employed classic temperature
        sensitive mutant collection with a strain expressing
        multiple GFP-tagged nucleoporins. This modified approach
        was designed to isolate mutants that affect global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. We report here the complete mutant screen
        identifying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> individual mutants that subdivide into at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Further analysis of mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX> has revealed potential mechanisms for both direct
        and indirect perturbation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and localization,
        and indicates that this process requires multiple
        factors

          Rationale for a genetic screen to identify
          temperature sensitive mutants that perturb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly
          and localization
          Work in our previous studies suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GFP</ENAMEX>-based
          screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (designated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">npa</ENAMEX> ) was a powerful approach. This
          strategy was based on the ability to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> express
          GFP-nucleoporin fusions, and the assumption that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> 
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ssembly/mislocalization</ENAMEX>
          mutants expressing a GFP-nucleoporin would have distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In wild type yeast
          cells, fluorescence microscopy localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> appears as punctate staining of virtually the
          entire nuclear rim circumference (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Mutants
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Nup</ENAMEX> localization could include cells with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> clusters in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> subregions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) mislocalization of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nup</ENAMEX> or aggregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> subcomplexes to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> or nucleus (due to either a block in new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> or increased instability of existing NPCs), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          mislocalization of the GFP-Nup due to indirect
          perturbation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> membrane, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX>) decreased
          GFP-Nup incorporation followed by turnover resulting in
          cells with diminished total fluorescence. Given the lack
          of knowledge about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and
          localization, we aimed to bias the genetic strategy
          towards those with global assembly defects. We predicted
          that factors required for total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis would be
          essential, as functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> are absolutely required for
          nuclear transport. Thus, a primary modification of our
          original strategy was to generate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of temperature
          sensitive (ts) mutants from a parental strain expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nup</ENAMEX>(s). Examining the direct GFP-Nup fluorescence of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> would isolate potential 
          npa <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we sought to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preferentially</ENAMEX> isolate mutants that decrease overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          number versus inhibiting the incorporation of the single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nup</ENAMEX>. We predicted that co-expression of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> that localize to distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> substructures
          would allow identification of mutants with global
          defects.
          For such a screen, haploid strains expressing
          chromosomally integrated GFP fusions to both 
          NIC96 and 
          NUP170 were generated (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). 
          NIC96 is an essential nucleoporin
          and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of multiple biochemically distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcomplexes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . 
          NUP170 , while not essential, is
          physically and genetically linked to a distinct subset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoporins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . The rationale for using 
          NIC96 and 
          NUP170 are several-fold. Nic96p and
          Nup170p are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleoporins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 31</NUMEX>
          ] , the characterized 
          nic96 and 
          nup170 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> do not result in
          gross morphological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> perturbations (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> clusters,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> herniations, or membrane sealing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 31 35</NUMEX> ]
          , and in previous studies GFP-epitope tagging of Nic96p
          or Nup170p did not inhibit function [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , our
          unpublished observations]. Finally, the encoded proteins
          are associated with distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> subcomplexes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and
          we speculated that true mislocalization mutants would
          require disruption of both sets of subcomplexes and more
          likely reflect defects in global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>.
          In the doubly tagged 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-nic96 nup170-GFP</ENAMEX> strains, both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Nic96</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup170p-GFP</ENAMEX> were targeted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and
          showed punctate rim-staining characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the combination of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein fusions</ENAMEX> in a haploid strain resulted in
          a ts phenotype at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37°</NUMEX>. The ts phenotype was not, however,
          accompanied by mislocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> after growth
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37°</NUMEX>. The strain was viable at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> and
          doubling times were similar to wild type cells at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX>. We
          predicted this sensitized background might further bias
          the screen toward mutations that perturb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          structure.
        
        
          Isolation of npamutants
          Wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-nic96 nup170-GFP</ENAMEX> haploid
          strains were mutagenized to generate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of ts mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strains</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). To
          identify mutants from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, individual ts strains
          were visually screened for GFP-Nup localization by
          fluorescence microscopy after shifting cultures to the
          non-permissive temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">34°</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-6 hours</TIMEX>. A total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> individual 
          npa <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were identified in
          which the GFP-Nup signal was altered. The mutant
          phenotypes were largely penetrant with all cells from a
          mutant strain responding identically. None of the cells
          in a mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had retained a completely normal
          appearance when assayed. Although most mutants had
          relatively normal growth rates at the permissive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, many showed signs of cell stress as
          indicated by large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and vacuole size (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, DIC
          panels). While our previous screen identified mutants
          with either a diminished GFP signal (dim mutants) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          clusters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , very few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> isolated in
          this screen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/121</NUMEX>) showed a temperature dependent
          decrease in fluorescence intensity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, compare
          panels A and C to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>). Instead, most mutants lost
          the exclusive, punctate nuclear rim localization, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> were present in areas distinct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and
          often in discrete foci (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, panels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). The
          majority showed wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP</ENAMEX> localization at the
          permissive growth temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">23°</ENAMEX>); however some did
          show a weak mislocalization phenotype at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX> that was
          significantly enhanced when the cells were shifted to
          growth at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34°</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, panels E and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Intriguingly,</ENAMEX>
          some of the mutants also had an apparent increase in GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, panel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>). We speculate that this is
          due to changes in nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> interactions such as
          those observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Nup82p</ENAMEX> in a 
          nup57 mutant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          To determine the number of independent mutant genes
          isolated, complementation analysis of the ts phenotype
          was performed. Based on pairwise crosses of mutants with
          opposite mating type, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37/121</NUMEX>) of the
          mutants were initially catalogued into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different
          complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">84/121</NUMEX>) of the mutants could not be assigned
          to a complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Subsequent backcrossing and
          isolation of opposite mating type strains for the some of
          the mutants allowed definition of an additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. However, the majority of the
          mutants were apparently unique with only single mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> isolated. This suggested that the screen was not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturating</ENAMEX>. Overall, the large number of independent 
          npa mutants (potentially <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>) was
          surprising and suggested that a number of distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and localization.
        
        
          Nup localization analysis in npastrains
          To investigate the effects on NPCs more directly, we
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the largest independent
          complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for analysis. The mutants
          displaying the strongest GFP-Nup mislocalization
          phenotypes were backcrossed. In each case, the GFP-Nup
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phenotype segregated 2:2</ENAMEX> and was genetically linked to
          the ts phenotype indicating a single mutation was
          responsible for both. Interestingly, mutant alleles in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> showed a similar
          pattern of GFP-Nup mislocalization. To investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          structure more closely in 
          npa1-1 and 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mutants, logarithmically
          growing cultures were shifted to the non-permissive
          temperature and assayed for GFP-Nup localization by
          direct fluorescence microscopy at various times after the
          shift. The parental strain, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY2089</TIMEX>, maintained wild-type
          nuclear rim localization during growth at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34°</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          panels A-D). In contrast, both mutants showed a
          temperature dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mislocalization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Nic96</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and
          Nup170p-GFP over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hour</TIMEX> time course (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Both
          
          npa1-1 and 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells ceased growing after
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-4 hours</TIMEX> at the non-permissive temperature. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
          time they completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. Previous
          studies of 
          nic96 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> have shown that cells
          may undergo <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3</TIMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> with no apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. Thus, the more rapid onset of growth arrest in 
          npa1 and 
          npa2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> suggested that the ts
          phenotype was not caused exclusively by a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          number and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport capacity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 35</NUMEX>
          ] and may be due to other cellular effects. Other members
          of the 
          npa1 and 
          npa2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complementation groups</ENAMEX> showed
          similar phenotypes (data not shown). In addition, Western
          analysis showed no decrease in GFP-Nup <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in
          arrested 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> protein
          stability was not affected (data not shown).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of our original predictions was that labeling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiple Nups</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> would identify mutants with
          defects in the formation of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure. To
          determine if additional, non-GFP tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nups</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislocalized</ENAMEX> in these cells, we used indirect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> (IF) microscopy with antibodies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup116p</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pom152p</TIMEX>. Like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Nic96</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup170p-GFP</ENAMEX>, the localization of Nup116p
          and Pom152p changed from a punctate, nuclear rim staining
          to cytoplasmic foci when shifted to the non-permissive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Ultrastructural analysis of mutants by thin section
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopy
          Thin-section electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted
          to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>. After
          staining with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate, NPCs
          in wild-type/parental cells were represented by electron
          dense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> spanning the pore (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In 
          npa1-1 and 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells, several distinct
          perturbations were noted. At the permissive temperature, 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells showed nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invaginations</ENAMEX>. In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4E</TIMEX>, a single cell cross-section
          showed multiple layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NE</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPCs</ENAMEX>. However,
          the GFP-Nup localization appeared normal in these cells
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23°</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). After shifting to the non-permissive
          temperature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>, there was a dramatic
          change in structural morphology in both 
          npa1-1 and 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mutants. Most striking was
          the overproliferation of outer nuclear/endoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) membranes. This proliferation was often
          observed originating from the nucleus and resulted in a
          regular honeycomb-like array of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~100</NUMEX> nm diameter tubules
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand 4F</ENAMEX>). Although it was not always possible to
          definitively identify a nucleus in each section (Figure
          4F, for example), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> were present in the envelope
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposed</ENAMEX> to the nucleus despite the expanded membranes
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand 4D</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> dense structures resembling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> were also embedded in membranes distinct from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleus/NE</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4F</NUMEX>). This most likely corresponded
          with the cytoplasmic foci observed by fluorescence. We
          did not observe any evidence of cytoplasmic annulate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamellae</ENAMEX> formation, although nuclear invaginations
          sometimes resulted in juxtaposed double membranes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing NPCs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4F</NUMEX>). There were also no
          structures resembling the intra-nuclear annulate lamellae
          observed in some nup mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 36</NUMEX> ] . Samples analyzed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEM</ENAMEX> over a time course after shift to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> showed that
          the membrane proliferation paralleled the GFP-Nup
          mislocalization seen by fluorescence microscopy (data not
          shown). This further suggested that the GFP-Nup
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislocalization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEM</ENAMEX> membrane proliferation were the
          consequence of the same process.
        
        
          Identification of mutants
          To identify the mutated genes, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> genomic library
          was screened for complementation of the recessive ts
          phenotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> mutants. Multiple genomic
          inserts capable of rescuing the ts growth defect were
          isolated for each strain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> and comparison to
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saccharomyces Genome Database</ENAMEX>
          identified a minimal overlapping region on chromosome XII
          for the 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> complementing plasmids, and
          on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX> in the 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> complementing plasmids. Both
          regions contained multiple open reading frames; however,
          we focused immediately on a single gene for each mutant, 
          SEC13 for 
          npa2-1 and 
          SEC23 for 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . 
          SEC13 was first identified in a
          screen for secretory mutants and encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the
          COPII coat, which is required for vesicle budding from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] . More recently, it has been shown
          that a fraction of the total cellular Sec13p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-fractionates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> in a distinct subcomplex with
          Nup84p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup85p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup120p</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup145Cp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Seh1p</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . 
          SEC23 was also identified in a
          screen for secretory mutants, and it, too, is a component
          of the COPII coat [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-purification of
          Sec23p with intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> has not been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ;
          however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sec23p</TIMEX> was recently isolated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup42p</TIMEX> and
          Nup116p affinity chromatography strategies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
          Expression constructs containing only 
          SEC13 or 
          SEC23 were transformed into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mutant strains</ENAMEX> and assayed for their ability to rescue
          growth at the non-permissive temperature. Both minimal
          constructs only restored growth of their respective
          strain (data not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the GFP-Nup
          localization phenotype was also complemented (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The ability of 
          SEC13 and 
          SEC23 to complement the mutants
          strongly suggested that mutations in these genes were
          responsible for the observed phenotypes. However, it was
          still a formal possibility that the overexpression of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from a low copy plasmid was sufficient for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX>. To eliminate this possibility, genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from each of the mutants was used as a template in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions to generate expression plasmids (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). Sequencing of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa2-1/sec13</ENAMEX> allele identified a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">single G</ENAMEX> to A transition that changed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gly</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> at
          position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. To test if this mutation was
          necessary and sufficient for the observed phenotype, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> was transformed into the original 
          npa2-1 mutant and a 
          sec13Δ covered by p 
          SEC13 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">URA3</TIMEX> . Expression of p 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sec13-G176R</ENAMEX> complemented the
          otherwise lethal 
          sec13Δ at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX>; however, its
          expression was not sufficient to restore growth at the
          non-permissive temperature to either the isolated 
          npa2-1 mutant or 
          sec13Δ (data not shown). DNA
          sequencing analysis showed that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-1/sec23 mutant</ENAMEX> was identical
          to the well-characterized 
          sec23-1 ( 
          S383L ) mutant allele [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          The accumulation of non-secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in mutants
          defective in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER to Golgi</ENAMEX> transport leads to proliferation
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 44</NUMEX> ] . The membrane proliferation seen by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEM</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-1/sec23</ENAMEX> and 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/sec13</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and
          the coincident mislocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and</ENAMEX> data
          not shown) prompted us to test if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> were accumulating
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>. Logarithmically growing cultures of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-1/sec23</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa2-1/sec13</ENAMEX> were shifted to the
          non-permissive temperature as before and then fixed and
          processed for IF with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> against Kar2p
          to visualize the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . The monoclonal antibody
          mAb414, which recognizes a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> distinct from
          Nic96p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup170p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , was also used because the GFP
          fluorescence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> was more sensitive to
          fixation when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> were mislocalized than when
          they remained at the nuclear rim (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>). In 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/sec13</NUMEX> cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> became
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">punctate</ENAMEX> and formed discrete foci at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). In contrast, 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/sec23</NUMEX> cells rapidly
          accumulate an interconnected <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6B</NUMEX>).
          Expansion and changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> morphology were observed as
          early as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> after the temperature shift, and
          continued to increase in magnitude over the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four hour</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Although the localization
          patterns at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late time</TIMEX> points after temperature shifting
          were similar, the localizations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ER protein</ENAMEX> Kar2p
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> were not overlapping.
        
        
          Testing other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPII</ENAMEX> coat and secretory pathway
          components for npagroups
          The screen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly/mislocalization mutants
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are part of the COPII coat, 
          SEC13 and 
          SEC23 . To test if other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the COPII coat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> were isolated in the screen,
          conditional alleles in 
          SEC16 , 
          SEC24 , 
          SEC31 , 
          SAR1 , and 
          SEC12 were kindly provided by other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, and tested directly for their effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> localization. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encode proteins</ENAMEX>,
          which along with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sec13p and Sec23p</TIMEX>, form the coat while
          Sec12p is required to recruit and activate Sar1p on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> for coat assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Complementation analysis
          between these mutants and those isolated in the screen
          failed to identify any of these. However, when the genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-tagged Nups</ENAMEX> were crossed into these mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backgrounds</ENAMEX>, all displayed GFP-Nup mislocalization under
          non-permissive conditions (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7and</ENAMEX> data not shown).
          The pattern of mislocalization in each case was similar
          to that observed in the isolated 
          sec13 and 
          sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>.
          Our continued efforts focused on cloning additional 
          npa mutants by library
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX>. This identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more genes required
          for trafficking between the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER and Golgi</ENAMEX>. A genomic
          fragment containing 
          BET3 complemented the ts phenotype
          of 
          npa10 , and 
          npa3-1 was rescued by a library
          plasmid only when it contained full length 
          SEC27 (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>).
          Bet3p is part of a complex that binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COPII</ENAMEX> derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> and is required for vesicle targeting [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ]
          . Sec27p is a component of the COPI coat and required for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> transport [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . Like 
          SEC23 and 
          SEC13 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, others have reported
          that mutants in 
          BET3 and 
          SEC27 result in an
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 51</NUMEX> ] .
          To determine if the overlap between 
          npa mutants and the secretory
          pathway was restricted to gene products affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>,
          the 
          sec6-4 mutant perturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> to
          plasma membrane transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] was crossed into 
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-nic96 nup170-GFP</ENAMEX> strain.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX>, the same conditions that cause
          GFP-Nup mislocalization in the other assayed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutants, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> in 
          sec6-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> remained localized to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> in the characteristic, punctate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> rim pattern
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Novel npagroups lack secretion defects
          The initial isolation of multiple 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutants from our screen that
          was designed to isolate mutants in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> raised the question of whether any of the
          mutants were specific for defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
          assembly/structure. To pinpoint mutants that lacked
          secretion defects, we assayed each mutant from the
          collection for the ability to secrete the enzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invertase</ENAMEX> in response to low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Logarithmically
          growing cells were transferred to low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> media and
          incubated at the non-permissive temperature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 hours</TIMEX>. When invertase activity from individual
          mutants was normalized to the activity of the parental
          strains, a range of relative activities were observed
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). With the exception of 
          npa1-3 and 
          npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> , the 
          sec23 ( 
          npa1 ), 
          sec13 ( 
          npa2 ), and 
          bet3 ( 
          npa10 ) mutants had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX>
          of wild-type invertase activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8A</NUMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">npa3/sec27</ENAMEX> mutants displayed near
          wild-type invertase activity indicating that forward
          trafficking through the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> was not significantly
          disrupted. This is consistent with secretion results
          reported for other 
          sec27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 53</NUMEX> ] . It is
          important to note that despite the lack of secretion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defect</ENAMEX>, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-3/sec23</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-7/sec23</ENAMEX> , and 

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa3-1/sec27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> each had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> structure similar to those of 
          npa1-1 and 
          npa2-1 (data not shown). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-3/sec23</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-7/sec23</ENAMEX> mutants may be unique
          alleles that preferentially affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly versus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX>. For the unidentified, potentially novel,
          mutants, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">56/96</NUMEX>) had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> of
          wild-type invertase activity. This suggests secretion may
          be impaired in these mutants. Alternatively, these
          mutants may have defects along the pathway leading to
          transcriptional up-regulation of invertase ( 
          SUC2 ) in response to low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> ] . Most importantly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25/96</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> had
          at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> or greater of wild-type activity (Figure
          8B). The lack of secretion defects in some of the mutants
          indicates that non-nucleoporins are being trafficked
          properly when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> are mislocalized.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have used a genetic strategy to identify factors
        required for proper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis. By creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of
        ts mutants in a doubly tagged 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-nic96 nup170-GFP</ENAMEX> S.
        cerevisiae strain and individually screening the
        mutants at the non-permissive temperature, we identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> ts <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mutant strains</ENAMEX> which fail to correctly localize the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NE</ENAMEX> rim. In addition to the
        mislocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Nic96</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup170p-GFP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup116p</TIMEX>,
        Pom152p and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nups</ENAMEX> recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mAb414</TIMEX> were also perturbed
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> characterized to date. These <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nups</ENAMEX> are
        localized throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and indicate a
        global defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly/structure. Complementation
        analysis indicated the mutants were all recessive and fell
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In comparison to our previous
        genetic screen with a strain expressing only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Nup49p</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] , these results suggest that increasing the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> integrity effectively
        increases the likelihood of obtaining a panel of mutants
        defective in global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly, stability, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>.
        Based on the GFP-Nup localization and genetic analysis,
        a range of mutant phenotypes and complementation groups
        were catalogued. Several of the complementation groups
        contained multiple independent alleles ( 
        npa1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ), and within a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the strengths of the defects were
        varied. However, there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> allele for the majority
        of the complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, representing potentially 
        npa10-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>. This suggests that the
        mutagenesis was not saturating, and it is likely that
        mutations in additional genes that function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biogenesis</ENAMEX> would be isolated by repeated application of
        this screening strategy. In addition, the large number of
        potential total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> may reflect roles for many factors
        in proper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NE/</ENAMEX>nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis. We have
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by complementation-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX>. The results thus far indicate the screen is
        specifically enriched for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE/NPC</ENAMEX> specific effects versus
        nonspecific mutants that may affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nup</ENAMEX> protein
        stability or levels (polymerases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>/translation
        factors, chaperones) (this report and unpublished results).
        The ts defects in individual 
        npa mutants may represent failures in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>, changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> localization, or perturbations in
        the stability of pre-existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX>.
        Here we focused on characterizing the largest
        complementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest were allelic with 
        SEC23 and 
        SEC13 , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding</ENAMEX> known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vesicular</ENAMEX> trafficking between the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and Golgi
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The GFP-Nup mislocalization defects in the 
        sec23 ( 
        npa1 ) and 
        sec13 ( 
        npa2 ) mutants correlated with
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER membrane perturbations</ENAMEX>. We also identified 
        npa3 as 
        sec27 and 
        npa10 as 
        bet3 . Taken together, the recovery
        of a large number of 
        npa mutants that encode components of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-Golgi secretory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> indicate that this is a "hot
        spot" for mutations that cause perturbations in GFP-Nup
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>.
        Extensive and elegant studies have documented distinct
        changes in membrane morphology in mutants with arrest
        points in the secretory pathway. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> morphological
        classes include 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutants with extended networks of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER membrane</ENAMEX>, those with accumulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgi</ENAMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accumulated</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80-100</NUMEX> nm secretory vesicles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The
        morphological perturbations directly correlate with
        distinct secretory pathway blocks: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-Golgi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intra-Golgi</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golgi</ENAMEX>-plasma membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . A recent study in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> has also shown that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> can affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and cell
        cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . In addition to 
        sec13 , our screen also identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> alleles of 
        SEC23 , 
        SEC27 and 
        BET3 . The mislocalization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> in 
        sec13 and 
        sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> was coincident with the
        formation of extensive honeycomb networks of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, we found by direct testing that mutant
        alleles corresponding to the genes for all known COPII coat
        components resulted in altered GFP-Nup localization. Based
        on reports from others, all of these mutants have an
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 44 49 51 56 57 58</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> ] . However, over the same time course, our direct
        testing of one 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutant with a defect in a later
        secretion step did not show perturbations (e.g. the 
        sec6-4 mutant that accumulates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] did not result in GFP-Nup
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislocalization</ENAMEX>). Additionally, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutants with no apparent defect
        in invertase secretion ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-3/sec23</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa1-7/sec23</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">npa3-1/sec27</ENAMEX> ) had both perturbations
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nup</ENAMEX> localization. This suggests that
        mutants which disrupt the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> will affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nup</ENAMEX> localization
        and likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> assembly/structure.
        Connections between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sec13p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> function have been
        previously reported. A fraction of the total cellular
        Sec13p is isolated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> subcomplex containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Nup84p</ENAMEX>,
        Nup85p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup120p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup145p-C</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seh1p</TIMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sec13</NUMEX>-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . Hurt and coworkers have also reported
        that ts 
        sec13 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> show enhanced growth
        defects when combined with a 
        nup85Δ mutant, and result in the
        mislocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Nup49p</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> clusters and
        cytoplasmic foci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . This correlates with our
        observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Nic96</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nup170p-GFP</ENAMEX> in our 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sec13/npa2 mutant.</ENAMEX> However, we did
        not observe clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">herniated NPCs</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sec13-G176R/npa2-1</ENAMEX> cells suggesting
        the 
        sec13-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> and 
        sec13-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> alleles in the Hurt study
        are distinct [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Precisely how Sec13p influences <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        structure/function remains to be elucidated.
        The phenotypes observed in 
        sec13 and 
        sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> might indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPII</ENAMEX> vesicles and/or a vesicular biogenesis step is
        required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> formation; however, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        indirect mechanisms by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may be changed
        in these mutants. Blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>/Golgi pathway could
        titrate away the pool of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sec13p</TIMEX> that is found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>.
        Alternatively, the extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> proliferations that result
        are connected to the outer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and could prevent proper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. Given that the formation of the extensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the 
        sec13 and 
        sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> was coincident with the
        GFP-Nup mislocalization, we favor one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> indirect
        models. We feel this conclusion is also supported by our
        observation that the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> was altered
        in mutants for all COPII coat components. However, not all
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPII</ENAMEX> components co-fractionate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 42</NUMEX> ]
        . Thus, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPII</ENAMEX> components that perturb GFP-Nup
        localization that do not co-fractionate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPCs</ENAMEX>. We
        conclude there is no absolute correlation between
        localization of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPII</ENAMEX> component at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> and its
        ability to disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> structure/function. Instead, it is
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> mutants that alter <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> structure
        that effect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nup</ENAMEX> localization.
        The defects that we have observed in GFP-Nup
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> in various 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are distinct from recent
        reports characterizing a novel arrest of secretion response
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tartakoff</ENAMEX> and
        coworkers have proposed that mutants with a secretory block
        show altered nuclear transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capacities</ENAMEX>, changes in the
        nuclear localization of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and potential
        perturbations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> composition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] . In our 
        sec13 and 
        sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, we do not believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> has changed but rather that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> localization
        has been altered by formation of extended <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Taken together, the work to date supports a framework
        wherein a network of in vivo interactions mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        biogenesis, structural integrity, and proper localization
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>. A complete understanding of the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX>
        in nuclear transport will require the identification of all
        the genes that regulate its assembly, stability, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. Although the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">npa/sec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> characterized here
        are due to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER distortions</ENAMEX>, we predict that further analysis
        of the other 
        npa mutants and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GFP</ENAMEX>-based genetic
        strategies will significantly contribute to the effort of
        identifying factors required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPC</ENAMEX> biogenesis.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Yeast Strains
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used in this study are listed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. General yeast manipulations were conducted by
          standard methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] with transformations by the
          lithium acetate method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . All strains were grown at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> extract, peptone, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>) unless
          otherwise noted. The sequence encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> was fused in
          frame to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the 
          NUP170 open reading frame using the
          method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baudin et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . To create a template for
          the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BamHI</ENAMEX> fragment
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S65T F64L</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] was first cloned into pRS316 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
          ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment for integration was generated by PCR
          using the following oligonucleotides: Nup170G
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GATCCAATTGAAAAGTACGTTAAGAACAGCGGCAATAATTTGGGGATTTGTTTCTACAAAGAAGCTGCGATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTT-3</ENAMEX>')
          and Nup170V
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTACTTACAGATTACGATCTGTTCAATGCATCAGAAATAGGAAGAAATTCAAAGCGGCATCAGAGCAGATTGT-3</ENAMEX>').
          The resulting fragment was gel purified and transformed
          into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY519</TIMEX>. Correct chromosomal integration was

          crossing to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YCH128</TIMEX>. GFP-tagged strains of other known
          mutants were made by crossing to either parental strain
          SWY2089 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY2090</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Null (Δ</ENAMEX>) deletion strains of

          Plasmids
          Plasmids with wild type 
          SEC13 were generated with the
          following oligonucleotides (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' oligo <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sec13N5</TIMEX> with

          isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> plasmid as template. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was
          digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XbaI</ENAMEX> and cloned into the SacI/XbaI
          sites of both pRS315 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pSW1264</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS316</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pSW1268</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
          ] . Plasmids with wild type

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SEC23/URA3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pSW1269</NUMEX>). Sequence for
          the mutant 
          sec13 and 
          sec23 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were cloned using the
          same oligonucleotide pairs with genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from SWY2324
          or SWY2325, serving as template. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> independent PCR
          trials were completed for each mutant allele and cloned
          into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pRS315</TIMEX> vector [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Clones from each were
          obtained and both strands sequenced.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutagenesis</ENAMEX> and screening for mutants
          Mutagenesis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY2089 and SWY2090</TIMEX> with ethylmethane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfonate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS; Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) was performed as
          described with the following modifications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] .
          First, cells were mutagenized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 75</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>,
          followed by plating a fraction of the culture to
          determine cell viability at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX>. The remaining cells were
          stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4°</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> until the viability
          could be analyzed. The remaining mutagenized cell
          cultures were then plated to obtain ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          from each strain. To achieve this number, we assumed that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX> of the cells died during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4°</NUMEX> storage.
          Temperature sensitive mutants were isolated by replica
          plating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> to both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23° and 34°</TIMEX>, and screening for
          those that failed to grow at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX>. To screen for GFP-Nup
          localization, temperature sensitive strains were
          inoculated individually in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml liquid YPD cultures and
          grown at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-16 hours</TIMEX> before shifting to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-6 hours</TIMEX>. The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were in
          logarithmic growth phase at the time of the temperature
          shift. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> localization was determined by direct
          fluorescence microscopy of unfixed cells. Fluorescence
          screening was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional times on those with
          an altered GFP pattern to confirm the phenotype.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant</ENAMEX> complementation analysis
          Complementation analysis of the temperature sensitive
          phenotypes was performed by crossing all the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAT</ENAMEX> 
          
            a 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mutant strains</ENAMEX> to all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">MATα mutant strains</ENAMEX> and selecting
          for diploids on media lacking lysine and tryptophan.
          Diploids were then replica plated back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPD</ENAMEX> and assayed
          for growth at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX>. For direct testing, temperature
          sensitive mutants in genes involved in vesicular budding
          from the endoplasmic reticulum were obtained from others
          and crossed to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> isolated in the screen.
          Diploids were selected on appropriate minimal media, and
          then assayed for growth at the non-permissive temperature
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37°</NUMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Nups</ENAMEX> did not cause a temperature
          sensitive phenotype in heterozygous diploids).
          Additionally, the 
          sar1Δ crosses were grown on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          to repress the plasmid borne copy of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-SAR1</ENAMEX> .
        
        
          Microscopy
          Live cell fluorescence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIC</ENAMEX> microscopy was
          performed on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BX50</ENAMEX> microscope using an UPlan
          100X<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1.3</NUMEX> objective. Cells for photography were grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> lacking histidine, as the 
          HIS3 linked GFP-tag of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-nic96</ENAMEX> showed some instability
          in the 
          nup170-GFP background. Images were
          captured using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dage-MTI CCD-300-RC</ENAMEX> camera with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
          Image <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.61</NUMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photometrics CoolSnap HQ</ENAMEX> camera with
          MetaVue software. Indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">immuno-fluorescence</ENAMEX> was
          performed as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Rabbit
          anti-Kar2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] were used at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> and detected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Red Goat</ENAMEX>-anti-Rabbit
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mAb414</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] and
          anti<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Pom152</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monoclonal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mAb118C3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] were detected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> Goat-anti-mouse secondary. Thin section electron
          microscopy was conducted according to [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Molecular cloning
          Selected mutants were backcrossed until the
          temperature sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenotype segregated 2</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> and was
          shown to be linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> mislocalization phenotype.
          Identification of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was accomplished by
          complementation of the temperature sensitive phenotype.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SWY2324</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY2325</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SWY2332</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SWY2333</NUMEX> strains were
          transformed with a 
          LEU2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/CEN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> genomic library
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>). Transformants were grown for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23°</NUMEX> and then shifted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX>. Multiple
          overlapping inserts capable of rescuing the temperature
          sensitive growth defect were isolated for each strain.
          Sequencing of the insert ends and comparison to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae Genome Database</ENAMEX>
          identified a region on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX> for 
          npa1-1 and 
          npa1-2 and chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XII</ENAMEX> for 
          npa2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Plasmids expressing only 
          SEC23 or 
          SEC13 were used to test if these
          genes were necessary and sufficient for rescuing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. Library inserts rescuing 
          npa3-1 contained a region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome VII</ENAMEX> encompassing 
          SEC27. A partial deletion of 
          SEC27 from one of the inserts
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pSW1386</NUMEX>) was used to confirm that 
          SEC27 was responsible for rescue of
          the growth defect. The temperature sensitive growth
          defect of 
          npa10 was rescued by a region on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome XI</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YKR064W</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
          MET1 . The only essential gene in
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is 
          BET3 .
        
        
          Invertase Assays
          Mutants were grown at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23° overnight</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 ml YPD</TIMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">logarithmic</ENAMEX> phase. The equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture was washed into YP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and incubated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34°</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 hours</TIMEX>. The incubation was ended by addition of an
          equal volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azide</ENAMEX>. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were
          washed once with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azide</ENAMEX> then resuspended in
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">800 μl</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azide</ENAMEX>. Assays of invertase
          activity were performed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 μl</NUMEX> of each sample
          according to [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 71</NUMEX> ] . The activity of each mutant was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the activity of the parental strain assayed
          at the same time.
