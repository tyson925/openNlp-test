        During the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multicellular organisms</ENAMEX>,
        complexity builds sequentially in discrete steps as cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferate</ENAMEX> and their descendants choose between
        alternative developmental fates. Much of our understanding
        of these processes in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has come from mutants that
        have developmental defects. There are many examples. For
        instance, mutations in the homeodomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein genes</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antennapedia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bithorax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> provide evidence for
        the role of transcription factors in making developmental
        decisions. Flies with gain-of-function mutations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antennapedia</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> ) gene cannot grow normal
        antennae, but instead make extra legs with their antennal
        cells. Conversely, loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> function causes
        transformation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> leg to antenna-like structures
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Another example is the 
        glass gene, which encodes a
        zinc-finger transcription factor that is expressed in many
        of the cell types in the eye imaginal disc and is required
        for photoreceptor development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The common functions of
        these and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in regulating gene expression
        suggest that developmental fates are manifested in part in
        the transcripts that different cell types produce.
        Although the number of 
        Drosophila mutants with interesting
        developmental phenotypes is large, we cannot assume that
        the genetic screens that have been carried out identified
        all the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Many 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been refractory
        to genetic analysis, either because they are duplicated and
        may code for redundant functions, or because they have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> phenotypes that are difficult to recognize. In
        addition, genetic and biochemical approaches have yielded
        few downstream genes that the key transcription factors
        regulate. The recent release of the 
        Drosophila genome sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and
        the demonstration that cDNA microarrays can be used to
        catalog the transcriptome of both unicellular and
        multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>] opens up a new approach.
        Hybridization of mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> can
        potentially identify the differences in gene activity that
        define every developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Thus, transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and their downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> can be identified
        simultaneously.
        The 
        Drosophila larva contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
        developmentally distinct sets of organs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> set comprises
        the vital organs of the larva - the epidermis and
        musculature, the central and peripheral nervous systems,
        and the organs of the digestive tract. Most of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> will be destroyed at metamorphosis and will be
        replaced by imaginal (adult) cells. The imaginal precursor
        cells have no functional role in the larva. For some adult
        structures such as the eyes, antennae, legs, wings,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">halteres</ENAMEX> and genitalia, the imaginal precursors are
        sequestered as physically distinct primordia - the imaginal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discs</ENAMEX>. The different discs are determined as to disc type,
        but do not differentiate until the late larval and
        subsequent pupal stages when they form the adult
        structures. The distinct developmental phases of the
        imaginal discs, their easy accessibility, along with the
        numerous advantages of 
        Drosophila as a model genetic and
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> make imaginal disc development an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> system to explore the feasibility and usefulness of
        such an analysis at a genomic scale.
        The principal technical difficulty such a study must
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surmount</ENAMEX> is that the quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> needed for efficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to microarrays is large relative to the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> contained in a single 
        Drosophila imaginal disc.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 Î</TIMEX>¼g poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is required to make a
        probe, but a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc has only about
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-4 ng</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> discs would need
        to be dissected for each set of experiments. In previous
        reports of expression profiling, 
        Drosophila embryos, adult flies and
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>, and collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were pooled after
        carefully timing or otherwise selecting individual animals
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 14, 18, 20</TIMEX>]. However, any scheme to stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is
        inherently inexact. In addition, parameters such as genetic
        variability, nutritional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, pathogen exposure and
        effects of the isolation procedure cannot be easily
        controlled or measured. Pools of animals therefore yield
        only an average of their varied inputs, and depending on
        the extent of variability, critical differences between
        samples may be submerged. Furthermore, the level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> is relatively low when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA preparations</ENAMEX> from
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are used. For many biological questions, it
        is necessary to detect differences in subsets of cells that
        might account for only a small fraction of the many
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. To circumvent these
        problems, we used techniques that allow us to carry out
        several hybridizations with probes derived from different
        tissues of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.
        We applied linear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> methods that were
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eberwine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>] and
        have been refined by Baugh 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of
        reverse transcription (RT) and 
        in vitro transcription (IVT), and
        achieved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 5</NUMEX>-fold amplification. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified RNA</ENAMEX> (aRNA) from different tissues of single larva
        was used to perform pairwise comparisons and to identify
        sets of genes with preferential expression. The
        preferential expression of many of the genes in these sets
        had been previously shown by genetic or molecular analysis.
        We also confirmed the preferential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> genes
        that had not been previously characterized by 
        in situ hybridization to imaginal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discs</ENAMEX>. Several of these genes had particularly interesting
        patterns of expression. Our findings show that this method
        can be applied to determine the expression profile of
        individual tissues and to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes with
        specific expression patterns.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Principle of amplification
          The amplification procedure we used is based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eberwine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 24</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], and Baugh 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], and details are given
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA
          was synthesized either from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from
          imaginal discs or from poly(A) +-purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryonic RNA</ENAMEX>.
          The cDNA was used as a template for 
          in vitro transcription, routinely
          generating an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA product</ENAMEX> that represented an
          amplification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,000</NUMEX> fold. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          subjected to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>. The yield from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round represented an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX>-fold
          amplification, resulting in an overall amplification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 5</NUMEX>. Probes for hybridization were synthesized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and labeled with either Cy5 (red) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cy3</NUMEX> (green).
          Arrays were hybridized simultaneously with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>- and
          Cy3-labeled probes, and the intensities and ratios of
          bound fluor were measured for each spot. Because of
          inherent variability in the hybridization efficiency of
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX>, only the ratios of the red and
          green fluorescence were interpreted to indicate relative
          transcript abundance in the starting pool of poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX>.
          A known drawback of linear amplification is that
          sequences at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of transcripts can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> lost. This reduction in sequence
          complexity can probably be attributed to incomplete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>,
          to priming from subterminal locations, and to incomplete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>. To overcome this problem, we supplemented the random
          hexanucleotides that were used to prime the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> RT
          reaction with a template-switch (TS) primer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> includes a guanosine triplet that is designed to
          pair with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' cytidine overhang created by the reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> amplifications
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer alone or random hexanucleotides alone
          yielded similar quantities of aRNA. When these aRNA
          preparations were used for microarray hybridizations,
          many spots had significantly different signal intensities
          (data not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> cDNAs with the most intense
          signals for the probe amplified with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer alone
          had an average length of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6 kilobases</NUMEX> (kb). In contrast,
          after amplification with hexanucleotides alone, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          cDNAs with the most intense signals had an average length
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> kb. We interpret the bias towards long transcripts
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX>-primer amplified probes as indicating better
          preservation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-complexity.
        
        
          Representation of transcripts in amplified
          probes
          The most important feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> that
          amplification must preserve is proportionality, the
          maintenance of the relative concentration of different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. We established the quality of our amplification
          method in several ways. First, we isolated poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          from embryos and subjected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pg, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ng and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliquots</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of linear amplification. The size
          distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aRNA</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> to high-molecular-weight products, with the
          majority <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 240 and 2,000 nucleotides</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>).
          aRNA from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">amplifications</ENAMEX> was then used to
          generate probes and to compare hybridization efficiencies
          of pairs of probes. Such separate amplifications of
          aliquots of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ng of the same embryonic poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          produced signals with similar intensities. A scatterplot
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> signal intensities showed a tight
          correlation coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX>, with a low standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviations</ENAMEX> (SD) of the red/green (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>) ratios for all
          spots (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 0.25</NUMEX>, log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
          Comparisons of probes made from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 pg and 1 ng</NUMEX> and from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ng and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> yielded essentially the same
          level of reproducibility (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC 0.95</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 0.29</NUMEX>; data not
          shown). We conclude that the amplifications were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and that good proportionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          maintained during amplification even if the concentration
          of poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA differed</ENAMEX> by tenfold.
          Comparisons between amplified and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unamplified RNA</ENAMEX>
          indicated that essentially no transcripts were lost
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">amplificaton</TIMEX>. Of the spots that hybridized to
          probes generated from amplified and unamplified embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,514</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,574</NUMEX>) did so with both
          probes. Differences in intensities were, nevertheless,
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC 0.53</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 1.13</NUMEX>, data not shown). We do
          not know whether these differences in intensities were a
          result of changes in relative abundance or in transcript
          length, both of which will affect hybridization signals.
          Nevertheless, the good correspondence of the hybridizing
          spots shows that the aRNA is an essentially complete
          representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of transcripts present
          in the initial pool. We conclude that comparisons of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          different probes on microarrays are valid if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          pools have been amplified in the same way.
        
        
          Pairwise comparisons of imaginal discs and larval
          organs
          We carried out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> separate hybridizations, comparing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pairwise</ENAMEX> combinations of tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This analysis identified many genes that are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed in specific tissues; it also
          provided an independent and quantitative measure of the
          distinct nature of larval tissue and imaginal disc
          cells.
          Hybridizations that were carried out were of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          types: with probes generated from different imaginal
          discs; and with probes from imaginal discs and larval
          organs. Comparisons between imaginal disc probes revealed
          a high degree of similarity, but comparisons between
          imaginal disc and larval organ probes identified many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. We now give a general
          description of these results, starting with those tissues
          that were most alike. It should be noted that these
          results were obtained with microarrays that represent a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of cDNAs obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX> (BDGP)
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 44%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,000/13,600</NUMEX>) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">units</ENAMEX> predicted to be in the 
          Drosophila genome. As this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> may
          not be a truly random subset, extrapolations to the whole
          genome may be of limited value. Indeed, a preliminary
          comparison of our cDNA arrays with microarrays that
          contain short cDNA sequences for all annotated genes
          suggests that the total number of genes that produce a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> with these probes is similar. It is possible that
          the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> cDNAs distributed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> is biased
          toward genes expressed in the tissues we analyzed.
        
        
          Expression profiles of imaginal discs
          
            Left and right wing discs
            We first asked whether microarray hybridization
            could detect differences in expression profiles between
            left and right wing discs. Although few differences
            might be expected, previous studies have revealed a
            left/right difference in wing size, suggesting that the
            respective developmental programs are not identical [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. When probes were prepared independently from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from left and right wing discs of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> instar larva, only minor differences in the
            intensities were observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC 0.99</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 0.14</NUMEX>) (Figure
            2c). This tight correlation again shows the
            reproducibility of the amplification procedure.
          
          
            Leg discs
            We then asked if any of the genes represented on our
            arrays were differentially expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, second
            or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leg discs. Among the several genes that have
            been shown to be differentially required or expressed
            in the different leg discs (for example, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultrabithorax</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] and 
            Sex combs reduced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]),
            only 
            Antp was among the set of cDNAs
            on our microarrays. Comparisons of probes from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leg discs yielded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> values in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX> ranges. To identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes
            in the leg discs, cluster analysis was used to group
            genes with similar expression profiles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. For this
            and all subsequent analyses a threshold setting of >
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.74</NUMEX> (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> log 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed ratios) was applied
            to identify subclusters. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 or 17</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the leg1</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leg3,</ENAMEX>
            leg2<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">:leg3 and leg1:leg2 disc arrays</TIMEX>, respectively
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The induced expression of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> leg discs was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noteworthy</ENAMEX>. This finding is consistent with previous
            studies showing that although 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> is expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
            leg discs, it is expressed at a much greater level in
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> leg discs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Leg and wing discs
            Comparisons were also made between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> leg and
            wing imaginal discs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments). Cluster analysis
            identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were preferentially expressed
            in the leg discs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> discs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
            Notable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> cluster are 
            broad , which is expressed in
            imaginal cells and encodes a family of transcription
            factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], and 
            apterous , which is expressed in
            the dorsal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> cells and is required for wing
            formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wing</ENAMEX> and eye-antennal imaginal discs
            Comparing probes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and eye-antennal
            discs isolated from the same larva revealed a higher
            degree of divergence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> independent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wing</ENAMEX>:eye-antennal comparisons were made. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX>
            genes were identified that had elevated expression in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> discs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified with
            elevated expression in eye-antennal discs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
            Many of these genes are known from previous studies to
            be expressed specifically in these tissues. Among the
            genes with elevated expression in wing discs were 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apterous</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engrailed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apterous</ENAMEX> is expressed
            in the dorsal compartment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc, but not in
            the eye-antennal disc; 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engrailed</ENAMEX> is expressed in the
            posterior compartment cells of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and
            eye-antennal discs. However, inclusion of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engrailed</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing group</ENAMEX> is
            reasonable as the posterior compartment represents
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc, but is less than a
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> of the eye-antennal disc. Among the genes with
            increased expression in eye-antennal discs were 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> , which encodes an eye
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigment precursor</ENAMEX> transporter and the eye-specific
            transcription factor-encoding gene, 
            glass . Consistent with the
            neuronal fate of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the eye-antennal disc,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to be expressed and to function in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuronal</ENAMEX> or glial cells were grouped into the
            eye-antennal cluster: 
            prospero, atonal, fasciclin I,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">longitudinal</ENAMEX> lacking, locomotion defects, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rapgap1</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unc-13</ENAMEX>, sanpodo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caps</ENAMEX> and 
            beta-amyloid protein
            precursor-like. 
            In addition to the genes whose tissue-specific
            expression was confirmed by this array analysis, many
            have not been characterized previously. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these
            novel genes, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG9335</TIMEX>, was notable for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-fold
            relative induction in eye-antennal discs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We
            also single out 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gliolectin</ENAMEX> (glec) in the
            eye-antennal cluster, as this is not consistent with
            previous studies. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glec</ENAMEX> is expressed in midline glia
            cells, but previous 
            in situ hybridization and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> failed to detect it in discs [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>]. We did not characterize 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glec</ENAMEX> further and cannot therefore
            distinguish whether this discrepancy should be
            attributed to greater sensitivity of the array analysis
            or to possible contamination by glial cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in the
            eye-antennal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
            To gauge the validity of these sets of genes, eight
            genes with uncharacterized expression in imaginal discs
            - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>-disc cluster and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from the
            eye-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">antennal</NUMEX>-disc cluster - were chosen for examination
            by 
            in situ hybridization. These
            genes were chosen to represent a spectrum of relative
            intensity of expression, from just above the threshold
            to the maximum observed. All of the patterns we
            obtained correlated with the array analysis and had the
            preferential expression as predicted for each cluster
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were expressed
            specifically in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG10962</TIMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c</NUMEX>) or
            eye-antennal (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG9335</TIMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6g</NUMEX>) discs. CG1607 was
            expressed specifically in the peripodial cells of wing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). CG11798 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6f</NUMEX>) and CG9335
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6g</NUMEX>) were expressed specifically by cells in or
            near the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphogenetic furrow</ENAMEX> of eye discs. CG9335 was
            expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R8</TIMEX> precursor cells that also stained with
            the neuronal-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">22C10 antibody</ENAMEX> in a pattern
            reminiscent of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">atonal</ENAMEX> (data not shown); it was
            also expressed in the optic lobe, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolwig</ENAMEX>'s organ
            (the light-sensing organ of the larva), and in a subset
            of neurons in the embryonic and larval central nervous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>; data not shown). Another notable but
            unexpected finding was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrestin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, the
            metarhodopsin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, was expressed in all
            imaginal discs we tested, not only in eye discs.
            Indeed, 
            in situ hybridization indicated
            that it is expressed more abundantly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> than
            in the eye-antennal disc (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6d</NUMEX>). This distribution
            suggests that the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Arrestin 2</ENAMEX> might
            function outside the visual system.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haltere</ENAMEX> and genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">imaginal</ENAMEX> discs
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five</TIMEX> direct comparisons of haltere and genital
            imaginal discs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the haltere disc and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> in
            the genital disc (see Additional data files). As with
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>/eye-antennal analysis, known genes clustered
            as predicted from previous studies. For example, 
            caudal , a homeobox domain
            transcription factor, partitioned into the genital-disc
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caudal</ENAMEX> is expressed in the
            genital disc but not in more anterior tissues such as
            the haltere disc [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abdominal</ENAMEX> B , which would be
            predicted to show preferential expression in the
            genital disc, was not represented on the arrays. These
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">184</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes correspond to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of
            the entire set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> and represent the largest
            cluster we obtained in all pairwise comparisons of
            imaginal discs.
          
        
        
          Expression profiles of larval organs
          In order to compare and contrast the expression
          profiles of larval organs and imaginal discs, we made
          probes from the poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from several larval
          organs. We directly compared probes from the wing
          imaginal disc with: the salivary gland, an anterior
          fraction of the midgut, parts of the fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and the
          brain hemisphere, including the optic lobe primordium.
          For each experiment, probes prepared from a single larva
          were compared. With the exception of the comparisons
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> leg disc and fat body which was carried
          out once, each of the other comparisons was repeated at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times.
          Visual inspection of the array scans of imaginal disc
          to larval tissue comparisons revealed a large number of
          red and green spots, indicative of a high degree of
          divergence. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> block from one wing
          disc-to-fat body scan is shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7b</TIMEX>. These
          results contrast with disc to disc comparisons which
          produced mostly yellow and only few red or green spots on
          the arrays. For purposes of illustration, the same block
          of spots from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">leg1</NUMEX> disc-to-leg3 disc scan is shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7a</TIMEX>. When the intensity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> signals for
          all cDNAs was plotted on a scatterplot, only a small
          number of data points are positioned away from the
          bisector on which signals of equal intensity in the two
          channels <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7c</NUMEX>). This is indicative of strong
          similarity in expression profiles and is reflected in a
          high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.93</NUMEX>). In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc-to-fat body
          comparison had many data points located on each side of
          the bisector (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC 0.37</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7d</NUMEX>). This disparity
          between leg disc-to-leg disc and wing disc-to-fat body
          comparison was also observed for all other disc-to-disc
          and disc-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">larval</NUMEX> organ comparisons we carried out.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8aillustrates</NUMEX> the numbers of cDNAs that were
          expressed differentially in the various pairwise
          comparisons as a bar diagram. All disc-to-disc
          comparisons showed small numbers of differentially
          expressed cDNAs, whereas the disc-to-nondisc comparisons
          revealed many. The only exceptions were the comparisons
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc to the brain/optic lobe (see
          below). To score for the differences in expression for
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the standard deviations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ratios</ENAMEX> (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed) for each gene were
          calculated for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> experiments and represented in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scatterplot</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8b</NUMEX>). Standard deviations from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">datasets</ENAMEX> derived from disc-to-disc comparisons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          experiments) were all <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX>, indicating the high level
          of similarity among the different imaginal discs. In
          contrast, the disc-to-nondisc comparisons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          experiments) were, with a single exception (see below)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">> 1</ENAMEX>, reflecting a high degree of divergence (Figure
          8b). These observations are consistent with the distinct
          developmental programs of imaginal and larval cells.
          The only exceptions to emerge in this analysis were
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">optic lobe</ENAMEX>/brain hemisphere. Comparisons
          of these neuronal tissues with wing discs revealed only a
          small number of differentially expressed genes (Figure
          8a) and had low standard deviations that were in the
          range of disc-to-disc comparisons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8b</NUMEX>). The optic
          lobe primordium and brain of late <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar larvae
          have only limited functions in larval photoreception and
          contain only a small number of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neurons</TIMEX>. The larval
          brain is populated with clusters of immature neurons,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroblasts</ENAMEX> and ganglion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> cells whose descendants
          will generate the neuronal and glial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of the
          adult optic neuropil and the brain hemisphere. The brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hemisphere</ENAMEX> also differs from other larval tissues by not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degenerating</ENAMEX> during metamorphosis. Instead, most neurons
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">larva</ENAMEX> join with newly formed adult-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> of the adult ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and
          references therein). We interpret the high degree of
          similarity in the expression profiles of imaginal discs
          and the brain/optic lobe preparations as a manifestation
          of the apparent commonalities of their developmental
          programs.
          The number of genes that were found to be induced in
          the larval organs is significantly greater than the
          number of genes in the sets defined by the disc-to-disc
          comparisons. Most of the genes in these sets have not
          been characterized previously and therefore have no known
          function, but the known genes in these clusters
          illustrate the predictive power of the method; we mention
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> examples.
          Many of the genes that are preferentially expressed in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">optic lobe</ENAMEX>/brain hemisphere have predicted or
          described expression and/or function in neurons or glial
          cells (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is 
          lola , which encodes a
          transcription factor involved in axon guidance and is
          expressed in the embryonic optic lobe placodes as well as
          other tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Another is 
          beta amyloid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> precursor-like
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appl</ENAMEX>) , with known expression in the larval optic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lobe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
          The expression profile of the cyclin-dependent kinase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdk-1/cdc2</ENAMEX> ), is also noteworthy.
          Cdk-1 is believed to regulate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G2</NUMEX> checkpoint of the
          cell cycle and is required to maintain diploidy.
          Mutations in 
          Cdk-1 drive cells that would
          normally remain diploid into endoreplication [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. We
          found 
          Cdk-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CG5363</NUMEX>) to be repressed in
          larval tissues when compared to imaginal discs (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). As most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the larval fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, salivary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gland</ENAMEX> and midgut are polyploid (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]), the
          array hybridizations are in good agreement with the known
          function of 
          Cdk-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> .
        
        
          Experimental design and data analysis
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> methods for comparative hybridizations to DNA
          microarrays have been used in previous studies. Most
          commonly, experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> have been compared to a
          common reference sample that contains an appropriate
          diversity of cell types and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. An alternative
          method, which we have used in this study, is to directly
          compare probes generated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>.
          This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> method should be the more sensitive. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplification</ENAMEX> technique we used was such that product
          generated from a single imaginal disc was sufficient to
          make several probes and to carry out multiple array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. By comparing samples that had been
          isolated from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, this method minimized
          differences due to biological variability. By repeating
          experiments several times and by reversing the label
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dye</NUMEX>-flip) for experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in repeat
          hybridizations, we also attempted to minimize
          experimental noise.
          In addition to these design aspects of the
          experimental protocols, we applied a number of filters to
          the data analysis. We selected only those genes with
          hybridization signals over background in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of all
          experiments and with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.74</NUMEX>-fold difference between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 45%</NUMEX>. Applying this method to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          arrays that compared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and eye-antennal discs, we
          found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subclusters</ENAMEX> representing genes preferentially
          expressed in either disc. These lists of genes are
          largely validated by the previously described expression
          pattern in either tissue and by 
          in situ hybridization analysis. We
          understand that the use of any such threshold settings is
          likely to filter out biologically relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. For
          example, when less stringent settings were used (for
          example, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>-fold intensity difference increased the
          gene sets by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>), additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as 
          twin of eyeless were included in
          the eye-antennal cluster and 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Antp and CG6680</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6e</NUMEX>) in the
          wing cluster. Relaxing the requirement to produce a ratio
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 80%</NUMEX> of all experiments to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> identifies yet
          another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes, and includes LD11162 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6j</NUMEX>).
          Conversely, setting a more stringent threshold to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>-fold intensity difference decreased the gene sets by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> and removed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arrestin2</ENAMEX> and CG11798
          (Figure 6d,6f).
          Setting a threshold level for the clusters is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arbitrary</ENAMEX>, and as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes may be expressed
          by only a small subset of cells in the experimental
          sample, each analysis must be evaluated separately.
          Nevertheless, we interpret the good correlation between
          the array analysis and expression patterns we have
          described as indicating that the method is both efficient
          and reliable. Subsequent to the analyses described above,
          we carried out single-disc comparisons with microarrays
          that represent a nearly complete set of the approximately
          14,000 annotated 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The short cDNAs
          spotted on these arrays were produced with specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte Genomics, Inc.</ENAMEX> Use of
          these arrays for disc-to-disc comparisons also identified
          only a relatively small number of differentially
          expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The list of induced
          genes was apparently more complete, however, and
          included, for example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestigal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>-to-leg disc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.K.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Schubiger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.B.K.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations).
          Although the absolute number of genes included in the
          lists of tissue-specific genes is not meaningful, the
          relatively small number of genes that differ between
          imaginal tissues and the significantly greater number of
          genes that differ between imaginal and larval tissues
          certainly is.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linear RNA amplification</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and can be used to generate probes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments with limited quantities of starting
        material. We used this technique to determine the
        expression profiles of imaginal and larval tissues by
        pairwise comparisons of tissues dissected from single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX>. Our approach was validated by the presence of
        characterized genes in the appropriate cluster and by
        confirmation of expression patterns by direct analysis.
        Applying stringent threshold criteria, we found that less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of the genes represented on the arrays were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed when discs were compared to each
        other. Many of these genes have either not been
        characterized previously or lack obvious similarity to
        known coding domains. Those that have been previously
        characterized or share sequence similarities represent a
        broad array of cellular functions. These include basic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> and transporting functions, structural,
        cell-adhesive and signaling functions, as well as
        transcriptional regulation. We lack sufficient
        understanding of the specific processes in most cell types
        to interpret the significance of the genes that they
        specifically express. Future studies will be required to
        identify the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that the identified
        candidate genes describe and to establish how they
        contribute to the execution of specific developmental
        programs.
        We anticipate that the methods we describe here can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to determine and compare the expression profiles of
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> groups in 
        Drosophila tissues. We look forward
        to a further enhancement in resolution that can be achieved
        by combining cell-sorting techniques with this type of
        array analysis. We found that starting with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 10</NUMEX>
        pg poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> yields enough aRNA for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hybridization.
        This amount roughly corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> cells of the third
        instar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Microarray production and labeling
          Spotted cDNA microarrays were produced essentially as
          described at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. In brief, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> (DGC
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, kindly provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,849</NUMEX>
          nonredundant cDNAs was amplified using universal primers
          essentially as described at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The amplification
          products were purified with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> PCR
          purification columns. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were analyzed on
          agarose gels, and reactions with no detectable product,
          multiple bands or bands of unexpected size were repeated
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) or Expand polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and seventy</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cDNAs from our lab
          collection were amplified and added to the set, resulting
          in a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,024</NUMEX> cDNAs. Reactions were arrayed into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well plates and printed on poly-L-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lysine</NUMEX>-coated glass
          slides using a linear servo arrayer and ArrayMaker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 2</ENAMEX> control software. To minimize background caused
          by oxidation of the polylysine coating, slides were
          pretreated by a protocol suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Ebert</ENAMEX>. Before
          post-processing, slides were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65Â°C</TIMEX>, washed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and then in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, followed by centrifugation to dry the
          slides. Slides were then treated, and the hybridization
          reaction was carried out as described at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. We
          indirectly labeled the hybridization probes by
          incorporation of amino-allyl modified nucleotides in a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monofunctional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> or Cy3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dye</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) was subsequently coupled to the reactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridizations</ENAMEX> were carried out for
          most experiments, and dye labeling was reversed to avoid
          systematic bias.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> plates. Midgut was the anterior portion just

          consisted of one brain hemisphere including the optic
          lobe primordium.
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from larval tissues was extracted using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mini RNA Isolation Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zymo Research</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX>, CA) and
          was eluted with RNase-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from embryos
          was extracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). Embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was purified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligotex mRNA Mini</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was not purified before
          amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disc RNA</ENAMEX> because of the small amounts
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
          In situ hybridizations were carried
          out as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Neill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bier</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. The plasmids
          used to generate 
          in situ probes were derived by
          subcloning an aliquot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product that was printed
          onto the microarray with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topo TA</ENAMEX> cloning (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>).
          All cloned products were sequenced and separate
          hybridizations were carried out for sense and antisense
          probes.

          were included in the analysis. A threshold of > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.74</NUMEX>
          (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> of the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed ratios) was chosen for
          all comparisons. A requirement to show induction above
          threshold in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the arrays was applied for
          experiments that were repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times or less. For
          experiments that were repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times this
          requirement was relaxed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>. Standard deviations were
          calculated on the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed normalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> ratios
          using the 'nonbiased' method. To calculate the
          correlation coefficients, the intensities of both
          channels were normalized to equalize the sums of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haltere</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) and genital (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) disc were carried out. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> discs were female (nos <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">149, 150, 224</ENAMEX>) and one was
        male (no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX>). To control for contaminating fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (FB)
        cells in the disc preparations, one direct comparison
        between haltere disc and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FB</ENAMEX> (no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX>) was included. The

        subclusters, respectively, using the same threshold
        settings as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Note the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold induction of
