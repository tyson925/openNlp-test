        Methods for analysis of cDNA microarray data include
        those that cluster hierarchically [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] by principles of
        self-organization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] or by k-means [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. These methods
        yield enormous amounts of information about similarities of
        cell state and coordination of gene regulation, and are
        useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grouping genes</ENAMEX> or transcriptional profiles by
        similarity. They have the limitation that although
        experimental replication enhances the significance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groupings</ENAMEX> observed, the groupings do not inherently
        quantify signal and noise. A fold-value cutoff originally
        was used for this purpose [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and held double duty as a
        signifier of true signal and a boundary beyond which
        observed fold-measures were considered to be reflective of
        actual fold-change. Other approaches use likelihood-based
        methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>] to obtain P-values for gene expression
        differences in replicated comparisons. These methods make
        the assumptions and have the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based
        statistics, but as yet are not formulated to handle more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genotypes, environments, or developmental states
        within a single, cohesive framework.
        One method for analyzing experiments that involve
        numerous treatments is the use of analysis of variance on
        microarray data. Methods have been developed that can yield
        a profusion of information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        experimental variation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>] or, at a biological level,
        about the proportion of variation in expression profile
        attributable to biological factors such as sex or genotype
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. These methods can estimate the magnitude of effects
        as well as significance, but also impose considerable
        constraints on experimental design [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], and they are not
        robust to missing or excluded data.
        Volcano plots [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] have highlighted well the important
        distinction between biological and statistical
        significance. There are effects that may be biologically
        important that may not be statistically significant, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> versa. Because many microarray experiments can have a
        complex and unbalanced design, owing to the technical
        failure of certain hybridizations and the iterative nature
        of the work itself, we have developed an approach for
        assessing statistical significance that could potentially
        use all the available observations in any transitively
        connected design. Our goal is to identify effects of
        biologically significant magnitude to statistically
        significant precision.
        To that end, we introduce a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bayesian</ENAMEX> analysis of gene
        expression level (BAGEL) model for statistical inference of
        gene expression and demonstrate its utility by re-examining
        cDNA microarray data on the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to ethanol
        shock [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], on transcriptional regulation by 
        SNF2 and 
        SWI1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], and on zinc regulation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Ethanol shock
          Alexandre 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] examined the effect
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of ethanol shock on a culture of yeast
          exposed during log-phase growth, by comparing the global
          gene expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>-exposed cells to the
          global gene expression of cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>log phase of
          growth (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). If we arbitrarily assign the node
          with the lower estimated expression to a level of unity
          and assume an equal error variance in both treatment and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> parameters to estimate: the
          mean expression level of the higher-expressed node, and
          their common error variance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2ashows</NUMEX> contour
          plots of the likelihood functions (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> ( 
          MSN4 , 
          HSF1 and 
          GCR1 ) that could potentially be
          responsible for observed downstream changes discussed
          later in this text. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> demonstrate typical
          two-dimensional likelihood surfaces in which the most
          likely expression levels are equivalent, different, and
          very different, respectively. Msn4p is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-finger
          transcriptional activator for many genes regulated by
          Snf1p. When 
          MSN4 has a null allele,
          stress-response genes including 
          HSP12 , 
          HSP26 , 
          HSP42 , 
          HSP78 and 
          HSP104 are upregulated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Hsf1p
          is a heat-shock transcription factor that binds to the
          heat-shock DNA element at both normal and raised
          temperatures. Abundant transcripts from 
          MSN4 and 
          HSF1 could have a role in the
          upregulation of heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> after ethanol shock (see
          below). Abundant transcripts of 
          MSN4 and 
          GCR1 could have a role in the
          concomitant upregulation of the trehalose pathway (see
          below).
          The observed 
          MSN4 ratios in two replicate
          microarrays were inconsistent (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold). This, in
          fact, gives very weak support to the hypothesis that the
          nodes are expressed at nearly the same level. This is in
          part because, conditional on higher error variances,
          larger differences in expression become increasingly
          likely. This effect is seen more dramatically in the
          contour plot for 
          HSF1 , for which the highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dispersed</ENAMEX>, somewhat inconsistent ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>-fold,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold were observed. Consistent data, even
          when relatively dispersed (ratios <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX>), as for 
          GCR1 , shows this effect but with a
          greater slope in the likelihood surface. Although Figure
          2adepicts two-dimensional surfaces from an ordinary
          treatment-reference experimental design with a common
          variance term, it shows typical simple topologies of the
          likelihood surface. Increasing the amount of data in
          larger datasets accelerates reliable convergence upon the
          stationary distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, which is
          required for inference of the posterior distributions of
          the parameters of interest. Furthermore, in larger
          datasets, these posterior unconditional distributions of
          the parameters are unimodal. By inference, the
          multidimensional likelihood surfaces are expected to be
          fairly simple.
          These likelihood plots clearly convey the most
          probable expression levels. To determine statistical
          significance, we examine the posterior distributions of
          the parameters, as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX>. In fact, the credible intervals for the
          expression level for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of these genes overlap
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). There is not enough information in the
          replicated comparisons of each gene's ratio of expression
          to constrain the variance parameter to a small enough
          value so that expression levels could be inferred to lie
          within a small range.
          In contrast to the lack of statistical significance of
          the expression differences observed in these three
          upstream transcription factors, many of the downstream
          conclusions of the original study are not only consistent
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> estimates, but are statistically significant
          by the conservative gene-by-gene criterion of
          nonoverlapping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> credible intervals. For instance, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that the stress-induced chaperonins
          ('heat-shock' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) were upregulated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of
          exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> v/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">v ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Many of these genes are
          clearly significantly abundant in the stressed state
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>), although there is not enough data to
          conclude that all of the set of 
          HSP70 -family genes is
          significantly abundant in the stressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>).
          On the basis of the large estimated expression
          differences (nearly always twofold or greater), an effect
          on the 
          HSP70 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may yet be large and
          biologically important.
          In addition, the trehalose pathway, whose product aids
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in dealing with excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], is clearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> 
          HXK2 , 
          PGM1 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YHL0012w</TIMEX>, 
          TSL1 , 
          TPS2 and 
          ATH1 , form a completely parallel
          pathway from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±</NUMEX>-D-glucose to Î±,Î±-trehalose to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-glucose.
          Of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, none is significantly upregulated.
          Teasing apart the biochemical modes of action of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> ('redundant' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) will lead to a better
          understanding of the modularity of genomes and of the
          varied methods of response to environmental challenges of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Alexandre 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . propose a futile trehalose
          cycle after observing high ratios of expression of 
          NTH1 in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>-shocked
          sample [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. However, the wide credible intervals around
          the expression levels of the genes for the neutral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trehalase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NTH1</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid trehalase ATH1</ENAMEX>,
          the observed accumulation of trehalose in fermentations [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], and the potential for compartmentalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]
          indicate that more data are needed before one can infer
          the extent of such a cycle.
          In addition to the results previously noted, it is
          interesting to observe significant abundant expression of
          numerous open reading frames (ORFs) containing
          transposable-element sequence under ethanol shock (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Although robust inferences are compromised by the
          high sequence homology of these ORFs, the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          were significantly abundant and none was meagerly
          expressed suggests an interesting biological phenomenon.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible effector is the transcriptional regulator
          Gcr1p, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> estimate in ethanol shock is fivefold
          greater than in normal log growth and whose credible
          intervals in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions barely overlap (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Gcr1p elevates transcription of transposable elements
          Ty2-917 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ty1-912</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] as well as of 
          GLK1 of the trehalose pathway ([
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>], and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          There are many reasons why data points in microarray
          experiments are wisely excluded from analysis. Whole
          sectors occasionally fail due to premature drying during
          hybridization, spots are occasionally malformed, and
          experimental signal is frequently so low compared to
          background that a spot is best excluded from the data.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 2,041</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,138</NUMEX> in these data passed the spot
          background-foreground acceptance criteria (see Materials
          and methods) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> experiments. Of these genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
          were significantly different by a gene-by-gene criterion,
          demanding nonoverlapping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals. A
          further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,337</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> had one observation missing; their
          credible intervals were appropriately wider after BAGEL
          analysis of the data and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 22</NUMEX> were statistically
          significant. Genes with one acceptable observation were
          not analyzed. Use of an informative prior distribution on
          the variance, however, would allow such analysis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1gives</ENAMEX> an overview of informative pairwise
          comparisons from the experiments analyzed here. In the
          ethanol-shock experiments, only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> listed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> statistically significantly different out of
          the, on-average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,851</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> measured as greater than
          twofold differentially expressed in these single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> analysis allows unambiguous
          inference as to the expression levels and confidence
          intervals of these genes of interest. In this dataset
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> replicates, we detect no significant
          differences at below a twofold level. Datasets with
          greater direct replication, or with less dispersed
          ratios, or with transitively informative comparisons (see
          below and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.P.T.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data) promise to do so.
        
        
          Deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SWI1and</ENAMEX> SNF2
          Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . undertook a study to
          ascertain which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Snf2p/</ENAMEX>Swi1p
          chromatin-remodeling and transcriptional-activator
          complex subunits, whether the genes had any distinct
          regulatory roles, and how their regulatory roles compare
          in rich and minimal media ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). In rich
          medium, the credible intervals among mutant and wild-type
          expression levels do not overlap for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of the genome). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with estimated
          ratios greater than twofold have overlapping credible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, lower left and lower right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadrants</ENAMEX>). Moreover, almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one quarter of the 251</NUMEX>
          significantly different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have estimated ratios less
          than twofold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densely</ENAMEX> packed between the dashed lines
          because the difference between estimates cannot exceed
          the distance between credible intervals, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). In
          minimal medium, similar results were acquired; a greater
          number of significant results were obtained, due in part
          to greater replication (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The credible
          intervals of mutant and wild-type expression levels do
          not overlap for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10%</NUMEX> of the genome.
          Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with estimated ratios greater
          than twofold have overlapping credible intervals, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">361</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> significantly differentially
          expressed genes are differentially expressed below the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> level.
          Whether these genes represent all of the genes
          controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snf/Swi</ENAMEX> complex depends, of course, on
          what level of difference is deemed biologically
          significant, which in many cases depends upon the gene of
          interest. For many transcription factors, it may be that
          small changes in expression level cause very large
          changes in biological state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>], and for many
          metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, very large changes in expression may
          change pathway throughput very little [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Note also
          that these criteria do not distinguish between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> effects on expression level.
          Presumably, many 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> effects percolate into much
          or all of the genome in very small ways; some of these
          effects may be overwhelmed by systematic error induced by
          the technology, but most should be detectable with
          sufficient replication.
          Credible intervals determined using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAGEL</ENAMEX> make it
          clear that even 
          SER3 , which Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . examine as a candidate gene
          differentially affected in the 
          snf2 Î” and 
          swi1 Î” <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> on the basis of cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> and northern data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], should not be
          inferred to be differentially affected solely on the
          basis of their cDNA microarray data. Although estimates
          of the abundance of 
          SER3 transcript differ by more than
          twofold, the credible intervals for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants
          have extensive overlap (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>). Examining the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX>-media cDNA microarray dataset for other candidates
          for differential expression, we observe that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          genes in which only one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> has
          nonoverlapping credible intervals with the wild type.
          More important, there are just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this
          global dataset for which the credible intervals of
          expression levels in 
          snf2 and 
          swi1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> do not overlap. This
          answers a question posed by Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . as to whether the
          differences in gene expression between these mutants that
          they observed were due to variation in microarray
          measurements or to real differences between the mutants [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. Nearly all differences they observed in the
          transcriptional profiles of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are
          potentially due to variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. A
          scatterplot of the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> estimates of gene-expression levels
          for genes significantly different from wild type, in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> compared to wild type, yields a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). The large number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> meagerly expressed compared to wild type in both
          deletion mutants is consistent with the roles of Snf2p
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Swi1p</ENAMEX> as transcriptional activators. In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globally</ENAMEX>, not a single gene shows a contrasting change in
          expression in comparison to wild type. This affirms the
          conclusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] that the two genes work almost entirely
          in concert in the media conditions tested. The expression
          levels of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> as having
          significantly different expression in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants, 
          ECM33 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YOL154w</ENAMEX>, are shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7b</TIMEX>. The small magnitude of the difference observed
          in 
          ECM33 between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains may
          indicate that this highly statistically significant
          difference is biologically irrelevant, but certainly
          further investigation of the significantly different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YOL154w</TIMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>.
          Quantitation of short transcript sequence tags by
          serial analysis of gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] yields
          absolute counts of expressed sequences in the yeast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. These quantitations may be used to put
          relative expression values obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> on an
          absolute scale. There are issues with sampling error and
          non-uniqueness of sequence tags in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE assays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] as
          well as with the linearity of cDNA microarray ratio
          measures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and with differences between the
          'wild-type' strain used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAGE</ENAMEX> and in cDNA microarray
          experiments. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error are many, but small
          and uncorrelated. With these caveats in mind, Figure
          8aassumes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> counts are exact in order to provide
          absolute expression levels inferred using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> so that the wild-type strain on rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> is
          assumed to have the same expression levels as indicated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE assay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8ashows</TIMEX> that, as observed by
          Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> phosphatase
          genes are meagerly expressed in 
          snf2 Î” and 
          swi1 Î” mutants.
          Note that although there is esthetic appeal to having
          the measurements reported on an absolute basis of
          transcripts per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, little additional information is
          obtained by this transformation for most experimental
          questions, as the result is simply a rescaling of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -axis for each gene. Also,
          whereas the statistical significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> results is
          robust to considerable deviation from general linearity
          of cDNA microarray results, the quantitative result using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> counts as a basis depends critically upon the
          linearity of cDNA microarray measurements. Lastly, it is
          unclear how to scale meagerly expressed genes that had a
          count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> in a SAGE analysis. 
          PHO4 is such a gene; in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8b</TIMEX>,
          we have arbitrarily charted a frequency that would be
          appropriate if it were present at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one</NUMEX> order
          of magnitude below the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAGE</ENAMEX> experiment's detection
          threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> molecules per cell. Neither 
          PHO2 nor 
          PHO4 shows significant evidence of
          differential expression in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">snf2 Î”/</ENAMEX> 
          swi1 Î” mutants. Consideration of
          the raw ratio data led Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] to thus conclude that
          
          PHO5 gene expression is directly
          controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Snf2p/Swi1p.</ENAMEX> 
          PHO3 , a 'constitutive' acid
          phosphatase, shows the same relative abundance across 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">snf2 Î”/</ENAMEX> 
          swi1 Î” mutants as does 
          PHO5 (data not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>
          identity of the nucleotide sequence of these genes means
          that cross-hybridization may confound inference about
          their regulation. However, unlike 
          PHO5 , there is currently no
          evidence that 
          PHO3 is regulated by 
          PHO2 or 
          PHO4 . 
          PHO5 may share a direct <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Snf2p/</ENAMEX>Swi1p
          regulatory mechanism with 
          PHO3 .
          Analysis presented here supports the result that 
          SWI1 and 
          SNF2 work almost entirely in
          concert within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. As
          Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . noted, however, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> may not always be produced together in all
          conditions. Moreover, it should be noted that their
          experimental design has the least power to detect these
          specific differences. This is because all comparisons of
          expression level between the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
          transitive comparisons, which inherit the variance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> wild-type expression
          level as well as the variance associated with the
          expression levels of the two mutant strains. The result
          is that on a log scale the credible intervals of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression level are broader for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants
          than for the wild type. This outcome is a recurrent
          problem with a repeated reference-sample experimental
          design: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> learns the most information about the
          reference sample, which is frequently arbitrary and not
          necessarily of interest. An ideal addition to the
          experimental design in Figure 1bwould be several direct
          comparisons of the mutant strains. Then, both transitive
          and direct information would contribute to the
          statistical power of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> analysis for any comparison.
          It is also clear that an increase in number of
          comparisons would yield more power to detect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, and would indeed find
          more of them. Every single gene that was detected as
          significantly differentially expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants compared to wild type in the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> was
          significantly different in expression level only in the 
          swi1 Î” mutant. The 
          swi1 Î” mutant comparison to wild
          type had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more replicate than did the comparison of
          the 
          snf2 Î” mutant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Zinc regulation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lyons</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . examined wild-type and 
          zap1 mutant strains of yeast
          growing in cultures containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). Zap1p is a
          transcriptional activator that appears to regulate
          transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-uptake system genes in response
          to zinc [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Using the nonoverlapping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> credible
          interval criterion, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> analysis on this data reveals
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">469</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> significantly more abundantly expressed in
          cells grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-deficient medium compared to cells
          grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">supplemented</NUMEX> medium, and reveals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">261</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          significantly less abundant in the same comparison. This
          is a total of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX> of the genome, and is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX>
          of the number found by use of an averaged twofold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX>. A considerable number of the genes viewed as
          abundant by a twofold criterion, then, are not
          significantly different by the credible interval
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>, lower left and lower right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadrants</ENAMEX>). Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> of the genes significantly
          different by the credible-interval criterion are
          significantly different at a ratio of below twofold
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densely</ENAMEX> packed between the dashed lines
          delimiting a twofold change). As one might generally
          expect, making 
          ZAP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonfunctional</ENAMEX> in a
          zinc-deficient environment creates a similar relative
          effect on most significantly differentially expressed
          genes to that created by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> to a
          zinc-deficient wild-type strain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6d</NUMEX>).
          A common technique to discover candidate genes of
          interest in microarray studies is to pick out overlapping
          sets of genes expressed at a ratio greater than some
          cutoff from replicate and/or different microarray
          experiments (for example, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1of</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1of</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> supplants any need to examine overlapping
          gene sets in replicate experiments. Moreover, it provides
          a statistically rigorous method for comparison of
          multiple different experiments. The equivalent of an
          overlap in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lists of highly expressed genes is that
          neither of the credible intervals for gene-expression
          level in a given gene in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental conditions
          overlaps the reference condition.
          For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-regulation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> genes whose levels of gene expression in
          a wild-type genotype and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-deficient medium were
          significantly greater than both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-supplemented
          wild-type and 
          zap1 in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-deficient medium. This
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than were detected using the twofold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX>. Figure 9shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX> results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          PHM7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YGL121c</ENAMEX>, discussed by [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>], as well as results on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. A
          zinc-responsive element (ZRE) consensus DNA sequence,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACCYTNARGGT</ENAMEX> (in the single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> code, where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is any nucleotide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> is C or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> is A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>)
          (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2of</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]), is located in close proximity
          to 
          CTT1 (chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VII</ENAMEX>, location
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">65270-80</ENAMEX>), 
          MNT2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20659-69</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20774-84</ENAMEX>),
          YOL083w (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">442975-85</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YNL253w</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169669</NUMEX>). BAGEL
          results shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9convey</NUMEX> not just the significance
          but also the extent of differential regulation. 
          CTT1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YOL083w</ENAMEX> are like the two
          genes 
          PHM7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YGL121c</ENAMEX> discussed by [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>], in that having the 
          zap1 :: 
          TRP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> does not entirely
          eliminate transcriptional response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">zinc deficiency</ENAMEX>.
          These intermediate levels of expression indicate the
          action of auxiliary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-regulatory mechanisms.
          Figure 10charts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several transcription</TIMEX> factors that are
          significantly differentially expressed below the twofold
          level. For every gene shown, the credible intervals
          between wild type in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> and wild type in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"><</ENAMEX> 100
          nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> do not overlap. For 
          VPS20 , in contrast to the other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, expression is greater when in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-deficient
          medium. Expression levels in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10are</NUMEX> graphed
          cosequentially with the experimental design structure
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). As a result, the increasing size of credible
          intervals as one scans from the middle expression nodes
          to the expression nodes at the ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
          experiments is clear. The largest credible interval is
          for the 
          zap1 strain grown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 Î</TIMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>, on
          the far right of each cluster of columns. This is as
          expected, given that it is at the end of the line of
          comparisons and is informed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> cDNA microarray
          comparison. In a balanced linear set of comparisons such
          as this, it turns out that for any gene on a log scale,
          the credible intervals around the gene-expression values
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> are greater than the credible intervals
          around those in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
          For an analysis such as this one, the statistical
          power could be improved if expression nodes were compared
          to more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. Specifically, direct
          comparisons between wild type in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX> and 
          zap1 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX> would complete a
          circle of comparisons, increasing transitive information
          on all expression nodes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-circle comparisons would
          also contribute considerable power. Generally,
          eliminating 'ends' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of comparisons should be a
          goal of any cDNA microarray experimental design.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Small datasets such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol dataset</ENAMEX> are very good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for use of a more informative prior distribution
        to keep variances within a reasonable range and yield
        better results. Analysis of larger datasets indicates that
        true variances for microarray data within this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are
        not larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. The impact of using less-vague priors,
        especially for the variance, when there are few
        comparisons, is under investigation by a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. A hierarchical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bayesian</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] has been
        used to analyze ratio data and provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
        intervals for the log ratio of gene expression from
        reference to control. This method assumes normal
        distributions of the log ratios rather than ratios of
        normal distributions. It has a hierarchical structure that
        allocates error variance among microarrays and experiments.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest use of calibration data, or,
        alternatively, empirical evaluation of the distribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variances</ENAMEX> across all other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in order to construct a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior</TIMEX>. A subset of genes of nearly equal intensity can be
        used to form a prior for variances [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. This prior was
        used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> to input reliable variances in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests of significance. Promising
        advances have been made on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> methods for correcting
        misleading fold-change measurements made from low-intensity
        spots [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], using a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> rather than normal model of
        ratio results.
        All these methods have considerable potential to be
        incorporated as priors into a framework such as that
        presented here, so that the prior may be applied to
        multiple samples from different genotypes, environments or
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Priors such as those above should
        result in smaller credible intervals and detection of
        increasingly significant differences because they curtail
        the exploration of unrealistically high variances that
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX> have too few observations to rule out 'on
        their own'. Continued work in this area, using an increased
        amount of non-ratio data provided from scanned microarrays,
        should be very fruitful [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, posterior
        distributions from such analyses of gene-expression level
        have subsequent use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bayesian</ENAMEX> methodologies for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] and tumor identification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
        In summary, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based approach we have implemented
        can accommodate complex and unbalanced experimental
        designs. Some research will continue to be carried out
        comparing just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples multiple times. However, complex
        designs will increase in popularity as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        explore multiple genotypes, environments and developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> within a single research project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The utility
        of this approach in determining levels of gene expression
        may be maximized if these designs incorporate certain
        features.
        First, compare samples of direct interest directly. When
        interested in the differences between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, compare
        them to each other rather than to an arbitrary reference
        sample [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Whenever possible, study a few expression
        nodes thoroughly, rather than many superficially.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, replicate each comparison at least once [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        Whether this is done directly by incorporation of dye
        during reverse transcription, or, preferably, by labeling
        incorporated amino<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-allyl-dUTP</ENAMEX>, reverse the dye labeling to
        ameliorate any dye effect thereof [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 18</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, eliminate 'ends' of comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> by carrying
        out hybridizations comparing one end to another. This
        allows reconciliation of transitive data around a circle of
        comparisons. The more circles created, the more
        reconciliation occurs. The smaller the circumference of the
        circle created, the stronger the transitive power.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, connect nodes otherwise distantly located on a
        chain of comparisons with extra cross-comparisons. The
        number of 'extra' comparisons to make depends on what size
        of effect is of interest. The observation of a small but
        significant effect on key regulatory genes may be of
        greater biological interest than the same observation on a
        metabolic enzyme. The appropriate weighing of the cost of
        additional comparisons against the greater precision of
        measurement depends critically upon the question being
        asked.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX>-course experiments or any other experiment with
        an explicit ordered 
        x -axis these guidelines may still be
        followed, as long as replicate comparisons are made among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inferred</ENAMEX> estimates at each node are assessed
        independently of location along the 
        x -axis, so that regressions across
        them are valid. Ultimately, experimental design may be
        subject to limitation owing to lack of resources or
        experimental failure. Fortunately, within a framework such
        as that developed here, missing spots or missing
        comparisons do not require any special consideration or any
        change in methodology. Credible intervals acquired for less
        well determined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or less well determined expression
        nodes are correspondingly larger. This quantitative
        information on gene-expression levels tendered by a
        thorough analysis of microarray results should be carefully
        considered in assessments of the biological effects of
        genetic or environmental differences upon cellular
        state.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Normalization
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol-shock dataset</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], raw data from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePix</ENAMEX> files was processed as follows. Any spot was
          excluded from analysis if both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy3</TIMEX> and Cy5
          fluorescence signals were within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations
          of the distribution of intensities of the background
          pixels for that spot. These low-intensity spots are those
          most aberrant in fold-change and are those for which the
          magnitude is adjusted most by the model of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Expression values
          were normalized by linear scaling of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> values so
          that the mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5 and Cy3</TIMEX> values of nonexcluded spots
          were equal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experiments thereby achieved a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> log-log intensity plot for included spots, with
          slope <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> was linearized by
          exponentiation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, before
          normalization of the means.
          For other experiments, ratio and spot pass criteria
          were used as reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. In the dataset
          released by Sudarsanam 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], one of the three
          reported microarray hybridizations between wild-type and 
          snf2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nodes</ENAMEX> was excluded from
          analysis because it had an anomalous global mean log
          ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.26</NUMEX>, whereas for all others that value was
          very nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-regulation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
          no pass criterion had been used to ensure each spot on
          each microarray carried considerably more signal than
          noise. The data appeared to be of high quality. However,
          in a few cases, one or two misleading data points from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">low-intensity</ENAMEX> spots may have led to especially high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-by-gene error variance estimates and thus concealed
          otherwise significant differences.
          The best normalization method and spot pass criteria
          are highly dependent on cDNA microarray protocol,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>, experimental experience and analytical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. As long as normalization method and spot pass
          criteria are applied uniformly within a dataset, the
          resulting ratios should be appropriate for analysis by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> described here.
        
        
          Model
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, the original idea was that,
          with current technology, spots on a cDNA microarray had a
          number of confounding pseudolinear terms - whose
          variation from experiment to experiment could be
          minimized but not eliminated - which contributed to the
          intensity measurements observed when a hybridization was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned</ENAMEX>. Model parameters under this scheme differ from
          those used for high-density oligonucleotide microarrays [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. These terms included the density and size of the
          cDNA deposition, the correspondingly larger or smaller
          amount of labeled mRNA hybridized to the microarray, the
          hybridization conditions and the sequence of the gene [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>]. With these assumptions, the post-normalization
          intensity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fluorescence channel at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> spot
          may be modeled linearly as
          
          where is the absolute quantity of mRNA per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, the 
          c 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
           are terms for any 
          q multiplicatively confounding
          factors, the 
          c 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX> 
           are terms for any 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">q - t</ENAMEX> linearly confounding factors,
          and is an error term accounting for mild pseudorandom
          departures from linearity and unavoidable small
          variations in cell-growth conditions. Note that
          multiplicative error associated with the sample must have
          been compensated for by an appropriate normalization ([
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>], reviewed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]); if, on the other hand, there are
          considerable multiplicative factors that are common to a
          spot, they are accommodated by the 
          c 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
           above. This model cannot be directly implemented
          because experimental replication to estimate each
          confounding term is technically difficult. These
          difficulties led to a rapid conclusion that the
          information that can be best obtained from a cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment is ratio information rather than
          absolute quantification. This is because the confounding
          spot terms above will apply equally to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples
          competitively hybridized against a single spot on a
          single microarray, yielding a ratio that correctly
          represents the ratio of expression levels in the
          comparison of interest.
          When comparing just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, ratio measurements
          are nearly as good as absolute data. However, when more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genotype or environmental condition or cell
          developmental stage is examined, ratio measurements
          rapidly become cumbersome because comparing across
          numerous states requires a common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of measurement.
          Therefore it is of interest to use these ratio
          measurements within a statistical model to estimate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels in a common (if arbitrary) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>,
          and also to assess the significance of such a
          difference.
          Consistent with the original interpretation of cDNA
          microarray data that privileged ratio over absolute
          quantification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], the observed ratios of intensities,
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            ij 
           , maybe modeled as
          
          where 
          
            i 
           , and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           are the scaled quantities of mRNA in samples 
          i versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . This expression is true for any
          terms that are consistent for both mRNA preparations,
          regardless of linearity, which is fortunate, as there are
          known nonlinearities in microarray data acquisition [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>]. This yields
          
          Assuming that error terms are composed of many small,
          unbiased effects, and scaling the error terms 
          
            i 
           and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           by
          
          a constant for every microarray spot, so that they are
          distributed with variances specific to each sample, 
          
            i 
           2and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, it follows directly that the observed ratio data,
          
          z 
          
            ij 
           , are drawn from
          
          This can be true even if the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> across spots and arrays is decidedly not
          Gaussian, because confounding factors which vary linearly
          or multiplicatively or even interactively across spots or
          arrays are commonly presumed not to be different between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> labeled samples hybridized to a single spot [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
          Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> may, under this formulation, have
          different variances as well as different means.
          The ratio of standard normal distributions is a Cauchy
          distribution, which has the unpleasant property that it
          has no moments. The ratio of nonstandard normal
          distributions is not much better. Fortunately, the
          infinite tails of the normal distributions that result in
          this property are not generally observed in real data; in
          fact, a model that allows negative gene expression levels
          is not valid. The joint normal distribution may be
          truncated at a considerable distance from its peak, along
          an elliptical probability contour within the positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadrant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], yielding a ratio 
          z 
          
            ij 
           distributed approximately as
          
          This approximation of the density of the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          nonstandard normal distributions is extremely good as
          long as 
          
            i 
           >> 
          
            i 
           , and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           >> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           , which is certainly true for informative cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. It is not symmetrical like a
          normal distribution, but skewed with a long right-hand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX>, like gene expression data. Moreover, as implied
          above, if microarray data contain no negative expression
          levels (a natural proposition), it is likely that the
          distribution of 
          z above is closer to the true
          distribution of microarray data than is the distribution
          of the ratio of true normal distributions.
          Let us consider how this result may be used. An ideal
          statistical framework for the analysis of microarray
          ratio data could be used to analyze microarray data of
          any experimental design including any number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX>, genotypes, or developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>; would be
          highly robust to missing data; and would yield estimates
          of the magnitude of expression differences and measures
          of statistical significance across all treatments,
          genotypes, and developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
          The number of expression nodes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , is equal to the number of
          permutations of strain, treatment, and developmental
          state that are examined. Unless informative prior
          information about expression levels or error variance is
          used, the following (minimal) requirements must be met.
          First, every node of interest must be present in at least
          one comparison. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, every node of interest must be
          connected to every other node of interest by an unbroken
          chain of comparisons. And <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, there must be as many
          comparisons as there are mean and variance parameters to
          be estimated.
          If separate error variances for each sample are to be
          estimated as well as means, the last requirement
          indicates that there must be at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n - 1</ENAMEX> measurements when each
          expression node is assumed to have an independent
          variance, and there must be at least 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> measurements when each expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">node</ENAMEX> is assumed to have the same error variance. A few
          measurements beyond the minimum contribute greatly to the
          power to detect differences in gene expression and to the
          ease with which significance of results is ascertained
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> framework. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the
          comparison structure of experiments examined in this
          paper. The three-dimensional matrix of ratio results from
          these comparisons, 
          
            Z 
           , may be constructed, with dimensions 
          i denoting the sample labeled with

          genes whose matrix

           are control, self-self hybridizations, in which the
          same expression node has been labeled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyes</ENAMEX>. In this framework, these controls can and should be
          included in the dataset if performed with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
          experimental error included in their preparation. They
          contribute to estimation of the error variance of
          genes.
          Appropriate informative priors for the variance of
          microarray data are currently under investigation by a
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35, 36</TIMEX>]. An informative prior must
          be clearly justified in order to prevent inappropriate
          conclusions of statistical significance. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noninformative</ENAMEX> prior distribution, uniform across
          positive real numbers, has been used for both the
          expression levels and for their variance. In theory, we
          use a uniform prior for the variance, bounded from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. In practice, the upper limit, beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 or so</TIMEX>, makes
          no difference, as such high values are very improbable
          and are never sampled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> in the datasets
          analyzed here. This uniform prior gives the microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> itself the greatest impact on the inferred means and
          variances, and implies that credible intervals
          constructed are close to those that would be found by
          maximum likelihood if analytical integration of the full
          multidimensional parameter surface were feasible. A
          frequently used 'noninformative' prior such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-1</ENAMEX>[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] is
          in this case not desirable, because, in practice, the
          most likely variances observed are so small that this
          prior has a considerable impact on the posterior
          distribution.
          Fortunately, we may use the constant denominator of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayes</ENAMEX>' rule formulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 5</ENAMEX>) to assert
          that
          
          This may be used to construct a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> whose
          stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of
          the parameters given the data. A vector and a vector of
          initial expression levels, [ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,..., 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           ] is chosen such that at step 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and subsequent values in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> are determined iteratively by choosing successive
          proposed values according to an acceptance rule.
          Our proposed values are constructed in two separate
          steps. First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> gene-expression level parameters
          from are chosen at random. A step size is drawn at random
          from a triangular distribution centered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> with
          range [- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼</ENAMEX> ,+ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼</ENAMEX> ]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chosen
          parameters is incremented by the chosen step size, and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is decremented by the same quantity, so that
          is maintained, where the apostrophe indicates a proposed
          parameter value. In the next iteration, the variance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">parameters,</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX> 
           2are incremented by an amount drawn at random from a
          triangular distribution with range to form . Because
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> have probabilities of transitions from
          the current state to the proposed state equal to the
          probabilities that the converse transitions would have,
          this proposal scheme satisfies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hastings</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] and can be
          implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX>. Thus the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conjecture</ENAMEX> is accepted for the next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the Markov
          chain if
          
          Otherwise the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is retained for the next
          iteration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
          These steps are repeated over many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> in
          order to 'burn in' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, so that it converges from
          the initial parameter settings to a stationary
          distribution. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are sampled from the
          chain at regular intervals to build a posterior
          distribution for each parameter, integrated across the
          probable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of all other parameters. An easy-to-use
          stand-alone software program entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAGEL</ENAMEX>, which
          implements this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bayesian</ENAMEX> analysis of gene expression
          levels on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacOS</ENAMEX> or Windows <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, is available on the
          web with an online manual [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. It accepts tab-delimited
          text files of ratio data as input.
          To decrease the number of parameters that must be
          estimated, we estimate a single variance parameter for
          each gene across all expression nodes, which is
          equivalent to the assumption that 
          
            i 
           and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           . from the same distribution for every sample. On
          larger, more highly replicated datasets, where all
          parameters could be estimated, constraining the variance
          has not led to substantially different results (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P.T.</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.M. Ranz</ENAMEX>, personal communication).
          All analyses in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> were performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of burn-in, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> generations
          during which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was sampled every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> generations
          to construct the posterior distribution. Runs using
          multiple starting vectors and were performed and always
          converged to the same, unimodal, posteriors, indicating
          that this is a well-behaved multidimensional likelihood
          surface (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). Results reported here were the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outcomes of Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> started with the elements of
          all equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and started with the elements of all
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>. Step sizes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼</ENAMEX> and were tuned for each gene so that
          acceptance ratios for each parameter update were in the
          efficient and well-mixed range (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. If
          acceptance ratios for either parameter jump were less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> or greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was run again
          with a better-tuned jump size, until acceptable ratios
          for both parameters were obtained. In this way, there is
          no alteration of the jump size during any run. There is
          only the evaluation of pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> to optimize
          jump size.
          Output from the BAGEL software is in the form of a
          tab-delimited text file with one header row. Each row
          thereafter displays the results for a single gene,
          including columns with the estimate of expression level
          for each sample (the median of the posterior
          distribution); the additions and subtractions to make <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          upper and lower bounds on that estimate; the stationary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> rates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> steps for that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>;
          and a column that reads 'TRUE' when those rates are
          acceptable. Further columns contain the posterior
          probabilities for whether that gene's expression level in
          each expression node is greater, or lesser, than that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s expression level in each other expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">node</ENAMEX>.
