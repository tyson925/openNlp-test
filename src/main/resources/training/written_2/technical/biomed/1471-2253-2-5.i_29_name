        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is a new generic "physiologically based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetic</ENAMEX> model" (PBPK) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> provides an
        approach to modeling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> distribution and metabolism that
        is based on the use of a physiologically realistic model of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> has been designed to provide a
        rigorous mathematical treatment that takes into
        consideration all the different biochemical and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> properties that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> may have, and yet be
        very simple to use. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> in this series have
        described the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to propranolol, D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, inulin and protein bound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> will describe the
        application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to volatile solutes, with particular
        emphasis on anesthetics.
        The use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> to model pharmacokinetics requires
        detailed information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-tissue partition
        coefficient for each organ. This is the feature that has
        limited the applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> to human studies since it
        is normally assumed that these tissue partition
        coefficients must be determined for each specific solute
        that is studied. The major design philosophy behind PKQuest
        is to increase the predictive power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> so that it
        can applied to a large variety of solutes without the need
        for this specific information. This is accomplished by
        preprogramming a "standard human" data set that contains
        most of the information that is required to model the
        different solutes. The new approach for the volatile
        solutes that is developed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to assume that
        the tissue partition of these solutes is determined
        entirely by a) the oil/water partition coefficient and b)
        the fraction of lipid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and each organ i (klip
        [i]). A set of "standard human" values for klip [i] is
        assigned for each organ. Using this assumption, the
        pharmacokinetics of any inert volatile solute is completely
        determined (as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 2</NUMEX> parameters:
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>/air (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX>) and oil/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX>) partition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX>. This allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to be used to predict the
        pharmacokinetics of any inert volatile solute for which
        experimental values for these simple physical chemical
        parameters are available. If the solute is metabolized (as
        is the case for halothane and toluene) then additional
        adjustable parameters (e.g., metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver Km</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vmax</ENAMEX>)
        must be added.
        As a test of this approach to modeling volatile solutes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> was applied to the simultaneous uptake and washout
        measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, enflurane, halothane, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methoxyflurane</ENAMEX>. Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to these
        simultaneous anesthetic measurements provides a stringent
        test of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> assumptions because only the specific
        partition coefficients (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX>, etc) vary for the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> while all the other parameters (e.g. percent body
        fat, klip, fat blood flow, ventilation, etc.) must be
        identical. In addition, using the same set of parameters to
        fit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 20</NUMEX> fold difference in concentration between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. data provides
        another test. Finally, to show that the validity of this
        approach extended beyond the anesthetics, it was also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to toluene, a volatile solute for which detailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human PBPKs</ENAMEX> are already available. Since the value of the
        oil/water partition coefficient varies from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> for nitrous
        oxide to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> for toluene, the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to model
        these different solutes using a single set of organ fat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> (klip) demonstrates the generality of this
        approach.
        Anesthesiologists have used physiological models
        incorporating air/water partition coefficients and volumes
        of distribution to predict the kinetics for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a 150</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, there have been only a few
        applications of detailed, organ specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anesthetics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapleson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> developed a detailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anesthetic PBPK</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] and measured the relevant PBPK
        parameters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fukui</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] have developed complex PBPKs
        in which the anesthetic interacts with and modifies the
        organ parameters. The primary application of these models
        has been to illustrate the theoretical importance of the
        different model components. The only detailed attempts to
        fit human data with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> are for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrous oxide</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] and halothane in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Allott, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steward</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapleson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] also fit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> to the experimental data
        for halothane in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. Both of these halothane studies
        were incomplete because they did not account for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>. The most complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> for halothane is the rat
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loizou et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] which includes a metabolic
        component that is saturable and inactivates. There have
        been no previous attempts to use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> to model multiple,
        simultaneously measured anesthetics such as is described in
        this paper.
        In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapleson</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> does not model the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">vascular time</TIMEX> delays and
        therefore is not applicable to short time kinetics (less
        than a minute). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> does incorporate a number
        of features that are not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mapleson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        including tissue metabolism, capillary limitation (either
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> or tissue) and ventilation-perfusion
        mismatch.

        Methods
        
          PBPK program and its assumptions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] was used for all the analysis in this
          paper. All the figures shown in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are direct
          copies (in jpeg format) of standard PKQuest output.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> makes several simplifying assumptions (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          ). It is assumed that each organ can be modeled as a
          single well-stirred compartment. For the volatile solutes
          studied here, it is also assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is flow limited so that the partial pressure in
          the tissue is equal to that in the vein leaving the
          tissue. This is clearly an approximation and effects such
          a diffusion gradients, countercurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and
          heterogeneous organ blood flows [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] will produce
          small deviations from this assumption. It is also assumed
          that the influence of the anesthesia in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpenter et</ENAMEX>
          al. studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters can be neglected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . Although these solutes may consist of stereo
          enantiomers, it is assumed that there is no significant
          difference in the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers,
          which is supported by experiment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . It is
          assumed that the metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and enflurane is negligible [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] , and that the loss through the skin can be
          neglected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          The free water concentration (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">free</ENAMEX> ) plays a central role in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> calculations (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] for details). For the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or any organ, the free concentration can be related
          to the total (measured) concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ctot</ENAMEX>) by the
          relation C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot</ENAMEX> = C 
          free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wfract</ENAMEX>/fw where wfract is the
          water fraction in the organ and fw is the fraction of the
          solute that is free in the water phase. The parameter fw
          [i], the fraction free in organ i (including vascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX>), characterizes the fraction free (and
          bound) and the corresponding tissue/blood partition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX>. In general, this parameter must be
          experimentally determined for each solute (and organ).
          However, for these volatile solutes it is assumed that
          the "bound" solute is equal to the solute dissolved in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or tissue lipid. For this case, the parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fw</ENAMEX> [i] is completely determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kfwat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>/water
          partition coefficient) and klip[i] (the fraction of lipid
          in each organ):
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fw</ENAMEX>[i] = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wfract</ENAMEX>[i]/(wfract[i] + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX>*klip[i])
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> uses only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>/air
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX> and klip[i] for the actual
          calculations, a variety of combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat, Kwair</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>/air partition), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kbwat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>/water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX>), etc. can be entered. For example, for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">anesthetics</ENAMEX> investigated here, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kbair</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX> are known experimentally and are entered.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> then uses these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters to calculate the
          corresponding value for klip [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>] and replaces the
          default "standard human" value by this experimental
          value.
        
        
          Experimental pharmacokinetic data
          The experimental data was obtained from previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>. The anesthetic data was based on the
          results in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Both of these studies determined
          the simultaneous uptake and washout of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrous oxide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>), enflurane, halothane, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methoxyflurane</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> used low, sub-anesthetic
          concentrations of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> with a total inhaled
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2%</NUMEX> so that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gas effect [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] was negligible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpenter et al.</ENAMEX> first induced
          anesthesia with high (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65-70%</NUMEX>) concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and then, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> had equilibrated, added the other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> at concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> times higher than that
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> (at a total inhaled concentration of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) and then washed them out while maintaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constant N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> levels. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gas
          effect can also be neglected for the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpenter et</ENAMEX>
          al. for enflurane, halothane, and methoxyflurane (but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>). The experimental data points
          were obtained by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN-SCAN</ENAMEX>-IT (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Scientific</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>) to read the data from the published figures
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">figs. 2and 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.; figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al.</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al</ENAMEX> data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] represents the mean value
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> healthy fasted unanesthetized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> breathing for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0069 %</NUMEX> methoxyflurane;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0136 %</NUMEX> halothane; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0186 %</NUMEX> enflurane; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.88%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          represents the mean values for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> female
          healthy subjects undergoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nephrectomy. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were administered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65-70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> and then a mixture
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.348%</NUMEX> isoflurane, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.518 %</NUMEX> enflurane, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.226</NUMEX> halothane
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0469 %</NUMEX> methoxyflurane was administered for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>.
          After discontinuing these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>, anesthesia was
          maintained with fentanyl, thiopental and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> for the duration of the operation.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. washout data was collected at
          intervals during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>, and once a day for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 5 to 8 days</TIMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> became ambulatory upon
          recovering from surgery with the associated changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters (eg. muscle blood flow, ventilation) only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> out to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours</TIMEX> was used. In fitting this data it is
          assumed that using the mean values of the concentration
          versus time averaged over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is equivalent to
          treating these values as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a single
          "average" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . For this data with its
          relatively small standard error (typically Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 to 3 %</NUMEX> of
          the inspired concentration), this should be a reasonably
          accurate assumption.
          The toluene data was based on the published
          investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] exposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Caucasian subjects</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 ppm</NUMEX> each of
          1H8-toluene and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2H8</NUMEX>-toluene for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> at rest, and
          collected venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and alveolar breath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for up
          to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 hours</TIMEX>. Their subject-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>
          of the observed data variability and found
          interindividual toxicokinetic differences. All the data
          for each individual in this series was generously
          provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.H. Pierce</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce et al.</ENAMEX> series were chosen to be modeled by

          differences in percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) and
          corresponding differences in toluene kinetics.
        
        
          Experimental partition coefficients
          The partition coefficients were based on previous
          published data. The values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> for the anesthetics
          (enflurane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>; halothane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O 0.47</ENAMEX>; methoxyflurane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.33</NUMEX>) were
          from the review by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steward et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The average
          values of blood/air partition coefficient for the Munson
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table II</ENAMEX>) were used for the

          value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX> was obtained from different sources
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enflurane 130</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>

          , methoxyflurane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ) Identical values were used
          for modeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
          For the toluene data, the value of the blood/air
          partition coefficient was measured for each of the two
          subjects that were modeled (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ). The value
          of the lipid/air partition coefficient was based on the
          average value reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Human</ENAMEX> parameters
          The default standard values are stored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>
          procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The values used for organ flows,
          volumes, etc. are identical to those used in all the
          other applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . A list of some
          of the parameters is included in additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For a

          The critical new parameter set required for this
          application is the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">klip</ENAMEX> [i], the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          lipid in each organ i. This parameter (along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfwat</ENAMEX>)
          determines the tissue/water partition. This parameter set
          was determined by finding values of klip that would
          reproduce the tissue/air partition coefficients reported
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhou et</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] for a number of anesthetic solutes for
          human heart, brain, liver, muscle and fat and assuming
          that the other organs (skin, intestine, kidney) had
          similar values. The values of klip chosen for each organ
          are: liver <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.028</NUMEX>; intestines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>; kidney <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.028</NUMEX>; and all
          other organs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX>. The only other parameter that was
          adjusted to fit the data for these solutes was the fat
          blood flow. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> global (simulated annealing) and
          local (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX>) optimization routines were used to select
          the fat blood flow that provided the best fit to the
          enflurane data. This value was then used for all the
          other solutes that were investigated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest Maple</ENAMEX> input procedure
          The pharmacokinetics for each of the solutes is
          completely characterized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> input procedure for
          that solute. The complete procedures are available on the

          As described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , each compound modeled

          input
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight was set arbitrarily to the standard
          value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kg</ENAMEX> since the input dose should scale with
          body weight through the alveolar ventilation parameter.
          The fraction body fat (= <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fat</ENAMEX>) was chosen based on the
          standard literature average value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. Since PKQuest
          always uses units of liters, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX>, the
          concentration of ml anesthetic<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/100</NUMEX> ml total volume
          (abbreviated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as %</NUMEX>) used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. corresponds
          to a "cunit" of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 ml</NUMEX> per liter (this parameter is only
          used for display of output and does not directly enter
          the calculations). The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> is the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">value</ENAMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] for the fasting
          subjects. The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> is from the standard
          reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfair</ENAMEX> is based on measurements of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubility</ENAMEX> in olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and in human fat tissue [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . The input was a constant <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minute</TIMEX> inhaled
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.518%</NUMEX>. Note that all the parameters
          required to characterize enflurane are direct
          experimental measurements so that there are no adjustable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (see Discussion Section for further discussion
          of this point).
          It should be emphasized that the above short procedure
          completely characterizes the enflurane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. All the
          other parameters are determined by the default values set
          by the calls to defaultpar() and standardhuman(). (The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can override the default values and input an
          arbitrary value for any parameter.). The partition
          coefficients for the individual organs are determined by
          the default value for the fraction of lipid in each organ
          i (klip[i]).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output using this "enflurane" input
          procedure is shown in the left hand column of fig 1along
          with the experimental data (squares) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al.
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> shows the results during uptake
          and washout and the figures in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> rows
          show the semi log plots of the uptake and washout,
          respectively. All the figures shown in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are
          copied directly from the standard PKQuest output.
          The corresponding plot for the enflurane data of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] is shown in the right hand column of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Exactly the same set of parameters were used
          except that: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the fraction of body fat was reduced to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>, the standard literature average value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> young male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> used in this study; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the
          experimental inhaled enflurane concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0186 %</NUMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> (versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.518%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpenter et al</ENAMEX>). The fact that both sets of data can be
          fit using an identical parameter set, even though the
          concentrations differ by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>, indicates that
          the enflurane pharmacokinetics must be linear over a
          large concentration range.

          be used because of the large second gas effect.). The

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> literature values: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O Maple</ENAMEX> procedure). The agreement
          between the PKQuest predictions and experiment is
          excellent for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> uptake. However, there is a
          significant deviation between the predictions and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> during the washout that is especially apparent in
          the semi log plot. There is no obvious explanation for
          this discrepancy and it may be artifactual (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion Section</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Halothane
          There is an additional complication when modeling the
          halothane data because a significant fraction of the
          halothane disappearance is the result of metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 37 38 39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loizou et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] developed a
          detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> with the halothane metabolism
          described by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> parameter function that included both
          Michaelis-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menten</ENAMEX> and inactivation components. Although
          there is qualitative evidence that halothane metabolism
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is non-linear, saturating at higher
          concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , the quantitative aspects of
          halothane metabolism are poorly characterized in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>. Probably the most relevant data is provided by
          investigations in miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sawyer et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ]
          reported that the percent liver clearance during the
          halothane washout in miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> at an
          alveolar concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0026%</NUMEX> and fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> at an
          alveolar concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halsey et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] found
          that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the halothane entering the miniature swine
          liver was metabolized at a steady state alveolar
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0065%</NUMEX>.
          For this study it was assumed that the halothane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> could be described by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameter
          Michaelis-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menten</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vmax</ENAMEX>) liver component. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          parameters were adjusted to so that they a) provided a
          good fit to the experimental halothane data of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpenter et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] (inhaled concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.226%</NUMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] (inhaled concentration of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0135%</NUMEX>) and b) were roughly consistent with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">miniature swine</ENAMEX> data. The final values in partial
          pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01 ml/100</NUMEX> ml and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vmax</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard 70 Kg human</TIMEX>. This corresponds to
          a water concentration for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Km of 3.57 Î</NUMEX>¼mole/liter and a Vm
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21.4 Î</NUMEX>¼mole/min. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX> is similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.03</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼mole/liter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Given the limited human
          quantitative data that is available, these human
          metabolic parameters should be regarded only as a first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3shows</TIMEX> that this set of metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constants</ENAMEX> provided a good fit to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> fold range of

          concentration) experiments. The partition coefficients
          used in these calculations were the standard literature

          additional file 1for the complete halothane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>
          procedure). For these parameters, the percent liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">halothane</ENAMEX> clearance varied from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> at an alveolar
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0002%</NUMEX>; to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> at a concentration of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.07%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">to 7%</NUMEX> at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.26%</NUMEX> - similar to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swine</ENAMEX> data. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest PBPK</ENAMEX> results, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">halothane</ENAMEX> should have been recovered during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 day</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout</TIMEX> period relative to the total uptake. This is
          somewhat greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> recovery directly estimated
          for this same data by measuring the mixed expired
          halothane concentration and ventilation rate once per day
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The standard output of PKQuest
          provides all the above information (fractional liver
          clearance, recovery during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout</TIMEX>, etc.).
        
        
          Methoxyflurane
          As shown by the results in figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> provides
          an accurate description of the human pharmacokinetics of
          the uptake and washout of enflurane and halothane and the
          uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> In contrast, the PKQuest
          predictions are clearly incorrect for methoxyflurane.
          Figures 4show the PKQuest predictions for the alveolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (solid line) compared with the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data of Carpenter et al.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>, left column) and Monson
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, right column). (See the additional file
          1for the complete methoxyflurane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> procedure). The
          partition coefficients used for these figures are the
          standard literature values: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.9</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fasted subjects</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kfwat</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . It can be seen that the PKQuest concentrations
          during uptake are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> less than the experimental
          values. The actual error is even worse than this because
          these PKQuest predictions ignore metabolism, which can
          account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 70%</NUMEX> of the total removal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 27</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 37 43</NUMEX> ] . Including metabolism would increase the
          difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> and experimental results
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">uptake</TIMEX>. The explanation for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> fit is
          provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Discussion</ENAMEX> section.
        
        
          Toluene
          Some of the most comprehensive and sophisticated human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPKs</ENAMEX> have been developed to describe the
          pharmacokinetics of volatile toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toluene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 44 45</NUMEX> ] , styrene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>
          chloride [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . The most involved models incorporate
          several different fat and muscle compartments with
          different flows and allow for changes with time in the
          blood flows as the subject's exercise level varies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . These studies have also introduced a Bayesian
          approach to determine the population distribution of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 47</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PKQuest</ENAMEX> cannot complete with
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPKs</ENAMEX> for this class of solutes. The only purpose
          of applying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to toluene is to show that the new
          approach developed here of using just klip and the
          oil/water partition coefficient to characterize the
          tissue partition is valid for a wider class of solutes
          than just the anesthetics <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> (at least as a first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> was applied to data for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (subjects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a and 15</TIMEX>) that were chosen from
          the detailed investigations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          because they had large differences in percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) and corresponding differences in toluene

          The total body weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wtot</ENAMEX>), body fat fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fat</ENAMEX>),
          blood/air partition coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX>) and alveolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX> (alvent) were measured for each individual
          subject (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ) and these
          values were used as input. The value of the lipid/air
          partition coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfair</ENAMEX>) was set equal to the
          average value determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> is not input, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> using Kbair
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kfbld</ENAMEX> and the default fat content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (klip
          [vein]). The input function was a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 hour</NUMEX> inhalation of
          toluene at a constant gas concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼M</NUMEX>. The only
          adjustable parameters are the metabolic kinetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat liver</ENAMEX> has a number of enzymes involved
          in toluene metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX> for all of
          these enzymes is in the mM range, while the blood toluene
          concentrations for this data are in the Î¼M range, it was
          assumed that the metabolism is linear which, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>,
          is indicated by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> (in place of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm and Km</ENAMEX>). The
          value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> was obtained by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX>
          minimization routine that is built into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to
          optimize the fit to the blood data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          divided the metabolism between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and lung.
          However, since there is little direct information about
          human lung metabolism of toluene, it was assumed here
          that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> was involved in the metabolism.
          Subject 5a was modeled using the same procedure using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">121 Kg</ENAMEX>), fat fraction (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.38</NUMEX>) alveolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kbair</ENAMEX> measured for this subject. (See
          the additional file 1for the complete subject 5a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>
          procedure). The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> for subject 5a was set
          equal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> of subject <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> scaled by body weight.
          All the other parameters were identical to those for
          subject <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the agreement between the PKQuest
          predictions for the arterial (black) and venous (red)
          blood concentration and the experimental data for subject
          5a (left hand column) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (right hand column) during
          the time course of toluene washout. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> allows an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">arbitrary</ENAMEX> number of different organ concentrations to be
          simultaneously displayed). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce et</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">al.</ENAMEX> sampled
          "arterialized" venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> venous and
          arterial concentrations are identical at the time points
          of the experimental data (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), the distinction
          between artery and vein is not significant. Figures 6show
          the corresponding fits for the alveolar gas
          concentration. It can be seen that the agreement is quite
          good and the differences in the pharmacokinetics for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> can be explained by differences in the fat
          fraction. It should be emphasized that there is only one
          adjustable parameter for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects - the Tclr</ENAMEX> of
          subject <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Perfusion-Ventilation Mismatch</ENAMEX>
          A unique feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is that it provides a
          direct simulation of the mismatch between perfusion and
          ventilation. A detailed description of the equations and
          procedures used for this simulation is provided in the
          original paper [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is divided into
          Nlung equal volume compartments, with the blood flow (Q)
          and ventilation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) to each compartment determined by a
          bivariate, uncorrelated, log-normal function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] ;
          
          The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX> is determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1dim</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX> = (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2*N1dim</TIMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters
          Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX> and Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> (the "log standard deviation")
          characterize the distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood perfusion</ENAMEX> (Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q</ENAMEX> ) and the ventilation (Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> ) to the different compartments of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. The default values of Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX> and Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> were determined by applying
          the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] to the
          ventilation-perfusion ratio distribution for normal young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . The rates of perfusion and ventilation to
          each lung compartment are assumed to be uncorrelated (see
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] for details). This assumption is consistent with
          recent direct measurements of regional perfusion and
          ventilation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . Results will be shown here for
          the case where the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> equal volume
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N1dim</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). This provides a
          good test of the importance of perfusion-ventilation
          mismatch. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Increasing N1dim</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX> and Ï 
          V the fraction of total flow and total

          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7shows</NUMEX> the influence of perfusion-ventilation
          mismatch on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> results for the enflurane data of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The predicted alveolar
          concentration is shown for a) the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> compartment
          homogenous lung model (black); and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> compartment
          model with b) the default (normal) values for sig_v and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sig_f</ENAMEX> (red); c) twice the normal values of sig_v and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sig_f</ENAMEX> (green); and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the normal values of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sig_v</ENAMEX> and sig_f (blue). It can be seen that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">compartment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with normal sig_v and sig_f (red) is
          almost indistinguishable from the homogeneous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">compartment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (black). Thus, normal values of
          perfusion-ventilation mismatch have no significant effect
          on the uptake and washout of enflurane. It is not until
          the normal values of sig_v and sig_f are increased by a
          factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> that differences become
          significant.
          Although the effect of the perfusion-ventilation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> is small, it can be important for some
          experimental measurements. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8shows</NUMEX> the alveolar

        Discussion and conclusions
        
          Enflurane, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrous oxide</ENAMEX>, halothane and
          toluene
          The simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> approach of using a single set of
          "standard human" values for the lipid fraction of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organ</ENAMEX> (klip) to predict tissue/blood partition provides
          an accurate prediction of the pharmacokinetics of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          volatile solute. The word "prediction" (and not
          "description") is purposely used here because most of the
          parameters are based on the default, previously
          determined set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> data and there is a minimum of
          adjustable parameters. For example, in the PKQuest input
          for the enflurane pharmacokinetics (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) there are no
          adjustable parameters. Every constant in the procedure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enflurane</ENAMEX>() listed above is pre-determined from previous
          measurements. In this sense, the time dependence of the
          alveolar enflurane concentration during washin and
          washout shown in fig. 1is a true prediction, based on
          previous measurements.
          This example for enflurane is slightly misleading
          because the default blood flow in "standard human" was
          adjusted to give the best fit to the enflurane data. The
          fat blood flow parameter plays an important role in
          determining the accuracy of the fit to the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9compares</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for enflurane
          using the default fat blood flow (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.056 liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>) and twice the default value (red). The generality
          of this fat blood flow value is evidenced by the good fit
          that was obtained when it was used in the modeling of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson et al.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> et al. data for halothane
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> et al. data for toluene (figs.
          5and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), solutes for which the fat blood flow has a
          larger influence because of the larger value of the
          oil/water partition coefficient.
          This use of the enflurane data to determine the fat
          blood flow illustrates one of the main advantages of
          having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> that is general
          enough that it can be applied to a large variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solutes</ENAMEX>. Since different solutes have different
          sensitivities to the different PBPK parameters, using a
          variety of solutes to optimize the parameters increases
          the validity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. Other examples of PKQuest
          standard human parameters that were optimized this way
          are the muscle blood flow (optimized using human D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ) and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extracellular</ENAMEX> space (optimized using human inulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ).
          The single most important difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>
          and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBPKs</ENAMEX> that have been applied to these solutes
          is the way the tissue/blood partition coefficient is
          handled. The conventional approach is to directly measure
          this partition coefficient for each solute in various
          classes of tissue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and then use these values
          in the human model. In contrast, in PKQuest this
          partition coefficient is determined just from the value
          of the oil/water partition coefficient (along with the
          default value of the organ and blood lipid content).
          Since this partition coefficient is a simple physical
          chemical value and is usually available in the
          literature, this means that one can apply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to
          solutes even when no animal tissue partition data is
          available. The ability of this approach to describe the
          pharmacokinetics of solutes with an oil/water partition
          varying from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120</NUMEX> (toluene) demonstrates the
          large range of its validity.
          The pharmacokinetic approach that seems to be
          currently favored for anesthetics is to use a general
          multi-compartment fit rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 55</NUMEX> ] . In
          this approach, the data is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fit with a
          multi-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exponential</NUMEX> function that is then interpreted in
          terms of exchanges between a central compartment (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>) and an adjustable number of peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> (a "mammillary" system). Although this
          approach may be mathematically similar to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>, it is
          completely different philosophically. The advantage of
          the multi-compartment approach is that it is completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> and puts no restrictions or previous assumptions
          on the pharmacokinetic model. This advantage is also its
          main disadvantage. For example in a multi-compartment
          analysis of anesthetics by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yasuda et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] there are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different rate constants that are optimized for each
          different anesthetic and these constants are then
          interpreted in terms of compartments and flows. In
          contrast, the major design feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is to have
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> parameters as possible set by default based on
          previously determined measurements, with the amount of
          user input reduced to its absolute minimum. For the case
          of the typical volatile solute described here, the user
          only needs to input the water/air and oil/water partition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> and the metabolic parameters. All the other
          parameters required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> (organ volumes, blood
          flows, alveolar ventilation, organ/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood partition</ENAMEX> and
          volume, etc.) are determined simply by a call to
          "standardhuman". By using all the previous information
          that is available to restrict the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and minimize the
          number of adjustable parameters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> greatly
          increases the predictive power of the analysis.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception to the generally good agreement
          between the PKQuest predictions and the experimental data
          for these solutes is for the washout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Although the differences
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> and experimental data are small in
          absolute value, they represent large relative values. For
          example, for the last data point (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>), the
          PKQuest prediction for the end expired gas concentration
          is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.067%</NUMEX> while the experimental value is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.026%</NUMEX> (for an
          inhaled concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.88%</NUMEX>). (This difference is
          larger than the standard error of the last data point.)
          This difference may be artifactual. For example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experimental N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> data (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) has a marked
          difference in the degree of equilibrium reached during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX>) versus washout (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.7%</NUMEX>). This result is not
          expected theoretically and is not consistent with the
          detailed experimental results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamitre et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ]
          who found approximately equal equilibration times during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> and washout of sub anesthetic doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> Another indication of the problem
          presented by this discrepancy is that it was not possible
          to significantly improve the fit by adjusting any or all
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> parameters. Any parameter change that
          improved the fit for the washout, significantly worsened
          the fit for the uptake and the addition of a
          perfusion-ventilation mismatch did not improve the fit.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation is a small error in the
          quantitative measurements (made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munsen et al</ENAMEX>
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] at low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> concentrations. Other
          possibilities are a difference in some physiological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (e.g. ventilation) during uptake and washout
          or an error in reading the data off the published linear
          plot.
        
        
          Methoxyflurane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methoxyflurane</ENAMEX> is a notable exception to the generally
          good agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest PBPK</ENAMEX> and the
          experimental data. For methoxyflurane, the experimental
          end tidal partial pressure (squares, fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX>
          greater than the PKQuest prediction during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">uptake</TIMEX> (line,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). It is assumed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that the
          arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and alveolar gas partial pressures are
          equal and correspond to the experimentally measured end
          tidal gas partial pressure. Thus the error in fig. 4is
          equivalent to the statement that "the arterial partial
          pressure is significantly less than the end tidal partial
          pressure". This discrepancy for methoxyflurane had been
          noted previously in the older literature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holaday et</ENAMEX> al.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] reported that during methoxyflurane uptake, the
          arterial partial pressure was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 50%</NUMEX> of the end
          expired value. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stoelting</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] observed that
          at the end of the methoxyflurane uptake, the arterial
          partial pressure was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the end expired, while during
          washout, the two values were nearly identical. Despite
          these clear indications that there was something
          anomalous about methoxyflurane, this problem seems to
          have been generally ignored in the recent literature.
          This inequality is almost certainly caused by the
          classic "washin-washout" artifact that has been described
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> with large blood/air partition (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 59 60 61 62 63 64 65</NUMEX> ] . This artifact
          is created when, during inspiration, the high
          concentration gas dissolves in the tissues of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bronchial tree</ENAMEX>, and then, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">expiration</TIMEX>, moves back
          into the air, raising the end tidal concentration above
          the alveolar values. For extremely soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutes</ENAMEX> such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1756</TIMEX>), the expired gas concentration
          is dominated by exchange with the conducting airway and
          is almost independent of the alveolar concentration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> of intermediate solubility, such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">styrene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>) or toluene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>) the effect
          is less dramatic and has often been overlooked. This
          analysis provides a good example of the advantage of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBPK</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> over the more general compartmental
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mamillary</NUMEX>) model. It is obvious from the PKQuest
          analysis (see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) that some model assumption must be
          wrong. In contrast, in a detailed compartmental
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mammillary</NUMEX>) model analysis of the simultaneous uptake
          and washout of methoxyflurane and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> it was
          recognized that methoxyflurane was different, but the
          "reason for this discrepancy is not clear" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] .
          The strongest evidence supporting this explanation for
          the discrepancy in the methoxyflurane data is provided by
          a comparison with toluene. Since the blood/air partition
          coefficients are similar for toluene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methoxyflurane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.9</NUMEX>), this artifact should be of
          similar magnitude for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two solutes</TIMEX>. During the
          uptake of toluene in resting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, the end tidal
          partial pressure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 1/2</NUMEX> the arterial value [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> ] , similar to what is observed for methoxyflurane ( [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 68</NUMEX> ] , and see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, when these same
          subjects begin to exercise, increasing the ventilatory
          rate by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX>, the arterial and end tidal gas
          concentrations become approximately equal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] .
          Presumably, at the higher rates of ventilation, there is
          relatively less time for exchange with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX>, and
          the artifact decreases. This suggests that solutes such
          as methoxyflurane or toluene are right on the boundary of
          where this artifact becomes important. The artifact
          becomes negligible for halothane with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> as
          indicated by the nearly identical end tidal and arterial
          partial pressures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] , and the good agreement between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> results and the experimental data (see fig.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          For solutes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toluene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 67</NUMEX> ] , styrene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ]
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methoxyflurane</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] there is, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, a
          peculiar asymmetry in the data that has caused some
          confusion: during uptake there is a large difference in
          the end tidal and arterial partial pressures, while,
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout</TIMEX>, there is only a small or negligible
          difference. However, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">asymmetry</ENAMEX> disappears if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is reexamined as follows: For the resting toluene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data of Carlsson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] during uptake the inspired
          concentration is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 mg/m 3</ENAMEX>, the end tidal concentration
          is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3</ENAMEX>, and the arterial concentration is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">585 mg/m</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Assuming a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, this arterial concentration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a gas concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3</ENAMEX>, an end
          tidal - arterial difference of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>. If the artifact were
          not present and the end tidal equaled the arterial, then
          the end tidal concentration should have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/m 3</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, the net rate of gas uptake (inspired - end tidal)
          is decreased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13%</NUMEX> (= (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72-32</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/300</NUMEX>) by the artifact.
          If a symmetrical error was present during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout</TIMEX>, the
          washout rate should also be decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> by the
          artifact. Since, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout</TIMEX>, the inspired
          concentration is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, this means that the washout end
          tidal concentration should be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> less than the arterial
          partial pressure. Thus, if the artifact was symmetrical,
          the difference between the end tidal and arterial partial
          pressure during washout should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 1/5</NUMEX> of the
          difference during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">uptake</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> difference).
          Errors of this magnitude (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) can be swamped by the
          normal variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kbair</ENAMEX> that result from variations in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood fat</ENAMEX> content.
          The observant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> should, at this point, be asking
          why toluene can be modeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">figs. 5and 6</ENAMEX>) if
          it has a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Kbair and</ENAMEX>, therefore, similar
          washin-washout artifact as methoxyflurane. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Only the washout data was modeled so that one
          would expect only a small (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) error; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) This small
          error in the washout data was not present because the
          value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbair</ENAMEX> that was used for this modeling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ) was determined from the
          experimental ratios of the blood/end tidal air for each
          subject, and, thus, automatically compensated for this
          artifact. The fact that the average value of this "in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kbair</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX> larger than the "in vitro"
          value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] is consistent with an end tidal partial
          pressure that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> less than the arterial partial
          pressure.
