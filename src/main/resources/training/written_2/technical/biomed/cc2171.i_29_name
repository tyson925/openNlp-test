        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 750 000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
        suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. Treatment for this <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16.7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Despite advances in supportive
        intensive care and use of appropriate antibiotics, the
        mortality associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> remains high, especially
        among those who develop hemodynamic shock [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> frequently progress to multiple organ dysfunction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, which results in a much higher mortality rate
        than among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who do not develop such complications [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . This life-threatening <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> is largely
        attributed to the cardiovascular abnormalities associated
        with septic shock, requiring supportive therapy (e.g.
        mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasopressors</ENAMEX>) with volume loading, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery, and
        regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, there are still many
        controversies regarding choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasopressors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] , hemodynamic end-points for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuscitation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] , and monitoring
        techniques. Findings from a national survey of intensive
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU) utilization showed differences in types of
        procedures performed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit types</ENAMEX> and hospital sizes
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The goals of the present study were to examine
        systematically the variations in overall resource use,
        therapeutic modality use, and outcome in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> across academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and to
        evaluate relationships between therapeutic modality use and
        variation in resource use.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Patient population
          All participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic</ENAMEX>
          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center Consortium</ENAMEX>, which sponsored the study. All
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> were large tertiary care academic medical
          centers with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 18 800-43 700</NUMEX> admissions
          annually [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Patient enrollment occurred between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1993 and April 1994</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> surveyed represented a stratified random
          sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> and outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> for whom
          blood cultures were either positive or negative, as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Among non-ICU <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          blood cultures that were negative at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, sampling
          at all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> was fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a blood culture positive for a pathogen
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> sampled was
          established at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and varied from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% to 60%</NUMEX>. In
          addition, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died in an emergency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received a
          novel therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> were surveyed. The ICUs
          involved included both open and closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
          Although previous reports included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1342</NUMEX> episodes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1166</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1190</NUMEX> hospital
          admissions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] , the results presented here from
          the same database were based on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1011</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          representing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1028</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) admissions with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1173</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>)
          episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>, for whom billing information
          was available. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> episode in
          an admission, only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> episode in that admission
          was evaluated.
        
        
          Definitions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> was defined as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sands</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , using a modification of the criteria
          developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and involved assessment of the
          presence of both screening criteria and confirmatory
          criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>. Either of the following
          were required for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to satisfy the screening
          criteria: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> of temperature greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38.3°C</TIMEX> or
          less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35.6°C</TIMEX> rectally, respirations greater than
          20/min or mechanical ventilation, heart rate greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> beats/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>, and clinical evidence of infection; or one
          or more blood cultures positive for a pathogen at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> following admission. Presence of any of the
          following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> features, without an alternative cause,
          was required for satisfaction of the confirmatory
          criteria: ratio of partial arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> tension to
          inspired fractional oxygen below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">280</NUMEX> (intubated) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          face mask in use (nonintubated); arterial pH below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.30</NUMEX>;
          urine output below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/h; systolic blood pressure below
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 mmHg</TIMEX> or a fall in systolic blood pressure by more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mmHg</ENAMEX> sustained for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> despite fluid challenge;
          systemic vascular resistance below <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800 dynes·s/cm 5</ENAMEX>;
          prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time greater
          than normal or platelets below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100.0 × 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/l</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX> decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> or most recent
          measurement before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">current day</TIMEX>; and documentation of
          deterioration in mental status within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. In
          addition, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received a form of novel
          therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> were enrolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syndrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Because all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>
          also meet the criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'severe sepsis</ENAMEX>' (the term that
          is most popular now), below we use the term 'severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sepsis</ENAMEX>'.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX> (ARDS) was defined
          as partial arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> tension below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mmHg despite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractional</ENAMEX> inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, and
          bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without signs of heart
          failure. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was
          defined as a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dimer or elevated fibrin
          degradation products plus a falling platelet count of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
          of less of baseline, and elevation of either prothrombin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> or partial prothrombin time, or clinical evidence of
          bleeding. Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction was
          defined as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glasgow Coma</ENAMEX> Scale score below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with normal results at baseline neurologic
          examination, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> point lower than baseline in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a previously abnormal examination result.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Renal failure</ENAMEX> was defined as an increase in serum
          creatinine of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
          episode if creatinine was below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl at baseline, or
          an absolute increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl or more if baseline
          creatinine was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1.5</NUMEX>. Liver failure was defined as
          present if total bilirubin was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl or greater, and
          either the alkaline phosphatase or a transaminase level
          was greater than twice normal, in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">confounding disease</ENAMEX>. Shock (after onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>) was
          defined as either <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least 1 hour</NUMEX> of decreased systolic
          blood pressure by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 40</NUMEX> mmHg, or systolic blood
          pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 mmHg or less</NUMEX> after adequate volume
          replacement, and in the absence of antihypertensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, or continuous infusion of pressors. Uncontrolled
          hemorrhage was defined as active and live-threatening
          bleeding, requiring transfusions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4</NUMEX> units
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. Moderate or severe
          liver disease was defined as cirrhosis with portal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypertension</ENAMEX>, or hepatic failure with coma or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalopathy</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding 6 months</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surveyors</ENAMEX> recorded the presence of all screening
          criteria for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was a valid member
          of the surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. If screening criteria were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">met</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was enrolled as a case and detailed
          information, including demographic, historical, clinical
          and laboratory data, were abstracted from the medical
          record into a standardized data collection form for which
          all variables and criteria were defined. Additional data,
          including information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use, treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modalities</ENAMEX> (pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>] use,
          ventilator support, pressor support, albumin infusion,
          het-astarch, and dextran), complications (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, renal
          failure, liver failure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIC</ENAMEX>, and shock), and associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, were abstracted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> after the first onset
          of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> or at the time of death or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discharge</ENAMEX>, whichever came first. Hospital length of stay
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>) before and after the onset of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> charge were obtained from the unified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic Medical Center Consortium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> billing
          database.
          We calculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlson</ENAMEX> comorbidity score
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ; a higher score reflects greater comorbidity. We
          also obtained information on discharge diagnosis-relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (DRGs) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> weight. The current generation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX> was originally based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICD-9-CM</ENAMEX> and takes into
          consideration operations, complications, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comorbidities</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> was preassigned an average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>
          and reimbursement rate by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Health Care Financing</ENAMEX>
          Administration. The higher the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> weight, the higher the
          level of reimbursement.
        
        
          Analyses
          Because the sampling fractions from different strata
          varied [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , individual cases carried different weight
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and all calculations, including means and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proportions</ENAMEX>, were performed using appropriate case
          weights.
          We compared the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          receiving each intervention therapy and then the
          proportion with complications among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> academic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, using weighted χ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2statistics</TIMEX>. We also calculated
          the ratio of the highest to lowest proportion for each
          intervention and complication. Multivariate comparisons
          were made using generalized linear modeling, with
          post-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> and hospital charges as dependent
          variables and study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (coded as dummy variables) as
          the main covariate, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson
          comorbidity score, discharge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> weight, organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, uncontrolled hemorrhage, moderate or
          severe liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX> (surgical versus medical) at onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. The
          same adjustment of variables was applied in logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> models to compare the likelihood that a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> received an intervention
          and experienced a complication, arbitrarily choosing
          center <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> as the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Because patients
          within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> could share some common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, generalized estimating equation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were used to perform the analyses on
          the comparisons of resource use between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with and
          without use of modalities. The 
          r 2value was calculated for each
          model. All analyses were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          statistical package (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Variation in resource use
          There was significant variation in mean total charges
          among admissions with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> among the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, varying from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$65 162</NUMEX> (median <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42 802</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$244</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> (median <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$181 758</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The mean post-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>
          varied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16.1 days to 24.8 days</TIMEX> (median range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>) among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. Other measures of resource
          utilization including total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> were
          also significantly different across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, with means
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36.9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, respectively. After
          adjusting for age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlson</ENAMEX> comorbidity score,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discharge DRG</ENAMEX> weight, organ dysfunction, and service at
          onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, the variations in mean total charges and
          post-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> remained significant, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$69</NUMEX> 429
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9562 to $237 898 ± $12 129</NUMEX>, and from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15.9 ± 2.0</NUMEX> days
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.2</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.8 days</TIMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Variation in therapeutic modality use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interventions</ENAMEX> used frequently after the onset of
          severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> included PACs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.4%</NUMEX>), ventilator support
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.8%</NUMEX>), pressor support (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.8%</NUMEX>), and albumin infusion
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.4%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Although there were variations across
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> for each therapeutic modality, variation

          Comparisons of resource use among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated

          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of antibiotics within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after
          sepsis onset had no impact on any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> categories,

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Use of other modalities (including albumin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infusion</ENAMEX>) was associated with increased resource use for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> charges. Total hospital charges and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> were significantly higher among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
          given pressor support and/or albumin infusion after onset
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> as compared with those who were not. Increased
          post-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> were associated with
          use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PACs</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were found between total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modalities</ENAMEX> studied.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Overall, we found moderate variation in resource and
        therapeutic modality use among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe sepsis
        in academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. In general, this variation had little
        relationship to clinical outcomes, although clinical
        outcomes varied substantially between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The
        exception is that, even adjusting for potential
        confounders, early antibiotic therapy was associated with a
        lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality rate. Increased use of some of the
        therapeutic modalities was associated with greater resource
        utilization.
        Prior studies have shown variability in the use of
        therapeutic modalities (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PACs</ENAMEX>, ventilator, and
        intravenous vasoactive and inotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>) among ICU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 27</NUMEX> ] and different impacts on outcomes and
        use of hospital resources associated with these treatments
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 28 29</NUMEX> ] . In general, with the exception of the
        recent trial demonstrating benefit of early goal-directed
        treatment involving oxygenation (including ventilatory
        support if necessary) and blood pressure (including
        intravenous pressors if necessary) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , few data are
        available that demonstrate that these modalities improve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colloids</ENAMEX> and crystalloid are equally effective in
        restoring tissue perfusion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . However, the choice of fluid has considerable cost
        implications: colloids cost more for volume replacement.
        Largely inappropriate use of colloids was found in a survey
        of academic health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> despite guidelines from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> recommending that colloids be used in
        hemorrhagic shock only until blood products become
        available, and in nonhemorrhagic shock only if an initial
        infusion with crystalloid is insufficient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . A
        recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials
        comparing colloids and crystalloid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> for volume
        replacement found that resuscitation with colloids in
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was actually associated with an
        increased risk of mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasopressors</ENAMEX> have been recommended to
        achieve end-points of hemodynamic, and normal or
        supranormal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> transport variables in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume therapy.
        However, after reviewing the literature on the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasopressors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudis</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] found that catecholamine therapy
        resulting in increased hemodynamic and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> transport
        measures did not change the overall mortality, with the
        exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> instances in which epinephrine
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">adrenaline</NUMEX>) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) were given
        alone after volume repletion. The results from a recent
        trial of low-dose dopamine in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, who
        had systemic inflammatory response <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> and were at
        risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>, did not show benefit in renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> and survival from the treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        However, a very recent trial of early goal-directed therapy
        in treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> did demonstrate substantial
        improvement in outcome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Another technology is monitoring central pressures by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>, which is often used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> to assess the effect of
        pharmacotherapy on the cardiac index in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        septic shock. This is done even though the efficacy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> has never been demonstrated convincingly in a large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trial. A number of randomized
        controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of PACs
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-guided strategies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 35 36</NUMEX> ] and other specific patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 37 38 39</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] , with conflicting results. A recent case mix
        adjusted observational study of a large sample of ICU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> use was associated with increased
        risk for mortality and resource use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        Mechanical ventilation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> has been
        reported to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and lung injury [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . Properly constructed trials are still
        needed to define the best use of mechanical ventilation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sepsis</ENAMEX>, although early ventilatory support was a component
        of the recent early goal-directed intervention by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivers</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Use of some therapeutic modalities does appear
        correlated with organizational characteristics. For
        example, results from a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> survey conducted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greoger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] showed that more technologies
        were used in surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> as compared with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
        as well as in larger versus smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and in
        university-affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. In addition, a large
        prospective multicenter study evaluated the differences in
        ICU characteristics and performance among teaching and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonteaching</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . The results of that study
        revealed more frequent use of monitoring and therapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>, and greater resource utilization in teaching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital ICUs</ENAMEX>. Also, a recent report from a large
        retrospective database study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        confirmed that organizational characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> use. In addition, that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> indicated that economic incentives and insurance
        coverage, as well as clinical variables, were associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> use. Similarly, much of the variation in resource
        use and modality use across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the present study
        may not be due to patient-related factors, but rather to
        organizational factors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> beliefs.
        We did find a number of relationships between modality
        use and resource utilization. In particular, there were
        associations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PACs</ENAMEX>,
        pressor support, and albumin infusion. These may probably
        be accounted for in part by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        longer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> were more likely to be treated with
        supportive technologies. In general, however, modalities
        with higher variation profiles reflect areas of greater
        disagreement in terms of treatment decision-making. Such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> may be fertile for additional investigation.
        It is striking that delay in antibiotic therapy was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a higher mortality rate and that some
        delays were present in this very ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Delays are
        common in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] , even in urgent
        situations such as treatment of life-threatening laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Although we do not know the causes
        of delays in antibiotic initiation, they appeared more
        common in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> than in others. We speculate
        that some may have occurred because of problems related to
        crowding; for example, emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> might have
        been full, resulting in delayed transfer, or the clinical
        importance of changes in vital signs might not have been
        recognized. Approaches such as protocols for early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> and treatment of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and
        facilitation of medication orders that are really needed
        urgently may be helpful. Guidelines for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> are probably most applicable for certain
        treatment modalities, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PACs</ENAMEX>, albumin, dextran, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hetastarch</ENAMEX>. Even use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">organ failure</ENAMEX> treatment modalities
        such as ventilator support and renal replacement therapies
        might be different if such guidelines were developed.
        An important underlying issue is why variation occurs [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] . It should not be surprising that it is present in
        this domain, because the pioneering work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wennberg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ]
        identified variation across a broad array of domains. One
        of the major causes of variation is probably physician
        uncertainty regarding what interventions are truly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>, and clinician beliefs, where training occurred,
        and regional practices probably also play roles.
        Uncertainty may be especially problematic in conditions
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, in which mortality is high, and clinicians
        strongly want to do everything possible. Variation is
        likely to diminish as more evidence becomes available and
        is brought to the point of care. Analysis of variation can
        be very useful for identifying areas of high uncertainty [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] .
        This study has a number of limitations. We had
        information only on hospital charges, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        costs. We did not have information on organizational
        variables such as organizational setting, staffing, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of practices, and the study included only
        academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. Also, our data did not include the
        indications for use of therapeutic modalities.
        In conclusion, significant variations were present in
        hospital resource use and patient outcome among sepsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. In general,
        variation in therapeutic modality use did not correlate
        with clinical outcomes, suggesting that some use of these
        modalities may be of limited value, and that further
        evaluation of these modalities is warranted. The exception
        was that delay in giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality rate. Approaches
        to eliminate these delays may improve outcomes.

        Key messages
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">• Moderate</ENAMEX> variation in resource use and use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> was present in treatment of severe sepsis
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX> centers
        • This variation presisted even after adjusting for
        potential confounders
        • Increased use of some therapeutic modalities such as
        albumin infusion was associated with greater resource
        utilization
        • Among therapeutic modalities, only early antibiotic
        use was associated with lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality
        • Taken together, these data suggest that some
        therapeutic modalities may be of limited value in sepsis
        treatment and that further evaluation is warranted
