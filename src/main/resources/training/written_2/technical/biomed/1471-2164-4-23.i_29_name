        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have proven to be a particularly
        effective tool for genome-wide transcript profiling, and
        they can generate information on the accumulation and
        disappearance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of specific transcripts in a
        single experiment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Because such an array
        generates vast quantities of data, it is desirable to
        improve the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reliability</ENAMEX> of the data through
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitions</ENAMEX>. Additionally, it is useful to
        perform time course experiments involving multiple time
        points to enable the application of cluster analysis to
        classify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes exhibiting similar temporal
        patterns of regulation in response to shifts in
        environmental conditions. Therefore, a robust experimental
        design may involve the consumption of many individual DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. Given these considerations, it is important to
        have methods for improving the efficiency and economy of
        microarray production.
        Since the bacterial genes are typically not cloned at a
        genome-wide scale as non-redundant, ordered sets, as with
        eukaryotic cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, it is not possible to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'universal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. T3, T7 sequences</ENAMEX>) and therefore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">amplification</ENAMEX> requires design and synthesis of PCR
        primers for all target genes. In this context, the
        construction of bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> from genomic
        sequence data using a 'two-stage' approach, is attractive
        because it allows the continued re-amplification of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> and facilitates further utilization of the DNA
        fragments for additional uses (e.g. over-expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This approach involves the use of chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primers</ENAMEX> containing both gene-specific and engineered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (adaptamers). These primers are used to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesize PCR</ENAMEX> products directly from genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which
        serves as template during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage of PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. This amplification can be performed for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> production run using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-established</ENAMEX> procedures that include microtiter plates
        and multichannel pipetting techniques to afford efficient
        parallel processing of the samples. The products of this
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage of amplification are gene sequences flanked by
        the arbitrary adaptamer sequences engineered into the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stage PCR</ENAMEX> primers. The adaptamer sequences become the basis
        for re-amplification of the gene sequences in a second
        stage amplification. During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stage of
        amplification, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products serve as
        template, whereas a single pair of primers recognizing the
        flanking adaptamer sequence can be used to re-amplify all
        products of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
        In this report, we describe the procedures for the
        production and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> for the
        cyanobacterium 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC6803</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        is a widely used experimental model for the study of gene
        expression and plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC6803</ENAMEX> was predicted
        to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,168</NUMEX> open reading frames (prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2002</TIMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kazusa</ENAMEX>.or.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">jp/cyano/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Of these,
        over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> ORFs) have been characterized as
        hypothetical or having no similarity to known sequences.
        Thus, differential gene expression via microarray analysis
        will represent an important functional genomics approach
        and we describe the two-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> strategy that led to the
        successful production of full-genome microarray for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> .

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC6803</ENAMEX> cultures were
          grown autotrophically in BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> medium essentially as
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Specifically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mL
          cultures were grown in flat (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cm across the light path)
          Bellco tissue culture flasks at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30Â°C</TIMEX> under white light
          fluorescent illumination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cool White Â®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>)

          Chimeric oligonucleotide design and PCR
          amplification
          Figure 1provides a flow chart of the preparation of
          the full-genome 
          Synechocystis microarray.
          Oligonucleotides, synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> Genosys
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sigmagenosys</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/</ENAMEX>, were designed to amplify
          the complete coding region of each open reading frame
          from the sequenced genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC6803</ENAMEX>. The only
          exceptions were instances for genes with a predicted
          length extending beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,168</NUMEX> open reading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 10%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">261</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were truncated
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb limit. Each of the oligos is a
          chimeric sequence designed for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round synthesis and,
          as such, contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components: a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' universal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' gene-specific sequence as shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The gene-specific region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> begins at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or last base of the
          open reading frame and continues inside until the T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of the oligo was in the range of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58-62Â°C</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-45</NUMEX> nt, including the universal sequence). An
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Genosys</ENAMEX>) based upon Primer3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>) was used for this purpose and resulted in a
          high frequency of successful amplification as discussed
          below. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the universal sequences were designed
          to include 
          SapI restriction sites in order to
          facilitate downstream applications, including cloning
          into an expression vector. Aliquots of the
          oligonucleotides were transferred and mixed as primer
          pairs to separate locations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates prior to
          delivery from the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, which facilitated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format. The remaining
          products from the synthesis reaction were stored in
          individual tubes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> round amplifications were performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well

          Labeled cDNA production
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled cDNA was produced using a

          The slides were boiled in deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX>
          to denature the printed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, dried using low speed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> in a specialized microscope
          slide-accommodating rotor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telechem</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> on the
          microarray was then subjected to a UV-cross-linking at a
          dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>. Prehybridization was performed by
          incubating the slide in a fresh mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>

        Results and Discussion
        The goal of this project was to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
        as part of an overall strategy for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX> in
        the unicellular model cyanobacterium, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC6803</ENAMEX>. The two-stage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> strategy (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) was adopted as a means to
        facilitate replication of the arrays as needs dictated
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In general terms, the optimization of this
        technical approach required particular attention to the
        design of the adaptamers, the choice and use of the
        thermostable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, and the thermocycling
        conditions. Other technical factors, such as the array
        printing conditions, were found to conform to observations
        that are well-described in the literature. Overall, the
        rate-limiting production steps following the reaction
        optimization were those involving the analysis of the
        products. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1outlines</NUMEX> the main features of this
        successful construction project and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1highlights</ENAMEX> some
        of the key parameters that we tested during the array
        construction.
        Critical design features of the chimeric <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
        primers were the inclusion of the directional cloning and
        expression features, plus the inclusion of a good common
        template sequence for the subsequent <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. The adaptamers included the introduction of
        G+C rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' termini to stabilize the end
        structure of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products. Another
        important design aspect that proved critical, according to
        our preliminary tests, was incorporation of an additional
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C rich overhang in the universal primers used
        for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The absence of the
        additional sequences resulted in very poor PCR performance
        compared to the excellent performance observed with their
        inclusion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the two-stage amplification had the
        unanticipated advantage of normalizing the yield of PCR
        products across the entire set of genes, such that lower
        than average yielding products from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stround PCR
        (using the gene specific sequence and chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>) often had a robust yield during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndround of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> using the common adaptamer sequences.
        Although the primers were deliberately designed in such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> that oligo T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m 's</ENAMEX> fell in narrow range, it was
        determined after a number of trials that it was necessary
        to use 'touchdown' PCR conditions for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the percentage of successful
        products after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round synthesis appeared quite
        low, based on yield as visualized in the ethidium stained
        electrophoretic gels. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> showed little to no
        product or multiple products after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
        amplification with the chimeric primers. However, these
        products generally resulted in successful amplification
        after their use as template in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> when the universal sequences introduced as
        overhangs of the chimeric primers during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
        amplification were used. Thus, the universal primers in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round amplification provided the additional benefit
        of generating consistent yields across most of the genes
        (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Apparently, the amount of correct template
        produced by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stround <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, albeit often invisible
        during gel analysis, was usually sufficient to give high
        yields during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndround of amplification using the
        common adaptamer sequences. Thus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> of the products were
        successfully amplified during our initial round of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">two-stage PCR</ENAMEX>. Primers for the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> unsuccessful products
        were redesigned and synthesized, so that essentially all of
        the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were successfully amplified. Therefore,
        we conclude that this two-stage amplification strategy for
        the purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplifying multiple products for genome
        scale applications is highly successful, robust and
        efficient.
        The use of adaptamer sequences with identical T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m 's</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndround of amplification
        optimized the yields, despite different product lengths and
        different template concentrations (which were dependent on
        the yield from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round reactions). The enzyme and
        thermocycling conditions were also optimized. The choice of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Platinum</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfx</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) as the polymerase
        was determined to be crucial as was its use in conjunction
        with the proprietary reaction enhancer solution supplied
        with the buffer. Tests with alternatives, including mixes
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> and 
        Pfu , yielded less satisfactory
        results. All the images for the analysis of the PCR
        amplification are available at:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://microbiology.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">okstate</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/faculty/burnap/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> and quality control were emphasized
        throughout production of the microarrays to ensure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformity</ENAMEX> and accuracy. A semi-automated gel analysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">procedure</ENAMEX> scored products on the basis of size and absence
        of multiplicity. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were documented by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> photography and the images <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quantitatively</ENAMEX> analyzed
        using 
        Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labâ¢ Phoretics</ENAMEX> gel analysis
        software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonlinear Dynamics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>). This
        application was found to be most accurate, user-friendly,
        and efficiently handled dual tier gels. Furthermore, as
        with other packages, it allowed simple export of the
        numerical results to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> spreadsheets. A database was
        developed to integrate information, including gene
        sequences, oligonucleotide design, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product length, etc.
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macros</ENAMEX> were developed to transform the
        aforementioned information to produce lists for each plate,
        which were then used to track and identify the location of
        the arrayed elements under any condition, including the use
        of different array configurations. The scoring system,
        described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section, was set up
        to identify successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplified products.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA purification</ENAMEX> was simply and efficiently performed
        using filtration-type purification plates. Early issues
        with variation in printed spot morphology were resolved by
        pre-rinsing the filters: apparently this removes material
        acting as a surfactant and effects the spot morphology
        and/or drying characteristics. Alternatives such as ethanol
        or isopropanol precipitations were explored, but for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen PCR</ENAMEX> conditions, produced less reliable results and
        appeared to cause the co-precipitation of non-DNA material
        that interfered with downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. The nature of
        this material remains undefined, although it may be due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction proprietary enhancer that
        is supplied with the 
        Pfx polymerase. The concentrations of
        the purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments were determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devices Spectramax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qiagen Bio-Robot 3000</ENAMEX> was
        used to dilute the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/Î¼l</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2X</TIMEX> spotting
        solution. Tests showed that the combination of Superamine
        slides and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSP</ENAMEX> printing buffer solution from Telechem
        provided the best combination of spot morphology, retention
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> after processing of slides and signal-to-noise ratio
        after hybridization. Alternately, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Clontech type II</ENAMEX> slides
        in combination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telechem</ENAMEX> spotting buffer also gave
        good results in terms of printing and hybridization
        results. Tests with other buffer systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> 6X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>, gave less satisfactory results under the
        specified printing conditions. The synthesis and
        hybridization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> derived
        from sample <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        In order to generate uniform spot morphology and to
        maximize DNA concentration and consistency for each spot
        across the array, all products were printed at the same
        concentration. This was accomplished using the Qiagen
        Bio-robot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3000â¢</NUMEX> to resuspend each of the purified PCR
        products to the same concentration, based on the results of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectramax UV</ENAMEX> analysis. These products were then mixed
        with an equal volume of 2X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSP</ENAMEX> printing buffer from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telechem</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliquots</ENAMEX> were transferred via the
        Bio-robot to separate printing plates. The use of this
        robotic transfer reduced the chance for human error,
        increased the rate of transfer (thus reducing the exposure
        of the products to desiccation), and increased the
        reproducibility of the transfer. Syto-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> staining was
        regularly used to maintain a high level of quality control
        during the printing process.
        Several internal and external comparisons were analyzed
        to demonstrate the effective use of the arrays. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Internally,</ENAMEX>
        the use of triplicate spotting of all array elements and
        distribution of the triplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in different
        regions of the array allows the comparison of hybridization
        uniformity across the array, as depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
        Initially, we determined the effectiveness of printed
        slides by hybridization with total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from control and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX>-stressed cells. The results were compared with that of
        the published report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanesaki et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Similar
        patterns of regulation of specific transcripts were
        observed and several examples of the differentially
        regulated genes are indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Qualitatively
        similar results using a direct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-dye coupling procedure
        can be achieved using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Micromaxâ¢ ASAP RNA Labeling Kit</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin Elmer Life Sciences</ENAMEX>, Inc. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>. No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MPS544</NUMEX>)
        following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s suggested protocol. While it
        is significantly quicker and requires less manipulation,
        the direct chemical labeling kit is more expensive, and
        produces a final <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA product</ENAMEX> which is less stable than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> produced. Significantly direct labeling has thus far
        not provided as high a hybridization signal-to-noise ratio
        compared to the chemical coupling to cDNA approach.
        Substantial effort was devoted to ensure spot
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformity</ENAMEX>, high signal-to-noise ratio, and good
        statistical reproducibility. We believe that we have met
        these objectives, and these arrays relate favorably to the
        best of current prokaryotic and eukaryotic arrays. The
        strengths of these 
        Synechocystis arrays include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.)
        consistent and high DNA concentrations in each of over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> spots per array; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 replicates per</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> per
        slide; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.) high signal-to-noise ratio. This last
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> is due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both</TIMEX> to the quality of the slides, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> procedures that we utilized and the quality
        of the products printed. We have used these arrays to
        develop robust statistical tools for the analysis of the
        microarray data. The analysis involves an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that
        makes excellent use of the technical replicates designed
        into each slide and a loop design (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McIntyre</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). The availability of large
        quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the ability to print many slides and the
        statistical tools will enable us to analyze transcriptional
        changes under many environmental conditions and for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>. The two-stage amplification procedure also
        provides full gene copies for techniques like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>-fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagensis</ENAMEX>. This will permit many comparisons among
        different conditions and should greatly facilitate
        functional genomics. In conclusion, the two-stage PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> strategy detailed here is demonstrated to be
        highly useful and undoubtedly can be applied to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX>.
