        The precursor of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">proHB</NUMEX>-EGF) is found on a wide variety of cell surfaces and
        is present in numerous tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Previously in
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, we cloned the cDNA encoding proHB-EGF from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkey Vero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and identified this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface molecule
        as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> (DT) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
        predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> was shown to be identical to
        that of the cell surface-expressed precursor of human
        heparin-binding EGF-like growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (proHB-EGF) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ]
        . The derived amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence revealed a signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-23</ENAMEX>), an extracellular domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-159</NUMEX>), a transmembrane domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 160-184</ENAMEX>), and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxyl</ENAMEX> terminal cytoplasmic domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 185-208</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        ] . Proteolytic processing of the proHB-EGF occurs on the
        cell surface and results in the release of mature HB-EGF
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mHB</NUMEX>-EGF) (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63-148</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The mature/soluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of growth factors that
        includes amphiregulin, epidermal growth factor, and
        transforming growth factor a [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mature HB-EGF</ENAMEX> released
        from the cell surface is mitogenic and is able to bind to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF</ENAMEX> receptor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Membrane-bound proHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> has
        juxtacrine growth factor activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and also acts as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DT</ENAMEX> receptor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Previously we have described the interaction of the
        extracellular domain of proHB-EGF with the second
        extracellular domain of the tetraspanin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> CD9
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Tissue culture experiments using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX>-sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transfected</ENAMEX> mouse fibroblast cell lines expressing on the
        cell surface both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> DT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse-monkey</ENAMEX> CD9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> showed that the second
        extracellular domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> CD9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> is able to act
        as a coreceptor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> and is also responsible for the
        increased DT-sensitivity and affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> in these cell
        lines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . These observations suggested that the CD9
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> and proHB-EGF likely interact physically on the
        cell surface. Using a yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system, we have
        shown that the extracellular domain of proHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> extracellular domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> CD9 do indeed
        interact [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system strategy has been used to
        examine both intracellular and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-ligand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. The interaction of mammalian
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, prolactin, and vascular endothelial growth
        factor with their respective extracellular ligand-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been observed using yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sytems</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        The involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> in various cellular and tissue
        functions and its presence in extracellular matrices
        suggested the possibility that it may interact with other
        extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix proteins</ENAMEX>. To test this possiblity we
        used the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF in a yeast
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system to screen a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> kidney cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
        In the present report, we have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel
        extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix proteins</ENAMEX> latent transforming growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor β-binding protein 3</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fibulin-1C</TIMEX> that interact
        with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> cDNA
          library using the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF as
          the bait fusion
          The initial screening of ≈ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 × 10 6clones</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkey</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with the bait fusion of GAL4 binding
          domain fused to the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF
          yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">294</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that were able to grow on Trp -His
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Leu</ENAMEX> -media and that gave positive β-galactosidase
          activity in the β-galactosidase filter paper assay. False
          positives were ruled out by testing the β-galactosidase
          activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> clone alone or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> clone
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL4 DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain plasmid vector together
          in the yeast host strain. False positives were also ruled
          out by testing the β-galactosidase activity of the
          library clone with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pVA3</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pGBT9</TIMEX> with a cloned insert). The
          elimination of these false positive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from the
          initial screening of the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> resulted in a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> clones encoded potentially
          true interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the extracellular domain
          of proHB-EGF. Some of these cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> clones were
          transformed into the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> host strain, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y187</TIMEX>, and
          tested for β-galactosidase activity as a further check
          that these clones did indeed contain potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> for the extracellular domain
          of proHB-EGF.
        
        
          Detection of the physical interactions of proHB-EGF
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD9</ENAMEX> antigens
          The membrane-bound precursor and soluble forms of
          heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth
          factor (HB-EGF) contribute to a variety of cellular
          developmental processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The observations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> in cell and tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> have suggested roles for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> in numerous cellular and tissue events such as:
          cell movement, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> formation, tumor
          formation and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adherence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . As described above,
          the membrane-bound precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> (proHB-EGF) is
          also the cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> (DT)
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DT-sensitive cells</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          Previously we have examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions of proHB-EGF with the cell-surface CD9
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD9 antigen</ENAMEX> is found on a wide
          variety of tissue and cell types and has been reported to
          be involved in such cellular processes as B-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell metastasis</ENAMEX>, platelet activation and
          adhesion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> motility [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . CD9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the tetraspanin superfamily and consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          extracellular domains sandwiched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four</NUMEX>
          highly-conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> extracellular domain (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-130 amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX>) is larger than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> extracellular domain
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-27</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>). Short cytoplasmic domains (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-14</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) are found at both the amino and carboxyl
          termini of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . As reported previously, we used a
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> and observed interaction between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> extracellular domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MkCD9</ENAMEX> and the
          extracellular domain of proHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . However,
          despite repeated attempts, using the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, we were unable to show interaction between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amino</ENAMEX> terminal cytoplasmic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> CD9 and the
          cytoplasmic domain of proHB-EGF; these results may
          reflect the limitation of the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system as
          the insert sizes cloned into the vectors may be too small
          resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gal4</TIMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose "test subunits"
          are masked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Gal4</TIMEX> subunit. This would result in the
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being unable to recognize each other.
          The results of screening the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey cv</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cDNA library
          with the bait plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGBT9/DTREx</ENAMEX> were somewhat
          surprising in that no portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD9 protein</ENAMEX> were
          represented among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF. These results may
          reflect improper folding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD9 protein</ENAMEX> fragments encoded
          by cDNA inserts or these results may be due to under
          representation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD9</NUMEX> cDNA in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey cv</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>. It was also surprising that the extracellular
          portion of any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF receptor proteins</ENAMEX> was also not
          represented among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF, since the mature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein proteolytically cleaved</ENAMEX> from proHB-EGF (mHB-EGF)
          as well as the membrane bound form are known to interact
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF</ENAMEX> receptor.
        
        
          The extracellular domain of proHB-EGF interacts
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> LTBP-3
          The positive interaction of the fragment of the latent
          transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor β-binding protein-3</ENAMEX> (LTBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF was of great
          interest (Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Recently it has been
          reported that treatment of EGF-responsive, nontransformed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat intestinal</ENAMEX> crypt cell line RIE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
          resulted in an increased level of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is ubiquitous in tissues
          and cells. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> contain
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1242 and 1251</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, respectively, and each protein
          has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>. Each has a signal sequence
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>, respectively), a second domain
          containing an EGF-like repeat, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proline</ENAMEX>/glycine rich
          region, a fibrillin motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , an EGF calcium-binding
          repeat, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β repeat (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">390 and 389</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
          respectively), a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> domain containing a
          proline/glycine rich <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113 and 111</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
          respectively), a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> domain containing numerous
          calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> EGF-like modules
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I/V</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E/D</ENAMEX>)C

          sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence obtained
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> LTBP-3 sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number
          AF395658) shows it to share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.6 %</NUMEX> identity with the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">032546</ENAMEX>).
          The presence of the calcium-binding EGF-like modules
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> LTBP-3 is noteworthy. It is well established
          that EGF-like modules are important structural features
          found in many extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and that these
          modules enable numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> :<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX>;
          the binding of EGF-like modules in laminin to nidogen [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] and the interaction of EGF-like modules within
          fibrillin monomers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium</ENAMEX> may be required
          for some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX>.
          At the time of writing, there have not been any
          reported interactions of these EGF-like modules in LTBP-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It is interesting that
          the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> hybridization and yeast
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screens used in this study to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact with the extracellular domain of
          proHB-EGF yielded independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL4-LTBP-3</ENAMEX> fusion proteins
          that all contained these calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> EGF-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A constructed clone, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pGAD424/LTBP-3</ENAMEX>
          EGF<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1-8</NUMEX>, that contained calcium-binding type EGF-like
          modules <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1-8 fused</NUMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX>-activation domain (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> and methods) was tested using the
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> and found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF (Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          These negatively-charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>-like modules of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> may
          interact efficiently with the positively-charged
          heparin-binding domain of both the membrane-bound and
          soluble forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX>. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of the
          heparin-binding region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> (
          21KRKKKGKGLGKKRDPCLRKYK <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] has been shown to have
          a strong affinity for heparin and may influence the
          interaction of this growth factor with cell-surface
          negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heparan sulfate proteoglycans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          It remains to be seen whether specific/all of the
          EGF-like modules are required and whether calcium is
          needed for the interaction of HB-EGF with LTBP-3.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3 protein</ENAMEX> is secreted as a soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
          from the cell surface into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>. Two
          of the proposed functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP proteins</ENAMEX> include
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protecting TGF</ENAMEX>-β from premature proteolytic cleavage and
          targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β to its appropriate cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
          During cellular synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β, a small latent
          complex containing the latency-associated peptide and the
          mature TGF-β is synthesized. This small latent complex
          may be secreted inefficiently from the cell surface at
          relatively slow rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . However, when the small
          latent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is bound by the latent transforming growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor β-binding protein</ENAMEX> via a disulfide bond to the
          latency-associated peptide, the result is the formation
          of a large latent complex which may be secreted
          efficiently and at a relatively high rate compared to the
          small latent complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latent TGF</ENAMEX>-β is then
          released from the extracellular matrix via proteolytic
          cleavage from the large latent complex, and the resulting
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β is now able to bind to the appropriate TGF-β
          cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          It is well accepted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β is important for the
          regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix synthesis</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β increases the
          expression of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix proteins</ENAMEX> as
          fibronectin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibronectin</ENAMEX> receptor, vitronectin,
          tenascin, elastin, thrombospondin, collagen, and biglycan
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] and also inhibits expression
          of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix while
          stimulating the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] .
          It is interesting to note that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulus</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnard</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">R1E</NUMEX> cells
          resulted in increased level of HB-EGF expression, they
          did not report any direct physical interactions between
          the growth factors TGF-β and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX>. It may be that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> provides a physical link between soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mHB</ENAMEX>-EGF
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-β.</ENAMEX> Possible functions for the apparent
          interaction of mHB-EGF with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> include the targeting
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β within its protective large latent complex
          to its appropriate TGF-β <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, or the
          targeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β large latent complex to the EGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> via binding of mHB-EGF to the appropriate EGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. These are reasonable functions for the role of
          the proposed mHB-EGF :<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3 protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interactions
          as the expression of both mHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β is important
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> formation in wound healing [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 25</NUMEX> ] ; it has been suggested that the coordinated
          activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-β</ENAMEX> regulate the wound healing
          process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .

          extracellular matrix. As explained above, mHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> has
          been reported to be involved as a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          such tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developmental</ENAMEX> processes as wound healing and
          it is feasible that the direct physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          mHB-EGF with fibulin-1 may be useful in the tissue
          remodeling of a wound site and in scar formation.
          The results presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> now suggest that
          there is potential in carrying out experiments to further
          delineate the molecular interactions between proHB-EGF
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> and between proHB-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and fibulin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>. A
          transitional step in this process will be the expression
          and purification of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In order to rule out
          false positives that may have resulted from the yeast
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system, experiments that provide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation data or solid phase binding
          results of the interaction of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will be
          useful.
          The interaction of EGF-modules with either non
          EGF-like modules (e.g. the EGF-like modules of fibulin-1C
          interacting with the heparin-binding region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin</ENAMEX>) or with EGF-like modules (e.g. the
          interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fibulin-1C</TIMEX> with aggrecan and versican)
          between extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix proteins</ENAMEX> argues for the
          interaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF-modules</ENAMEX> containing within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fibulin-1C</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> with either the heparin-binding
          region or with the EGF-like domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we have shown the interaction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF using a
        yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system. The interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fibulin-1C</ENAMEX> with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF may
        provide further insights into the roles that these proteins
        play in cellular and tissue development processes. The
        trafficking of such growth factors as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB-EGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β and
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within the extracellular matrix is
        important in wound healing processes. Therefore, the
        interactions of HB-EGF with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTBP-3</ENAMEX> and fibulin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX> described
        in this study suggest novel functions for HB-EGF between
        cell-surfaces and tissue surfaces.

        produce construct <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pGBT9/prodelHB-EGF</ENAMEX>.
        All plasmid constructs were transformed into the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y187 and Y190</TIMEX>,
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lithium</ENAMEX> acetate protocol as per the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Y190 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transformants</ENAMEX> containing

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trp -Leu</ENAMEX> -His -agar plates. The triple auxotrophic
        transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity
        using the filter paper assay described in the manual
        provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>. A positive control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y187</ENAMEX> or Y190
        containing both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmids pTD1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pVA3</ENAMEX> together was
        included in every β-galactosidase assay. A negative control
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y187</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y190</ENAMEX> containing both plasmid vectors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGBT9</ENAMEX> and
        pGAD424, was included in all β-galactosidase assays.
        Each construct from the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> that tested
