        Sucrase-isomaltase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2.1.48</NUMEX>) is an
        enterocyte-specific small intestine brush-border membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disaccharidase</ENAMEX>. It is required for hydrolysis of dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sucrose</ENAMEX> and some starches. Because absorption cannot take
        place until monosaccharides are produced, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI deficiency</ENAMEX>
        leads to increased luminal disaccharides and consequent
        osmotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. Although generally thought to have a
        later presentation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] than other primary intestinal
        malabsorption syndromes, recent reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX>
        deficiency indicate the existence of an early onset form
        (presentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-16 weeks</TIMEX>) that is
        complicated by severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starnes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] observed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal calculi</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sucrase deficiency</ENAMEX>, but neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercalcemia</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypercalcemia</ENAMEX> frequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">complicates congenital lactase deficiency</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The
        present case illustrates the occurrence of hypercalcemia
        and nephrocalcinosis as a clinically significant
        complication of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI deficiency</ENAMEX> in an infant and suggests
        that common mechanisms may lead to hypercalcemia in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX>
        and congenital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lactase deficiency</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Case Presentation
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 month</TIMEX> old caucasian female infant
        presenting with failure to thrive (FTT), metabolic
        acidosis, and hypercalcemia. She was the product of a term
        uncomplicated pregnancy in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-year-old</TIMEX> and delivered
        without complications. She had been growing well and
        thriving until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weaned</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> to formula at age 4
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> when she began to have frequent stools and poor
        weight gain. Formula and diet changes were attempted
        without improvement. She was seen by a pediatric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastroenterologist</ENAMEX> and underwent colonoscopy, a biopsy from
        which showed eosinophilic inflammation. Upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> tract
        endoscopy was interrupted because of sedation problems. She
        was treated with glucocorticoids and her formula was
        changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neocate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> mg Ca<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/100</NUMEX> mL) with some initial
        improvement. The glucocorticoids were discontinued at age 9
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> but she still gained weight poorly; routine
        chemistry analyses showed evolving hypercalcemia
        (outpatient calcium peak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
        persistent metabolic acidosis. She was admitted to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> for evaluation and treatment of hypercalcemia,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTT</ENAMEX>, and metabolic acidosis.
        Other than skin changes consistent with wasting, her
        examination was benign. There was no abnormal flatus or
        bloating, but there had been intermittent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the
        stool with some mucous. Laboratory studies are shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The intact parathyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (PTH) was
        appropriately suppressed to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 pg/mL</ENAMEX> with concomitant serum
        calcium of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL and ionized calcium (Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.98</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmol/L</ENAMEX> (normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.38</NUMEX>); other pertinent laboratory
        values included: phosphorus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL; magnesium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL;
        alkaline phosphatase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IU/L</ENAMEX>; PTH-related peptide (PTH-rp)
        appropriately undetectable at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.2 pmol</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> (normal <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8</NUMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-hydroxy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitamin D</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL (reference lab normal
        range for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3-17 years</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-67</NUMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxy
        Vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> pg/mL (reference lab normal range for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3-17 years</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27-71</NUMEX>). The urine calcium was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL
        with urine <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">creatinine < 10 mg/dL.</ENAMEX> Renal ultrasound
        demonstrated nephrocalcinosis. The hemi-skeletal bone age
        was interpreted to be delayed to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-6 month old</TIMEX>.
        Stools were positive for leukocytes and trace reducing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. Normal karyotype and normal fluorescent in-situ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) for the elastin gene locus on
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7q11.23</ENAMEX>) along with a
        negative echocardiogram helped exclude <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> syndrome.
        She initially was treated with intravenous normal saline
        followed by furosemide with only transient improvement.
        Recurrent hypercalcemia prompted a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-day</TIMEX> course of
        intravenous pamidronate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per dose) leading to
        sustained high-normal serum calcium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). She was
        discharged home. She was empirically treated with
        Polycitraâ„¢ for the persistent metabolic acidosis, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">on-going FTT</ENAMEX> prompted reevaluation.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> admission the infant was taking
        Neocate supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> jars of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> per
        day plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polycitraâ„¢.</ENAMEX> Gross motor development was delayed
        but other developmental axes were intact. Family history
        was significant for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hashimoto</ENAMEX>'s thyroiditis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>,
        maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, and maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were
        both of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ethnic origin and there was no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consanguinity</ENAMEX>. Physical examination showed an alert,
        nondysmorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> with severe reduction in muscle mass
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous fat</ENAMEX>. Frequent loose watery stools were
        noted. A skeletal survey showed striking linear bone
        density increase in the epiphyses in an area adjacent to
        the growth plate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Follow up admission
        laboratory studies are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Specifically, the
        calcitonin was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> pg/mL (normal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 12</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin A</ENAMEX>
        concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 Î</NUMEX>¼g/dL (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-43</NUMEX>). The urine calcium was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL and calcium/creatinine ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EKG</ENAMEX> showed
        a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal QTc</TIMEX>. Renal ultrasound confirmed nephrocalcinosis
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). Upper endoscopy with biopsy revealed areas of
        mild focal chronic inflammatory cells in the stomach.
        Colonoscopy showed no bowel wall inflammation but copious
        watery stool. Stool sodium was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>
        The persistence of hypercalcemia with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> prompted
        a nuclear medicine scan with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 mCi</NUMEX> of 111indium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentetreotide</ENAMEX> to pursue a possible paraneoplastic process [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] which showed uptake in the right orbital region. A head
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and MRI demonstrated an infiltrating lesion in the right
        orbit along the inferior and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral compartment</ENAMEX> of the
        orbit involving the intra- and extra-coronal space. There
        was no obvious lytic change or periostosis; however, there
        were flow voids consistent with a vascular malformation. No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in extraocular movements, globe, or retina
        were observed. These findings were interpreted as
        consistent with a benign orbital hemangioma. Serial follow
        up studies confirm that the lesion is not growing; indeed
        there is evidence of fatty involution.

        sucrase-isomaltase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. Sucrose free diet with
        Sucraidâ„¢ enzyme replacement was prescribed followed by
        changing feeds to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3232A</NUMEX> base formula with supplemental
        anhydrous dextrose (Ca <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">94 mg/100 mL</NUMEX>) resulting in a prompt
        cessation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. Urine calcium/creatinine ratio
        decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>. Her weight has steadily improved (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Residual</ENAMEX> muscle weakness in the lower extremities is

        Causes of hypercalcemia in infancy
        An extensive evaluation of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> failed to
        identify any abnormality in calcium regulation. It should
        be emphasized that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> demonstrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrocalcinosis</ENAMEX> prior to alkalinization with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polycitraâ„</ENAMEX>¢ to
        combat her metabolic acidosis. Urine alkalinization is a
        common strategy to treat urate and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cysteine renal stones</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animal</ENAMEX> and preliminary human studies suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-phosphate
        replacement (vs. neutral-phosphate therapy) is of equal
        benefit and does not perturb calcium/phosphorus metabolism
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate-wasting rickets</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Infants</ENAMEX>
        with hypercalcemia may have no obvious symptoms, but
        constitutional symptoms such as poor appetite,
        irritability, vomiting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTT</ENAMEX>, or occasionally seizures may
        occur [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Classically, hypercalcemia leads to increased
        urine output and diminished stool frequency. Physical signs
        may include hypotonia, dehydration, and bradycardia.
        Laboratory abnormalities can include short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTc</ENAMEX> and elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creatinine</ENAMEX>. Increased urinary calcium is an expected
        compensatory response with associated increased risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal calculi</ENAMEX>. The differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> includes hyperparathyroidism, familial
        hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis,
        paraneoplastic processes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> syndrome.
        Hyperparathyroidism may be either sporadic or familial
        arising from either adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia.
        Familial hyperparathyroidism may be confined to parathyroid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenoma</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HRPT1 #145000</NUMEX>) or may involve the broader
        endocrine disturbances of multiple endocrine neoplasia
        Types I (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#131100</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#171400</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MENI</ENAMEX> results from
        mutations in menin, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFÎ²</ENAMEX> signaling in a
        variety of tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MENIIA</ENAMEX> results form mutations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RET</ENAMEX> a cell surface growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> with intrinsic
        tyrosine kinase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Familial hypocalciuric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercalcemia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#145980</NUMEX>), generally autosomal dominant and
        caused by mutations in the renal calcium sensing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , is excluded rather easily based on urinary
        calcium levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
        Both hypervitaminoses <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and A are potential causes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercalcemia</ENAMEX>. Prolonged feeding with over fortified milk
        or vitamin preparations has been reported as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        excess intake of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Abnormal</ENAMEX> vitamin D metabolism
        resulting from inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> or as seen in neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat necrosis</ENAMEX> are
        additional potential causes, albeit highly unlikely in
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The mechanism is thought to be due
        to increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1Ã¡</NUMEX>-hydroxylase activity leading to increased
        production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxy Vitamin D.
        While neoplasia with osseous metastasis is a potential
        cause of hypercalcemia, tumors may also secrete materials
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTH-rp</ENAMEX> or other osteoclast-activating factors,
        cytokines, or other growth factors that modulate bone
        remodeling leading to calcium adsorption from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immobilization</ENAMEX> can also lead to enhanced bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorption</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> syndrome is a well described birth defect
        complex characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTT</ENAMEX>, branch pulmonary artery
        stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, dysmorphic facies,
        mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX>, and infantile hypercalcemia. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX>
        syndrome results from a constitutional deletion in
        chromosome 7q11.23 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The cause of hypercalcemia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> syndrome is not well understood
        but has been postulated to be associated with enhanced
        intestinal absorption of calcium. The presence or absence
        of significant hypercalcemia does not correlate with the
        deletion size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency
        Sucrase-isomaltase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> is a rare autosomal
        recessive disorder in which there is complete absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sucrase</ENAMEX> and most of the maltase digestive activity. The
        usual presentation generally is at weaning from breast milk
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are first exposed to the offending
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbohydrates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Upon ingestion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disaccharides</ENAMEX> and oligosaccharides, the failure to
        breakdown sucrose into fructose and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> results in an
        osmotic-fermentative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. Occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may come
        to attention in late childhood or adulthood but careful
        history often indicates that symptoms have appeared earlier
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . The mainstay of treatment is dietary
        restriction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sucrose-containing foods</ENAMEX>. Effective enzyme
        replacement with whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> has been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast enzyme</ENAMEX>, sacrosidase, is a highly effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjunct</ENAMEX> to dietary restriction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The enzyme itself is composed of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1827</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        encoded by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3364</TIMEX> bp mRNA. The gene locus has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> exons
        spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">106.6 kB</NUMEX>. Pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SI</ENAMEX> is anchored in the membrane by a
        20 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid membrane</ENAMEX>-spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. This is followed
        by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid stalk</ENAMEX> on which sit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> globular
        catalytic domains. The catalytic domains are similar to one
        another (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity) indicating that they have
        arisen by duplication and divergence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> estimate
        indicated a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> mutant heterozygote frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] but, given the rarity of diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, this seems high. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sucrase deficiency</ENAMEX> may be
        especially common in indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Greenlanders</ENAMEX> (estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>)
        and is accompanied most often by lactase deficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX>
        ] . Initial studies demonstrated that most SI mutations
        result in lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme protein</ENAMEX> (i.e. null mutation) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutation</ENAMEX> may alter the post-translational processing of
        the enzyme only for the asparagines-linked high-mannose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> but not the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">oligosaccharides</TIMEX>. The resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is both mislocalized and unstable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Q1098P</TIMEX>, was found to cause retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX> in the
        transport pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum and
        Golgi apparatus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . An unusual mutation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Q117R</TIMEX>, that
        alters the structure close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-glycosylated stalk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, leads to random distribution of the enzyme to both
        the apical and basolateral cell membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . An
        unusual human mutation that causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI</ENAMEX> to be secreted rather
        than retained in the plasma membrane demonstrates that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is required to be at the enterocyte cell surface [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disaccharidase deficiency</ENAMEX> and hypercalcemia
        A single case report potentially relates <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI deficiency</ENAMEX>
        with disturbance of calcium metabolism. In that study, two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> presented with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal calculi</ENAMEX> and nephrocalcinosis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lactase deficiency</ENAMEX> may give rise to metabolic bone
        disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . More pertinently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saarela et al</ENAMEX> described
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congenital lactase deficiency</ENAMEX> who had
        hypercalcemia at the time of initial presentation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> had medullary nephrocalcinosis. The
        mechanism by which congenital lactase deficiency induces
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercalcemia</ENAMEX> is uncertain. There may be roles for chronic
        metabolic acidosis and dehydration in promoting both
        increased bone mobilization of calcium and thus increasing
        the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal deposition</ENAMEX>. Non-hydrolyzed lactose may
        also exert a direct enhancing effect on calcium absorption
        in the ileum. In other conditions with chronic diarrhea,
        such as inflammatory bowel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal stones</ENAMEX> have been
        composed of calcium phosphate or oxalate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Alternatively, it is possible that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX> and lactase are
        connected mechanistically to intestinal calcium homeostasis
        through molecular interactions with calcium transporters.
        In this regard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SI</ENAMEX>, lactase, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OH-VitD3</ENAMEX> (VDR) share transcriptional regulation through the
        homeodomain transcription factor CDX2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . The
        possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lactase deficiency</ENAMEX> could cause
        secondary up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> awaits exploration in cell
        culture or animal models.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SI deficiency</ENAMEX> should be added to the
        list of disorders that can cause infantile hypercalcemia
        and particularly may be considered when accompanied by FTT
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">watery diarrhea</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> should have careful monitoring of serum calcium.
        Prolonged periods of diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noncompliance</ENAMEX> may increase the
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic renal disease</ENAMEX> secondary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrocalcinosis</ENAMEX>. Infants presenting with persistent,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">watery diarrhea</ENAMEX> should be evaluated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX>.
