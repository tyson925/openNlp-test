        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 1.2 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are at risk of developing
        lymphatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 128 million</NUMEX> are estimated to
        have circulating microfilariae or one of the various
        clinical conditions associated with filarial infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . With tools currently available, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphatic filariasis</ENAMEX>,
        in principle, could be eliminated. Combined drug treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> using annual treatment with microfilaricidal drugs
        are the method of choice for combating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filarial</ENAMEX> infection
        and elimination programs using this strategy have commenced
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Demonstrating the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> programs depends
        on careful monitoring of infection levels in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> as well as vectors following the introduction
        of the drug intervention. Due to reluctance on the part of
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> to submit to regular blood examinations,
        assessment of infection in vectors offers advantages for
        the monitoring of infection after a mass treatment program
        has been implemented. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> methods of detecting infection in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that are now being widely used are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> has been the gold standard
        for measuring infection level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>; however,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> becomes increasingly costly and laborious in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> where mosquito infection prevalence drops <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 1%</NUMEX>.
        Furthermore, in preliminary studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was more sensitive
        for detecting filarial parasites in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> than
        conventional dissection and microscopy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The ability
        to adapt PCR techniques to detect microfilariae in pools of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> suggests that current PCR methods should be
        adequate for testing large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in the
        context of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> elimination programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> has already
        been demonstrated to be a successful tool for monitoring
        onchocerciasis programs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . The availability of such
        a tool permits rigorous surveillance for resumption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> following completion of control
        activities.
        This study was designed to monitor mosquito infection
        levels in conjunction with a mass treatment program for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> in the commune of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leogane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>. The goal of
        this program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leogane</ENAMEX> was to develop an effective
        elimination strategy that could be adapted to other
        settings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> and elsewhere. The drug intervention
        consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> treatment with diethylcarbamazine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEC</ENAMEX>)
        and albendazole and was monitored by collecting data in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        well-characterized sentinel sites. We assessed filarial
        infection rates of vectors trapped in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> sentinel sites
        and compared PCR with dissection as monitoring tools.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study site
          The study was conducted in the plains of the Commune
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leogane</ENAMEX>, located west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port au Prince</ENAMEX>. To monitor
          the impact of the mass treatment program, sentinel sites
          were chosen based on estimated community antigen
          prevalence inferred from rapid card-based
          immunochromatographic testing (ICT) of local school
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amrad ICT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New South Wales</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>).
          Microfilaria prevalence and intensity were assessed in
          the sentinel sites prior to the intervention. Mass
          treatment using single dose diethylcarbamazine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 mg/kg</ENAMEX>)
          and albendazole (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">400 mg</NUMEX>) was carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>. Details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> distribution will be
          reported elsewhere. Research activities in the sentinel
          sites were reviewed and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dame Institutional Review Boards</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hopital St. Croix</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosquito Trapping</ENAMEX>
          The main vector for 
          Wuchereria bancrofiti in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> is 
          Culex quinquefasciatus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Some
          transmission occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX>. The trapping of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> was done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> gravid traps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 1712</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.W. Hock Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gainesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 6</NUMEX> per sentinel
          site. Collections were done in each sentinel site for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive nights every other week</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were
          collected from traps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of
          dawn. After transport to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopital St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were knocked down by placing trap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-20Â°C</NUMEX> freezer for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> or by
          introduction of a triethylamine-soaked <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton pad</ENAMEX>, and
          subsequently separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and sex; undesired
          specimens were noted and discarded (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and non-vector
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>). Female 
          Culex <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were divided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          for assay by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> or dissection for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> caught at each trap; the remainder was used
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to be used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desiccated</ENAMEX> and sorted until shipment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> for
          processing. Because preliminary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> experiments showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> to be an occasional problem when pool sizes of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> or greater were used, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> to be desiccated were
          sorted into batches of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and
          then placed atop a cotton plug, which was above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/4 inch</NUMEX>
          of drierite desiccant in a polypropylene screw cap tube.
          This ensured desiccation and reduced any concerns about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungal</ENAMEX> contamination during storage and transport.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosquito Dissection</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were dissected on a glass slide using a set
          of dissection needles to separate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, thorax, and
          abdomen. A saline solution was dropped onto each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> segments were then teased apart and
          examined stereoscopically to reveal larval stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Mosquito</ENAMEX> infection status was noted as well
          as the corresponding location of the parasites. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dissected mosquitoes</ENAMEX> harboring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rdstage
          larvae were microscopically examined at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100Ã</NUMEX> to verify
          filarial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. A maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were
          dissected per trap per day. Dissection results were
          entered into an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Epi</ENAMEX>-Info database. Infective <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
          were defined as those containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L3 larvae</ENAMEX> in any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body segments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mosquitoes carrying microfilaria</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX>,
          or L3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX> were defined as infected.
        
        
          Extraction of DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification was performed as
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanteau et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, the dried
          pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were homogenized with a pellet pestle
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimble/Kontes, Vineland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î¼l</NUMEX> of NIB

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The beads were washed to remove
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. After washing, the silica beads were dried
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was then eluted into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l of 1X Tris-EDTA
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.02%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>), pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> Amplification
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for the competitive ELISA analysis was

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Devices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr
          development with substrate. A positive sample was defined
          as previously described, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> times the uncorrected
          optical density (OD) of a sample containing no template
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, but with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> fg of internal control [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The
          controls were designed to allow for cutoff determination,
          as well as to determine the success of the PCR

        Results
        Baseline microfilaria prevalence in the human population
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.9%</NUMEX> in the sentinel sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Median microfilaria level ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 11</NUMEX> microfilaria
        per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼l for microfilaria-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. Microfilaria
        intensity did not differ significantly by sentinel site
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Mass treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEC/albendazole</ENAMEX> took place
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of October 2000</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> were taken by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of
        the at risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 months</TIMEX> following
        treatment, microfilaria prevalence declined to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3%</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4% and 6%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barrier Jeudi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathieu, Mapou</ENAMEX> and
        Leogane, respectively.
        To monitor the impact of mass treatment on filarial
        infection level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, trapping was initiated in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August of 2000, 3 months</TIMEX> prior to mass treatment. Because
        the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> trapped and percentage of infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes varied</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month to month</TIMEX>, results were pooled
        into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> intervals for analysis. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mosquito</ENAMEX> infection levels, as detected by dissection,
        declined from pre-treatment to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> post-treatment
        interval in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>; however, these decreases were
        statistically significant in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, Leogane
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barrier Jeudi</ENAMEX>. With the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapou</ENAMEX>, larval
        infection rates were lower in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> than in the first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> time interval following treatment. The numbers of
        L3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX> recovered declined significantly in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> sentinel sites (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). If we adopt a
        more conservative definition of what constitutes an
        infective mosquito and restrict our analysis to those with
        L3 found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, no change over time was observed. In
        fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9459</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes dissected</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L3</TIMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> bancrofti infection of 
        Culex <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> was also assessed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX> pools (median pool size = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
        collected over the study period. Because pool sizes ranged
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1 to 15</TIMEX>, we used Poolscreen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> to generate point
        estimates and confidence intervals for the level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filarial</ENAMEX> infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, point
        estimates of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> bancrofti infection prevalence
        declined following mass treatment in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-sentinel sites.
        Because of the relatively wide confidence intervals,
        significant declines in infection prevalence were observed
        in only <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barrier Jeudi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leogane</ENAMEX> for both time periods
        following treatment, mirroring the results obtained with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX>.
        We also compared changes in infection prevalence for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosquito</ENAMEX> pools of constant size (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) collected in the
        Leogane sentinel site. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sentinel sites did
        not have enough pools of this size to conduct this analysis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Infection prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leogane</ENAMEX> decreased from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5%</NUMEX> pre-treatment to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.55%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three months</TIMEX>
        following treatment and to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12%</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time period
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> agree closely with those
        generated when all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> were included in the analysis.
        There was a moderately strong correlation between larval
        infection rates as determined by dissection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Careful monitoring of filarial transmission is
        necessary, both to make programmatic decisions about
        stopping mass treatment as well as to assist with
        certification of elimination. Serologic tools for
        assessment of exposure to the parasite are still under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and testing. Assessing infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> can
        be considered a "lagging indicator" because the prepatent
        period may extend for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after infection. In contrast,
        entomologic measures of filarial infection of vectors
        provide "real-time" estimates of filarial transmission. We
        compared dissection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to determine their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> as
        monitoring tools for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> elimination programs.
        For monitoring mosquito infection status within the
        context of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis elimination</ENAMEX> program, mosquito
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> has been the gold standard against which other
        methods are compared. Our dissection results show a marked
        decrease in infection level from the pre-treatment period
        to the end of the post-treatment study period in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        sites that we monitored (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The exception was
        Mapou, which started and ended the study with almost the
        same infection prevalence in the mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> we
        collected. This can be attributed to the smaller than
        desired sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> captured (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">379</NUMEX> pre-treatment
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">370</NUMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> post-treatment time interval) and
        the low infection prevalence that we observed there.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays of captured mosquitoes
        generated similar, but not identical results. We observed a
        positive correlation between larval infection rates
        determined by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The proportion
        of positive pools detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was, as expected, higher
        than that obtained by dissection, even after using the
        PoolScreen program to calculate a point estimate of
        infection prevalence. This can be accounted for by the
        increased sensitivity that is provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay,
        especially for detection of early larval stages that are
        more difficult to detect by dissection. Independent of the
        method used, mass treatment led to a reduction in levels of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. bancrofti in</ENAMEX> trapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> as
        assessed by dissection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. The reductions evident via
        dissection were observed in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> sentinel sites studied,
        representing an overall decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.8%</NUMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-treatment</ENAMEX> levels to the final study interval 6 months
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-treatment</ENAMEX>. The decreases in filaria-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> were comparable to the decreases in microfilaria
        prevalence seen in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the sentinel
        sites.
        Although dissection is a very effective way to monitor
        infection prevalence in vector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, it is a very
        laborious method for monitoring infection prevalence that
        requires highly trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> and can be cost
        intensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> is most suitable for monitoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mosquito</ENAMEX> infection levels when the infection level in the
        mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. This will be true
        in early stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> programs. The decision to use
        dissection rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> may also be influenced by the
        trapping method. Household collections may yield
        substantially higher rates of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> than the
        gravid traps that were employed in our study. When
        infection prevalence declines below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, the potential for
        missing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> infected with the earliest larval stages
        and for misidentifying the species of filarial larvae found
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> increases. Another concern pointed out by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burkot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ichimori</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] is that, as infection level
        declines, increasing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> must be
        dissected in order to demonstrate a significant decline in
        infection prevalence. This is especially true for infective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX>. In our study, the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> carrying
        infective larvae, as detected by dissection, were
        insufficient to allow for an adequate statistical analysis
        of changes in infection prevalence. Monitoring transmission
        levels based on levels of infective larvae may not be
        feasible within the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphatic filariasis</ENAMEX>
        elimination programs in settings like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leogane</ENAMEX> where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culex</ENAMEX> is the vector because of the
        relative rarity of identifying infective <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. Lot
        quality assurance methods may provide an alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> strategy that may prove useful for demonstrating
        with the smallest possible number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filarial</ENAMEX> infection is below a pre-established threshold [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> permit larger number of samples
        to be evaluated for infection prevalence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is both
        specific and highly sensitive for the detection of parasite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The primary limitations are the cost and the need for
        a well-equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> methods are also
        limited by a lack of robust statistical methods to compare
        and analyze data obtained from unequal pool sizes. Although
        confidence intervals of infection before and after
        treatment were overlapping for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the sentinel sites, it
        is important to point out that confidence intervals were
        not overlapping for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations where dissection data
        indicated significant declines in larval prevalence.
        We used a competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> system in order to control for
        the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that could prevent amplification
        and detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parasite DNA</ENAMEX>. The disadvantage of the
        competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is the need to use an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA assay</ENAMEX> to
        quantify the product and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, adding to the cost
        of the assay. Work underway is focused on trying to develop
        a standardized PCR methodology for all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX> programs
        to employ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Simple standardized methods would permit
        comparisons of infection levels across epidemiologic
        settings as has been done with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> volvulus in black flies for
        Onchocerciasis control programs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . PCR methods for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">onchocerciasis</ENAMEX> work reliably for pools of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 100</NUMEX> fly
        heads, an important advantage in terms of cost and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">throughput</ENAMEX>. As similar methods are validated for lymphatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filariasis</ENAMEX>, it is important to bear in mind that assay
        sensitivity will decline as filarial infection prevalence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreases</ENAMEX>, independent of the method used to detect 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">W. bancrofti .</ENAMEX> Consequently, quality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> considerations will become more important as the
        program progresses. WHO should consider distribution of
        controls to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> involved in PCR testing to permit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-laboratory comparisons of results. Periodic
        proficiency testing represents an additional
        possibility.
        A main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of mass treatment programs is whether or
        not the decreases in transmission will be sustainable over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and will eliminate completely transmission of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. Although infection levels were
        decreased, transmission of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. bancrofti</ENAMEX> was not interrupted by a
        single cycle of mass treatment in our study. This is not
        surprising given the intensity of transmission in this
        setting and the modest coverage in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round.
        Additional follow up will be necessary to determine how
        many cycles of mass treatment will be necessary to achieve
        interruption of transmission in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leogane</ENAMEX>. These results will
        have important implications for the length of lymphatic
        filariasis elimination programs.
