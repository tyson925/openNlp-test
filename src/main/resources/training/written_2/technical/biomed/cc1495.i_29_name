        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancomycin</ENAMEX> is among the most effective antibiotics for
        treatment of methicillin-resistant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus infections</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>], and it is widely used prophylactically in cardiac
        surgery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Among the adverse effects of vancomycin
        (apart from nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity), anaphylactoid
        reactions may occur, which manifest clinically as cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX>, pruritus ('red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>' syndrome), hypotension and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">broncospasm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. These reactions are caused by
        histamine release, and are not mediated by an immunological
        mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>].
        In our cardiosurgical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> vancomycin is administered
        pro-phylactically before induction of anaesthesia in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing open-heart surgery, and in some such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we have observed the occurrence of pruritus,
        localized or generalized, during infusion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>. We therefore conducted the present study to
        investigate the haemodynamic behaviour that follows the
        occurrence of pruritus, and to compare it with that
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are free from this clinical
        sign.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and methods
        We studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing elective coronary
        artery bypass surgery, following approval from the local
        ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> and once written informed consent had been
        obtained from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Admission criteria to the study
        were as follows: stable preoperative haemodynamic
        conditions, no intravenous cardiovascular therapy, no
        preoperative diuretic therapy, sinus rhythm, no history of
        anaphylactic reactions, and normal hepatic and renal
        function.
        Preoperative therapy was continued until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Premedication</ENAMEX> consisted of morphine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>) and scopolamine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>), administered
        intramuscularly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> entered the
        operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. After the monitoring devices had been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">positioned</ENAMEX> (electrocardiograph leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DII-V5</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ST-</TIMEX>segment
        analysis; radial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery cannula</ENAMEX> and pulmonary artery
        catheter [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH 050050-H</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow International</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reading</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>] transcuta-neous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> saturation
        probe), vancomycin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) was administered at a
        constant rate by a syringe pump (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPS</ENAMEX> Fre-senius; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grenoble</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min.
        A complete haemodynamic profile was taken for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at the following time points: before the
        administration of vancomycin (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX> (time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">point 2</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX> (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) after the beginning of
        vancomycin infusion; and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> after vancomycin infusion
        had been stopped (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Apart from collection of
        haemodynamic data, at each time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX>
        were drawn (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the radial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery cannula</ENAMEX> and another
        from the distal port of the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter) in
        order to measure arterial and mixed venous blood parameters
        that are necessary for calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX> (i.e.
        haemoglobin concentration, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> tension and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX>).
        Each haemodynamic profile consisted of parameters
        measured directly (i.e. heart rate, systemic and pulmonary
        pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venous</ENAMEX> pressure and cardiac output) and those that were
        calculated (i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVRI</ENAMEX>, pulmonary vascular resistance index
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVRI</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVI</ENAMEX>).
        The pulmonary shunt fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX>) was calculated
        using the following equation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]:
        
        Where CcO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is the pulmonary capillary oxygen
        content, CaO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is the arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> content, and
        CvO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is the mixed venous oxygen
        content.
        Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> was performed by the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, using a blood gas system (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">288</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) located just outside the
        operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
        During the study all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> breathed room air, and
        crystalloid was continuously infused at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ml/kg</ENAMEX>
        per hour, which was increased if necessary to offset a
        moderate reduction in systemic arterial pressure. If mean
        blood pressure decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20%</NUMEX>, then more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>
        and/or boluses of ephedrine were infused, vancomycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infusion</ENAMEX> was temporarily discontinued and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
        excluded from the study.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who exhibited pruritus during vancomycin
        infusion; and group B, including those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not
        exhibit pruritis. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was then divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> on the basis of preoperative therapy with a
        β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1 and B1</TIMEX> were treated with a
        β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A2 and B2</TIMEX> were not.
        The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were analysed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-test and analysis of
        variance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
        statistically significant.

        provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. There were no significant differences

        Heart rate and mean systemic arterial pressure exhibited a
        slight but not significant decrease, whereas the other
        haemodynamic parameters remained stable. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points 2
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> there were no significant changes in haemodynamic

        showed a significant increase (

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group B</ENAMEX> throughout the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX>
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> saturation showed

        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> as compared with time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in patients
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A and subgroup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3and 4</ENAMEX>).
        In the majority of cases studied pruritus was mild or
        moderate, and localized on the scalp, face, neck or upper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">torso</ENAMEX>. In a few cases it was severe and spread all over the
        body surface. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases pruritis was accompanied by a
        cutaneous rash, and no other clinical sign was
        observed.
      
      
        Discussion
        The development of pruritus, an important symptom of
        histamine release, is relatively frequent with vancomycin
        administration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. It generally appears alone, but
        sometimes it is associated with headache; flushing;
        erythematous rash over the face, neck and upper torso (the
        so-called 'red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>' syndrome); hypotension; and broncospasm
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important factors that
        impact on the incidence of these adverse reactions is the
        vancomycin infusion rate. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renz</ENAMEX> and coworkers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>] infused <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 g vancomycin over 10 min</NUMEX> to patients
        scheduled for elective prosthetic joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>, and
        found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had rash and pruritus, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
        had significant hypotension. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valero</ENAMEX> and coworkers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>] administered <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 g vancomycin over 30 min</NUMEX> to cardiac
        surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and observed hypotension in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of cases.
        For this reason, the international literature recommends
        that vancomycin be infused over a period of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 min</NUMEX> in order
        to prevent these side effects, and hypotension in
        particular, which in some cases manifests as
        life-threatening shock [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8, 9, 16</ENAMEX>].
        The present study was conducted to investigate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haemodynamic</ENAMEX> changes that occur following the appearance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pruritus</ENAMEX>. We therefore opted to administer vancomycin over
        a period of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX> in order to encourage appearance of the
        sign, as the coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were adequately monitored
        and the anaesthetist was therefore in the optimal
        conditions to detect and treat any change in
        cardiorespiratory function at an early stage.
        Our analysis of haemodynamic profiles shows that, in
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who exhibited pruritus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A), systemic
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> fell significantly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after
        initiation of vancomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This effect was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transient</ENAMEX>, disappearing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min later</TIMEX>. The reduction in
        systemic vascular resistance was not accompanied by a
        significant decrease in systemic arterial pressure, and
        because heart rate was unchanged, the increase in stroke
        volume offset the peripheral vasodilatation induced by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>. On the contrary, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> free from pruritus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group B</ENAMEX>), those haemodynamic changes were not observed and
        all of the parameters considered remained stable throughout
        the study. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A the normovolaemic condition of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids infused</ENAMEX> during the study
        undoubtedly contributed to haemodynamic compensation.
        However, it may be supposed that if vancomycin is
        administered to an hypovolaemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> then this
        compensation cannot be as effective and hypotension may
        occur. We were unable to confirm this for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons:
        first, hypovolaemia was among the exclusion criteria; and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, we considered exposure of a coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to the
        additional stress of relative hypovolaemia to be harmful.
        However, considering the different amounts of crystalloid
        infused in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we can indirectly deduce that fluid
        compensation contributed to the maintenance of stable
        values for mean systemic pressure when systemic vascular
        resistance decreased.
        The stability of heart rate in face of a reduction in
        systemic vascular resistance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> renders
        possible an influence of preoperative β-blocker therapy on
        haemodynamic compensation. Confirmation of this is
        indicated by the different trends of heart rate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were treated with a β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> as
        compared with those who were not. The stability of heart
        rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subgroup A1</TIMEX> and the significant increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subgroup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> represents proof that β-blocker therapy limited
        that compensatory mechanism to peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vasodilatation</ENAMEX>.
        Surprisingly, assessment of other haemodynamic parameters
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVRI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVI</ENAMEX>) revealed a significant change only in those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were affected by pruritus and not treated with
        a β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, as though treatment had antagonized all of the
        cardiovascular effects triggered by the release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histamine</ENAMEX> during vancomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. However,
        because the number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied was small, these
        findings require further investigation and confirmation in
        larger studies.
        The significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX> and decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by pruritus
        can be interpreted as the effect of an imbalance in the
        ventilation/perfusion ratio, induced by the vasodilating
        action of vancomycin on the pulmonary circulation, as
        supported by the significant reduction in pulmonary
        vascular resistance at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Also, the respiratory
        changes were significant only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">A</ENAMEX> who
        were not treated with a β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, whereas preopera-tive
        use of the drug eliminated any significant respiratory
        change. The degree of reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was moderate and had no important
        impact on arterial haemostasis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied, who
        showed however normal preoperative respiratory
        function.
        A limitation in the calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX> was that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were breathing room air during the study. In such
        conditions, apart from changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX>, the decrease
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may be caused by effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maldistribution</ENAMEX> in the ventilation/perfusion ratio. For
        this reason we must consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qsp/Qt</ENAMEX> not as an absolute
        value but as a relative one, but we can nevertheless
        attribute meaning to changes in this parameter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that
        occurrence of pruritus during vancomycin administration
        must be considered an alarm bell that indicates the
        presence of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vasodilatation</ENAMEX>. It can help the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> to identify at an early stage those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        are at risk for hypotension (e.g. hypovolaemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>) and
        to compensate for hypovolaemia before continuing
        administration of vancomycin. This benefit is useful not so
        much in intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        continuously and adequately monitored) as in medical and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgical</ENAMEX> departments overall, where monitoring of arterial
        pressure is not continuous and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> care is not as strict
        as in the intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, the lack of haemodynamic and respiratory
        changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by pruritus and treated
        with a β-blocker before surgery makes it probable that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can confer protection against the
        anaphylactoid reactions that are mediated by release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histamine</ENAMEX>.
