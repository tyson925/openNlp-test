        The epithelial component of normal and non-invasive
        breast tissues is normally surrounded by a layer of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myoepithelial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ME</ENAMEX>) cells, whose absence or disruption is an
        absolute prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . ME cells are not easily identifiable in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hematoxylin/eosin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&E</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">stained</NUMEX> breast tissue sections,
        as they are often indistinguishable from subjacent
        myofibroblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the stroma. Immunohistochemical
        staining for smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">actin</ENAMEX> (SMA) has been routinely
        used to assist in the identification of ME cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, we and others have repeatedly noted that about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> of morphologically recognizable ME cells in
        H&E-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">stained</NUMEX> sections fail to display SMA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . We attempted to assess whether
        these SMA-negative cells also lack the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        additional markers that are supposed to present exclusively
        or preferentially at ME cells.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Case selection
          Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from
          female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast lesions</ENAMEX> were retrieved from
          files of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Forces Institute of Pathology</ENAMEX>.
          Consecutive sections at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-5 μm</NUMEX> thickness were cut and
          placed on positively charged microscopic slides. A total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> cases with distinct ME cells, defined as a
          continuous layer of spindle- or cuboid-shaped cells that
          overlie the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> and encircle epithelial
          cells, were selected for this study. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> cases,
          all contained non-invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, including ductal and
          lobular carcinoma 
          in situ and sclerosing adenosis,
          and a few cases had invasive components.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markers</ENAMEX> and reagents
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> antibodies reported to present exclusively or
          preferentially at ME cells were selected for this study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX>
          ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>); these included antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX>,
          smooth muscle myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (SM-MHC), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD10</TIMEX>,
          calponin, protease inhibitor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (maspin), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilms</ENAMEX>' tumor-1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT-1</ENAMEX>), and cytokeratins <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CK5</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CK4</TIMEX>, and
          CK17). Other reagents, including the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>,
          detection kits, and chromogen kits, were purchased from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories, Inc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA). Digestion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> recommended for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX> were bought
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). A microwave oven and pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cooker</ENAMEX> designated for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX>, along with
          retrieval solutions, were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biocare Medical</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walnut Creek</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Immunohistochemical staining
          A preliminary study was performed to optimize the
          immunostaining condition for all antibodies selected.
          First, each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was tested strictly in
          accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommended protocol,
          including the methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX> and the length
          of the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> incubation time. Then, each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was tested with our published protocol, which
          involves an overnight incubation of deparaffinized
          sections at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">70°C</NUMEX> in the retrieval <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and an
          incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-4 hours</TIMEX> or overnight of the primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">about 25°C</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> adjacent sections
          stained by using our protocol and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          recommended protocols were compared for specificity and
          sensitivity. As our protocol consistently yielded
          stronger and more distinct staining for all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, the final staining for all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> cases with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> and a double immunostaining with additional markers
          in selected cases (see below) were performed with our
          published protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Double immunohistochemical staining
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E-stained</ENAMEX> and immunostained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          reviewed independently by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. All
          ducts lined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</NUMEX> epithelial cells were
          examined, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases were found to contain ducts
          that displayed morphologically distinct ME cell layers in
          H&E-stained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, but ME cells in at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the layer or the entire layer were devoid of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> staining. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> consecutive sections from each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> selected cases were used for a double
          immunostaining with our published protocols [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
          In brief, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> sections were first immunostained for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> with a black chromogen. Each section was then stained
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> additional ME markers with a red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromogen</ENAMEX>. The same ducts with SMA-negative ME cells were
          examined for the expression of other markers. In
          addition, sections from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cases were
          immunostained for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CK8</ENAMEX> to
          exclude the possibility that these SMA-negative cells
          might be epithelial in nature.
        
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Results showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cases spanned a
        morphologic spectrum ranging from columnar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> hyperplasia
        to ductal carcinoma 
        in situ . Case 1 (columnar cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperplasia</ENAMEX>) contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ducts of interest lined by about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> epithelial cells surrounded by morphologically distinct
        ME cell layers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E</ENAMEX>-stained section (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a).
        The ME cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the ME layer showed
        distinct and strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> immunostaining, whereas the cells
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of the layer were devoid of SMA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). The SMA-positive and SMA-negative
        cells were morphologically indistinguishable on
        H&E-stained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. In double immunostained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>,
        these SMA-negative cells were also negative for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM-MHC</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD10</TIMEX>, and calponin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c,1d<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,1e,1f</NUMEX>). However, these
        SMA-negative cells were positive for maspin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CK5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CK14</TIMEX>, and
        CK17 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1g<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,1h,1i,1j</NUMEX>).
        Cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 3</TIMEX> contained ductal carcinoma 
        in situ , of intermediate grade and
        low grade, respectively. The ducts were surrounded by
        morphologically distinct ME cell layers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E</ENAMEX>-stained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sections</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). These ME cell layers were attenuated,
        consisting of elongated spindle cells with dark and
        compressed nuclei. The entire ME cell layer was devoid of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> immunostaining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). In double immunostained
        sections, these SMA-negative cells were also devoid of
        distinct immunostaining for any of the additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c,2d<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,2e,2f</NUMEX>).
        The SMA-negative cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cases showed
        distinct negativity to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CK8</ENAMEX>, in sharp contrast with
        the overlying epithelial cells that showed strong <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and
        CK8 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positivities</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The distribution of
        these SMA-negative ME cells seemed to be independent of the
        ductal size, length, and architecture.
        Our findings are consistent with those of a recent study
        showing that a vast majority of the ME cells in both normal
        and ductal carcinoma 
        in situ displayed distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p63</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM-MHC</ENAMEX>, and calponin, whereas a
        single or a cluster of a few ME cells in some ducts failed
        to show immunoreactivity to all these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        . However, our study differs from this study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and
        previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> aspects: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the
        SMA-negative cells were segmented, accounting for at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> or all of the ME cells in involved ducts; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
        we tested for more ME cell markers; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the SMA-negative
        cells assessed were morphologically similar to their
        adjacent SMA-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> on H&E-stained
        sections; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, our focus is directed toward the
        elucidation of the detailed immunohistochemical profile of
        these SMA-negative cells identified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> examined
        cases. The distribution of different ME markers among
        normal, benign, and malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast lesions</ENAMEX> in the
        remaining cases will be presented separately. In our study,
        p63 was replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
        p63 is a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is not easily identifiable
        in attenuated or compressed ME cells; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, previous
        studies have shown that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is also expressed in
        ME-cell-derived neoplasms and tumors with squamous cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, our preliminary study had
        showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX> had the same subcellular localization but
        seemed to be more specific for ME cells, compared with p63
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        The mechanism of the loss of myoepithelial markers in
        some of the ME cells is unknown, but could result from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamic</ENAMEX> and reciprocal interactions between epithelial and
        ME cells. It has been documented that a variety of
        proteolytic enzymes produced by malignant epithelial cells
        could have substantial impacts on the physical integrity or
        functions of the subjacent ME cells and the basement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, ME cells could
        influence the biological behavior of subjacent epithelial
        cells. Our recent studies have revealed the co-localization
        of maspin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT-1</ENAMEX> exclusively in mammary ME cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        In a vast majority of cases, the expression of these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins decreases linearly</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor progression</ENAMEX>, and the
        loss of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or focal disruptions in the ME cell
        layers leads to a significantly higher cell proliferation
        in the subjacent epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 33</NUMEX> ] . In addition,
        these changes in ME cells could result from effects of
        certain chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX>.
        It has been reported that the exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lambdacarrageenan</ENAMEX> could specifically result in filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembly</ENAMEX> and loss of ME cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
        exposure to oxytocin could substantially enhance ME cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and proliferation in mouse breasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        In addition, these SMA-negative ME cells might be newly
        formed through stem-cell-mediated proliferation and are in
        the transition to a terminally differentiated status. Our
        previous studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models have shown that
        intercalated duct cells in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat submandibular</ENAMEX> glands
        are the common progenitor for both the acinar and granular
        duct cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 36</NUMEX> ] . A recent study in human breast has
        revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CK5</NUMEX>-positive cells are capable of giving rise
        to both glandular and ME cell lineages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In both
        cases the intermediate cells showed an unusual
        immunostaining pattern for several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 36</NUMEX> ] .
        The total loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> ME cell immunophenotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">markers</ENAMEX> suggests that these ME cells have genetic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> properties differing from their SMA-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. The significance and consequence of these
        changes in ME cells are unknown. However, given that the
        disruption of the ME cell layer and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> is an
        absolute prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis,
        these alterations in ME cells might affect the biological
        behavior of the epithelial cells, making them prone to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. Our assumption is in agreement with our
        previous findings, which have revealed that focal
        disruptions of ME cell layers could lead to a significantly
        higher proliferation rate in subjacent epithelial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 33</NUMEX> ] . Our assumption is also supported by a recent
        study showing that normal and tumor-derived ME cells differ
        substantially in their ability to interact with luminal
        breast epithelial cells for polarity and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> membrane
        deposition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Further studies are currently in
        progress to elucidate the biological behavior and genetic
        profile of epithelial cells immediately subjacent to these
        SMA-negative ME cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        A subset of morphologically identifiable ME cells lacks
        the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> corresponding immunophenotypic
        markers, suggesting that, like the epithelial cells, ME
        cells might also be subject to different normal and
        pathological alterations, and that alterations in ME cells
        might significantly affect the functions and biological
        behavior of the adjacent epithelial cells.
