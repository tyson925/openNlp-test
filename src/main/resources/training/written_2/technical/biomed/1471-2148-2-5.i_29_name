        The potential adaptive significance of transposable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (TEs) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genomes in which they reside is
        a topic that has been hotly debated by molecular
        evolutionists for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two decades</TIMEX>. While the
        biological importance of TEs seemed self-evident to those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> involved in their initial discovery [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        ] ], the subsequent realization that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> could be
        maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> even while imparting slight
        selective disadvantage to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] ]
        drew into question the presumption of adaptive
        significance. However, even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> can be maintained in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> on a day-to-day basis without providing
        selective advantage, it does not preclude the possibility
        that the insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> in or near <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may, in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, be of adaptive advantage.
        If TE insertion variants have contributed to adaptive
        gene evolution, such variants might be expected to be in
        high frequency or fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Initial
        surveys of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of 
        Drosophila melanogaster showing that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TE</ENAMEX> insertion alleles are in uniformly low frequency seemed
        to negate the adaptive hypothesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, the
        sporadic discovery of degenerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> or TE fragments as
        critical components of functional genes in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was sufficient to keep the adaptive hypothesis
        alive throughout the pre-genomic era [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        The current availability of the complete or nearly
        complete sequence of select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> representing a variety
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is providing an unprecedented opportunity to
        examine the frequency and distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> in eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. The results have been dramatic. TEs not only
        comprise a significant fraction of nearly all eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> thus far sequenced, they have been found to be
        components of the regulatory and/or coding regions of a
        surprisingly large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ]. For
        example, a recent genomic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,799</NUMEX> human genes
        revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4%</NUMEX> harbored retrotransposon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Similar
        results have been recently reported for the nematode 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Here
        we analyze the polymorphism of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrotransposon</ENAMEX> /
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> across geographically widespread 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative population</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sibling species</ENAMEX>, 
        Drosophila mauritiana .
      
      
        Results
        We have initiated a genomic analysis of LTR
        retrotransposons present in the 
        Drosophila melanogaster genome [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>,
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ]. Of particular interest is identification of genes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harboring TEs</ENAMEX> and determining if these insertion alleles
        are in high frequency or fixed among natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> as
        would be expected from the adaptive hypothesis. We report
        here the results of an analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> LTR
        retrotransposon-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> located on the second
        chromosome of the sequenced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster y; cn bw sp strain.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> present an interesting contrast in that one
        of them, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chitinase</ENAMEX> 3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cht3</NUMEX>) , is located
        within constitutive heterochromatin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> accession:
        AE002743) while the other, 
        cathD , is located in a euchromatic
        region of the chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> accession: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AE003839</ENAMEX>). Our
        findings demonstrate that while the euchromatic 
        cathD insertion variant was not
        detected in any of the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> examined, the
        insertion variant present in the heterochromatic 
        Cht3 gene was found to be apparently
        fixed throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. These results are consistent
        with the view that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> in constitutive
        heterochromatin may have relevance to the expression of
        heterochromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] ].
        Genomic analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequenced y</ENAMEX>; 
        cn bw sp strain of 
        Drosophila melanogaster identified a
        full-length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burdock LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retrotransposon</ENAMEX> located
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 3</TIMEX>' to the 
        cathD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">359bp</NUMEX> LTR fragment
        (complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">659 bp</ENAMEX>) of an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antonia LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrotransposon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        located within an intron of the 
        Cht3 gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A set of PCR
        primers were designed to amplify regions of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        retrotransposon sequences. Appropriate pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and
        element primers were used to detect the presence or absence
        of the respective retrotransposon inserts associated with
        each gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> geographically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispersed populations</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster . The results
        presented in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and Table 1demonstrate</ENAMEX> that while the 
        Burdock insertion located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just 3</NUMEX>' to 
        cathD gene is not present in any of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> strains representing a geographically diverse sampling
        of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antonia LTR</ENAMEX> fragment located in the
        intron of the heterochromatic 
        Cht3 gene is fixed in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> strains
        tested.
        It is formally possible that the presence of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antonia LTR</ENAMEX> within the 
        Cht3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> was the result of a
        chance fixation event prior to the expansion of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster around the world.
        Thus, to further test the adaptive hypothesis we compared
        the level of sequence divergence within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> and its
        flanking intronic sequence between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sibling species 
        Drosophila melanogaster and 
        Drosophila mauritiana . If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>-containing intron is under stabilizing selection, a
        lower than neutral rate of substitution would be expected.
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">685 bp</NUMEX> of the 
        Cht3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> was sequenced. This
        region spans <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">264 bp</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">359 bp</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antonia LTR</ENAMEX> fragment. The sequence of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dimonika</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>)
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> mauritiana (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauritius</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>)
        strain was aligned with the homologous region in the
        sequenced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster y; cn bw sp strain
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
        melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
        identical. The 
        melanogaster sequences were found to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 substitutions/685</NUMEX> nucleotide sites)
        diverged from that of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> mauritiana . This value is
        significantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> of the expected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> (Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>)
        divergence based on the 
        Drosophila neutral substitution rate
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.016 (Â± 0.005</NUMEX>) substitutions/site/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">million year</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated 2.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> separating the two
        species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        To directly compare the substitution rate for the 
        Cht3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> with that of another 
        Drosophila gene intron, we randomly
        selected intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adh</ENAMEX> ) gene. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adh</ENAMEX> is a widely studied 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and it has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> in several 
        Drosophila species including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , accession X60793 [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> mauritiana , accession M19264 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] . The sequence divergence between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> mauritiana in the 
        Adh intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9%</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), is
        higher than that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTR</ENAMEX> containing 
        Cht3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3%</NUMEX>). These results
        strongly suggest that conservative selection has been
        operating on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTR</ENAMEX> containing intron associated with the 
        Drosophila Cht3 gene over the past
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, constitutive heterochromatin was
        considered to be of little or no functional significance [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] . This view seemed to be supported by early molecular
        studies showing that heterochromatin consists almost
        exclusively of highly repeated and middle repetitive DNA
        [e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] ]. The middle repetitive fraction was
        viewed as the descendent of once active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEs</ENAMEX> that had the
        misfortune of inserting into transcriptionally inert
        heterochromatin at some point in their evolutionary history
        [e.g., [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 20</ENAMEX> ] ]. The view of heterochromatin as a genetic
        wasteland gradually changed with the mapping of a number of
        functionally important 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to constitutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31</NUMEX> ] ].
        Reexamination of 
        Drosophila constitutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> revealed that long stretches of highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX> are interrupted by "islands" of
        retrotransposon sequences [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] ]. 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in heterochromatin
        are typically associated with these islands of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 31 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . It has been suggested
        that transposable elements inserted into heterochromatin
        may locally alter chromatin structure [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ]. Our
        results suggest that in at least some instances, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterochromatic genes</ENAMEX> with transposable
        element sequences may be of adaptive significance.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results presented here are consistent with the
        hypothesis that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">359</NUMEX> bp fragment of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonia</ENAMEX> retrotransposon located
        within the intron of the heterochromatic 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanogaster</ENAMEX> Cht3 gene may
        be of adaptive evolutionary significance. Further genomic
        and molecular analyses will be required to assess the
        general importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposon sequences to the
        evolution of heterochromatic gene structure and
        function.
