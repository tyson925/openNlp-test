        Gene duplications are traditionally considered to be a
        major evolutionary source of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions. The
        conventional view, pioneered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susumu Ohno</ENAMEX>, holds that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX> produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functionally redundant,
        paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and thereby frees one of them from
        selective constraints. This unconstrained paralog is then
        free to accumulate neutral mutations that would have been
        deleterious in a unique gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Although the most likely
        outcome of such neutral evolution is for one of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> to fix a null mutation and become a pseudogene,
        there is also the possibility of fixation of mutations that
        lead to a new function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the predictions of the conventional model of
        evolution of duplicated genes is the rapid loss of paralogs
        due to null mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 5, 7</ENAMEX>]. However, this
        prediction was not supported by studies on isozyme spectra
        of polyploids in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]).
        Furthermore, a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> pairs of duplicated genes in the
        tetraploid frog 
        Xenopus laevis has shown that both
        copies were subject to purifying selection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], contrary
        to the notion of neutrality of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the copies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The
        failure of empirical research to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has
        led to the proposal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative hypotheses.
        The 'subfunctionalization' hypothesis is based on the
        same assumption as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, namely that duplicated
        genes are redundant in function and, accordingly, a
        duplication event is selectively neutral [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 10</ENAMEX>]. However,
        it was argued that, as natural selection does not 'know'
        which duplicated gene should be under selection and which
        is free of selective constraint, both paralogs experience a
        period of relaxed selection and accelerated evolution.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might accumulate mutations
        that impair different functions of the ancestral gene, so
        that, after a certain point, none of the paralogs is
        capable of substituting for the ancestor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 10</ENAMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hypothesis holds that a gene duplication that
        leads to a new function is preceded by a period of 'gene
        sharing', such that the original, unduplicated gene encodes
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct functions. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs of such a
        bifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are produced by duplication, each may be
        driven by positive selection to specialize in one of these
        functions, which it performs more efficiently than the
        ancestor gene, leading to the creation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> indispensable
        genes with distinct functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        The strong interest in the evolution of gene
        duplications stems from the notion that duplication leads
        to new functions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 12, 13</ENAMEX>]. With the increasing
        availability of genomic data, it became clear that numerous
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have diverged in function through series of
        duplications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>], including many lineage-specific
        expansions identified in each of the genomes sequenced [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. Such creation of novel gene functions
        obviously provides a long-term, but not a short-term [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]
        advantage for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Duplicated genes</ENAMEX> have also been observed to affect
        fitness immediately after duplication (see Discussion),
        providing a short-term advantage for duplication. Although
        these observations remained largely unnoticed by
        evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> investigating the evolution of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, such short-term advantage is crucial to the
        long-term fate of a duplication as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> selection favoring
        a duplication because of its long-term advantage cannot
        overcome the individual selection that depends exclusively
        on short-term effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. A recent genome-wide analysis
        of duplicated genes of eukaryotes has suggested that they
        evolve under purifying selection, with an apparent early
        phase of relaxed constraint or even near-neutrality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        Here we show that the same pattern of purifying selection
        is observed among bacterial and archaeal paralogs and
        demonstrate that amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> substitution rate is greater in
        paralogs than in orthologs with the same level of
        divergence at synonymous sites. We also present evidence in
        support of genome-wide short-term advantage of duplicated
        genes, and discuss its relevance to the evolution of new
        gene functions.
      
      
        Results
        We identified recent gene duplications in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> bacterial,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> archaeal and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> complete genomes, two
        completely sequenced chromosomes from 
        Arabidopsis , and among the available
        sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> - human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Because the duplications were identified
        through the similarity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), this procedure primarily, if
        not exclusively, detected functional genes rather than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>. For comparison, orthologs with no apparent
        recent duplications were identified in pairs of closely
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, namely the bacteria 
        Chlamydia trachomatis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> muridarum (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX> orthologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX>)and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains of 
        Helicobacter pylori (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,202</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> pairs), and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mammals (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,428</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> pairs).
        Selection was measured in terms of the ratio of the rate
        of nonsynonymous substitutions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ), which are usually subject to
        selective pressure, to the rate of synonymous substitutions
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ), which are assumed to be (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly</NUMEX>)
        neutral. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is assumed to indicate
        neutrality, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s ></ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is a signature of positive
        selection at the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> level, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s <</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is indicative of purifying
        selection, which is the most common mode of selection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. Such analysis is applicable to homologs with a
        relatively low level of divergence, in which synonymous
        substitutions have not yet reached saturation.
        In all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> analyzed, the nonsynonymous substitution
        rate was significantly lower than the synonymous
        substitution rate, such that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s << 1</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>,band <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
        in agreement with the recent genome-wide study of paralogs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Pairwise comparisons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> values for different clades revealed
        that the strength of selection was generally similar in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacterial</ENAMEX>, archaeal and eukaryotic sets of paralogous
        genes, although apparently stronger selection was observed
        among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast paralogs</ENAMEX> and weaker selection was seen in
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">paralogs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2</ENAMEX>).
        The observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n << K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> for most of the recently diverged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> is, in itself, not sufficient to conclude that
        both paralogs in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> are subject to purifying
        selection. The same result would have been obtained if, in
        accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX>'s original model, one of the paralogs
        was free from selective constraints, whereas the other one
        was maintained by purifying selection. Therefore, we
        carried out a relative rate test on amino-acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] on those pairs of paralogs, for which
        an ortholog was available that was more distant from either
        of the paralogs than the paralogs were from each other
        (orthologs that were too distant to be used for the
        relative rate test were discarded; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        methods). A comparison of the evolutionary distances
        between each of the paralogs and the ortholog used as an
        outgroup showed that, of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> analyzed pairs,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only five</NUMEX> evolve at significantly ( 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) different rate. The
        proportions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">paralogous</NUMEX> pairs that evolved at
        significantly different rates in each of the analyzed
        clades are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Thus, in the majority of cases
        at least, both paralogs evolved under similar levels of
        purifying selection, in agreement with the results of an
        early analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> pairs of paralogs from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> laevis and a more recent analysis
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> pairs of paralogs in human and teleost lineages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>].
        We next sought to compare the strength of purifying
        selection acting on paralogs to that acting on orthologs
        with the same level of sequence divergence, which were
        identified as bidirectional best hits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between two</TIMEX>
        pairs of bacterial genomes ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. trachomatis-C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muridarum</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs of
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (human-mouse, human-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse-rat</ENAMEX>).
        The results of this comparison indicated that paralogs were
        subject to significantly weaker purifying selection than
        similarly diverged orthologs (compare Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1aand c</ENAMEX>; band
        d). Specifically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio for orthologs was approximately
        twice the ratio for paralogs in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the ratio for paralogs in mammals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Because we restricted our gene comparisons to cases in
        which the synonymous divergence rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) did not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 substitutions</NUMEX> per
        site, a substantial part of the human-rodent orthologous
        comparisons was excluded from the analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>). The
        use of the orthologous comparisons with a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> , and thus with potentially stronger
        selection in the synonymous sites, could, in principle,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> our comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio. To rule out this possibility,
        we calculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio for the center of the rodent
        orthologous comparisons (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15</NUMEX> < <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.25</NUMEX>) and compared it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio of paralogs within the same
        range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> . The difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio in this range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.448</NUMEX> in paralogs versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.175</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX>) was not substantially dif ferent from the
        difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratios for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> < <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Extrapolating this
        observation to the human-rodent comparisons, it appears
        most likely that the exclusion of the human-rodent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> pairs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s > 0.5</ENAMEX> did not substantially bias
        the results.
        Weak selection acting on synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or differences
        in mutation bias among related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> might potentially
        result in homogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        genome, which would translate into a much greater
        heterogeneity of codon vocabulary in orthologous genes
        compared to paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Under this scenario,
        synonymous divergence could be substantially underestimated
        for paralogous, but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX> in our
        dataset, falsely suggesting an acceleration of evolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> (larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> values) in paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. If there
        was such homogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> should show a greater correlation between codon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> values than orthologs. This prediction
        is not supported by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">linear least-square regressions</NUMEX>, which
        fail to detect any substantial differences in the
        correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and codon bias in paralogous versus
        orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (data not shown), suggesting that the
        observation of a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratio in paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> cannot be
        explained by an underestimate of synonymous divergence in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX>.
        Because genes with different functions evolve at
        different rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>], the observed relaxation of
        selection in paralogs could potentially be due to an
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-representation of fast-evolving genes in the
        paralogous gene set. In an attempt to isolate the effect of
        duplication 
        per se on purifying selection, we
        analyzed paralogs and orthologs that appeared to encode
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with similar functions, namely secreted and
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that were identified by signal peptide
        and transmembrane helix prediction. The difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
        s ratios for paralogous versus
        orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was approximately the same for the
        predicted secreted and membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as it was for the
        complete analyzed gene sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), indicating that the
        acceleration of evolution probably is an inherent feature
        of duplicated genes.
      
      
        Discussion
        The present analysis confirms the earlier observations
        that paralogs evolve under purifying selection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], which
        typically acts with similar strength on both duplicated
        copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 22</ENAMEX>]. Additionally, however, we found
        that paralogs evolve significantly faster than unduplicated
        genes with a similar level of divergence, which is
        compatible with the notion that gene duplications are a
        source of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions.
        The inconsistency of empirical evidence with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX>'s
        model prompts questions on the validity of some of the
        assumptions underlying this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major assumption,
        which was inherited by the subfunctionalization model, is
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene copy is sufficient to perform the respective
        function, so that a gene duplication is redundant and has
        no effect on fitness [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 10</ENAMEX>]. This notion has been widely
        accepted, and often becomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the central postulates
        of models of duplicated gene evolution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 7, 26, 27</ENAMEX>].
        Should this be the case, however, a duplication event would
        only very rarely achieve fixation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>]; moreover, in
        the event that a duplication is slightly deleterious, it
        would be effectively prevented from achieving fixation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>].
        Although the notion of duplication producing redundant
        genes is central to current theories of duplicated gene
        evolution, the short-term benefits of gene duplications are
        well known. This is illustrated by the numerous
        observations of adaptive gene amplifications in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33</TIMEX>], anticancer drug treatments and
        exposure to various toxins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>] or
        heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 42, 43, 44</TIMEX>], nutrient limitations [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide</ENAMEX> treatments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>], extreme temperatures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55</TIMEX>] and symbiotic and
        parasitic interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56, 57</TIMEX>]. Combining this
        information with the observations that recently duplicated
        genes evolve under purifying selection ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and our
        present work), it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a
        majority of duplicated genes that achieve fixation in a
        population increase fitness when present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
        copies in a genome and thus are subject to purifying
        selection from the moment of duplication.
        Recently duplicated paralogs appear to be a nonrandom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> enriched in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> coding for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
        different aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>' interaction with the
        environment (see Additional data files). In particular, a
        substantial fraction of these paralogs encode (predicted)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> or secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The prevalent functions of
        duplicated genes varied among different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the majority of these genes encoded different
        types of surface molecules, which, in pathogens, are
        involved in interaction with substrate cells. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        there was an emphasis on membrane transporters as well as
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in stress response (for example, heat
        shock). In multicellular eukaryotes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (for
        example, olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>) and (predicted) secreted
        signaling molecules were predominant. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> with a
        predicted signal peptide were more prevalent in 
        Arabidopsis thaliana (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">paralogs</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of all unduplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteome</ENAMEX>), 
        Caenorhabditis elegans (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">paralogs</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> among unduplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and 
        Drosophila melanogaster (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">paralogs</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> in orthologs) and predicted membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were more numerous in mammals (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> in paralogs
        versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> in unduplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). Each of these
        differences in the functional composition of the sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> and unduplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were statistically highly
        significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">χ 2test</ENAMEX>).
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which amplification has been shown
        to have a role in adaptation to various conditions were
        among the recent duplicates in our dataset. Examples
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hexose</ENAMEX> transporter, whose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> has been shown to increase fitness in a
        low-glucose environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>], the nematode P-glycoprotein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, the classical eukaryotic multidrug-resistance gene [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>], and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit fly copper</ENAMEX>-binding metallothionein gene
        whose duplication is implicated in copper tolerance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>]. Many genes that are known to amplify in response to
        selection, primarily during anticancer drug treatments,
        were found to be present in multiple copies in mammalian
        genomes as well, in particular, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,
        glutamine synthetase and other anabolic enzymes, adenosine
        deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> deaminase, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -acetyl glucosaminyltransferase [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 46</TIMEX>]. Permeases, transporters, synthetases and various
        detoxification enzymes, which, in general, tend to amplify
        as a response to stressful conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 34, 46, 48</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>], also showed a substantial presence among the recently
        duplicated genes in all species (see Additional data
        files). Duplication of genes belonging to these functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> is thought to be adaptive because increase in the
        production of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may either
        increase the efficiency of transport of a nutrient into the
        cell or of toxins out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, increase the rate of
        catabolism of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, or allow a greater rate of
        synthesis of metabolites, for example amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, that are
        required in increased amounts under the given conditions [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 34, 46, 48, 51</TIMEX>].
        Thus, the observation that purifying selection appears
        to act on all recent duplicates and examination of the
        functions of recently duplicated genes do not support the
        notion that gene duplication results in true functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX> and duplications may achieve fixation despite
        being redundant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The alternative hypothesis - that
        gene duplications are fixed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> by positive
        selection in all organisms - is supported by a combination
        of evidence of adaptive duplications from many types of
        living organisms: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 33, 45, 46, 48, 50, 55</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>], protists [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 58, 59</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 44</TIMEX>], fungi [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>], invertebrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 51, 52, 53</TIMEX>], non-mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>], as well as mammalian somatic tissues [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 36, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. Combining these observations with the
        suggestion that gene duplication may be a general mechanism
        of adaptation to various conditions of environmental stress
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 46, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 60</TIMEX>], we suggest that,
        in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most paralogs that are
        fixed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> have a direct effect on fitness from
        the moment of duplication, and aid in the adaptation to
        various environmental conditions, primarily through a
        protein dosage effect.
        That the short-term benefit of a gene duplication is a
        direct effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> dosage also stems from a variety
        of experimental observations in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotic</ENAMEX> and eukaryotic. Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> may be a
        temporary mechanism to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA dosage</ENAMEX>, as
        in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rRNA genes</ENAMEX> in amphibian oocytes and ciliate
        macronuclei, the chorion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in some dipterans, actin
        genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> as well as drug transporters in somatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 37</TIMEX>] for reviews). Protein dosage effects
        have also been demonstrated in a number of other studies of
        inheritable adaptive gene duplications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 34, 35, 43</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 46, 49, 51, 53, 61</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, there is evidence
        from the analysis of the yeast genome that duplicated genes
        tend to be from those sets of functions that are more
        highly expressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>], supporting a general role for
        selection on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein dosage</ENAMEX> in duplicated genes.
        We show here a substantial acceleration of evolution in
        recently diverged paralogs compared to orthologs with the
        same level of synonymous sequence divergence. This
        acceleration may be explained by positive selection or by a
        relaxation of purifying selection or by a combination of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. A few cases of differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">paralogs</ENAMEX> driven
        by positive selection have been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63, 64, 65</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>]; however, such cases are notoriously difficult to
        uncover. Thus, we make no attempt here to examine in
        greater detail the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that act on duplicated
        genes. In general, however, only a small fraction of sites
        in some genes appears to evolve under positive selection [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>], and relaxation of purifying selection is likely to be
        the main mechanism behind the acceleration of evolution
        after duplication.
        Our claim of the prevalence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> dosage effect
        as the short-term advantage of duplicated genes is not
        incompatible with the possibility of a long-term advantage
        in terms of new functions or the observation that
        duplicated genes evolve at a faster rate. Indeed, evolution
        of a new beneficial function in one of the duplicates, once
        a relatively high level of divergence (which will be
        different for different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, depending on the specific
        function involved) is reached, appears to be common among
        duplicated genes as demonstrated for several paralogous
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 52, 54, 67</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inasmuch</ENAMEX> as this happens,
        positive selection might contribute to the observed
        acceleration of evolution in duplicated genes.
        However, assuming that gene duplications primarily
        evolve under purifying selection, at least soon after
        duplication, the observed acceleration of evolution may be
        explained by epistatic interaction between gene copies. In
        the absence of epistasis, a fitness function is an
        exponential function that depends on a single additive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> called fitness potential [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68, 69, 70, 71</TIMEX>].
        Assuming that the acceleration of evolution observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> is primarily due to a relaxation of purifying
        selection, the fitness potential variable describing the
        fitness function of diverging gene copies can be thought of
        as the effective amount of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which
        depends both on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX> and point mutations.
        Assuming that all point mutations are equally deleterious,
        such that it takes, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> point mutations to
        eliminate the increase in the amount of functional protein
        resulting from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> duplication, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = 
        d - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/10</ENAMEX> , where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> is the fitness potential, 
        d is the number of gene copies and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is the number of deleterious point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. By definition, in the absence of epistasis,
        selection against a deleterious mutation is constant for
        all values of the fitness potential.
        However, if a fitness function grows at a less than
        exponential rate, then a relaxation of selection against
        deleterious mutations is expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68, 69, 70, 71</TIMEX>]. For
        example, consider a linear fitness function f( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> . In this case, the fitness of an
        organism with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene copy is f( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and the fitness of the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point mutation is f( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>( 
        d - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m /10</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 - 1/10</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>; thus the
        mutation reduced fitness by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 - 1.8/2</NUMEX>). The fitness of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene copies is f( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the fitness of the same
        organism with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene copies and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point mutation is f( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 - 1/10</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>; in this
        case, the same mutation will cause only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitness</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-3.8/4</NUMEX>). Thus, the observed acceleration of
        evolution in paralogous genes implies that either their
        divergence occurs under positive selection or that the
        fitness function for gene duplications grows at a slower
        than exponential rate.
        Experimental evidence from several organisms supports
        the notion that the increase of fitness due to gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> is far from being exponential; more
        specifically, under static environmental conditions, there
        is an optimal gene copy number [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50, 53</TIMEX>]. As
        duplication events are known to incur a fitness cost [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>], the fitness function of duplicated genes most probably
        resembles an inverted parabola, such that it contains a
        clearly defined maximum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 53</TIMEX>]. Numerous observations
        that gene duplications that increase protein dosage can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61, 72, 73, 74, 75</TIMEX>] further support the model
        of optimum copy number for each gene.
        Thus, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that, for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, there is an optimum number of copies per genome that
        may vary depending on environmental conditions. Assuming
        that the environmental condition that determines the
        optimum gene number fluctuates, positive selection would
        regulate the gene copy number in the genome accordingly.
        Under this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, if environmental conditions, and
        therefore the number of gene copies, fluctuate frequently,
        then most paralogs will be closely related, such that an
        excess of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly</NUMEX>) identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be found within a
        genome, as indeed has been observed for many genomes ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]
        and data not shown).
        The present observation that duplicated genes experience
        a substantial relaxation of selection compared to
        unduplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is compatible with the traditional view
        that gene duplications make a major contribution to the
        evolution of new gene functions. Additionally, the
        repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions among recent duplicates
        suggests that many gene duplications contribute to
        adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> to various forms of
        environmental stress. The results of the present analysis
        of recent duplications suggest a two-stage evolutionary
        model of gene duplication: in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage, immediately
        after duplication and during the early phase of their
        evolution, paralogs are retained and are subject to
        purifying selection because of the short-term advantage of
        protein dosage regulation; at a later stage in their
        evolution, gene duplications are likely to provide a
        long-term advantage by enabling the creation of new
        functions.

          nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) were estimatedusing the
          Pamilo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bianchi-Li</ENAMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80, 81</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> of paralogs
          that included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were separated into all
          possible pairs, and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was subjected to the same
          analysis, after which an average of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> was taken and used as a single
          point. However, only paralogous clusters with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          paralogs were used for the relative rate test. For the
          substitution rate calculations, the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">genomes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> archaeal genomes and three
          mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX> were combined into three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>-specific datasets; the remaining eukaryotic
          genomes were analyzed independently. The substitution
          rates for orthologous gene pairs were calculated using
          the same approach. Pairs of paralogs and orthologs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> and database-annotation errors, were excluded
          from all calculations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /K</ENAMEX> 
          s ratios.
          For the relative rate test, the closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ortholog</ENAMEX> from
          the same taxon was identified for each pair of paralogs.
          To ensure correct identification, those ortholog

          than the paralogs were to each other were discarded. In
