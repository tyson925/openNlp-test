        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. The
        general term vitamin E refers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> naturally occurring
        and synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tocopherols</ENAMEX> and tocotrienols and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">succinate</ENAMEX> derivatives. Although the naturally
        occurring forms of vitamin E have lipid-soluble antioxidant
        properties that protect cell membranes against damage by
        free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>, the acetate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">succinate</ENAMEX> derivatives that
        are esterified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-6</ENAMEX> position of the chromanol ring do
        not have antioxidant properties unless the esterification
        is hydrolyzed and free tocopherol is regenerated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Synthetic vitamin E, a form of vitamin E commonly used
        as a dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplement</ENAMEX>, is the form used in the 
        in vivo studies reported here. It is
        a mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> stereoisomers in equal amounts
        designated "dl" or all-rac tocopherol and does have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidant</ENAMEX> properties [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, different forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> can have different antioxidant properties as well
        as differences in their absorption, distribution, and
        metabolism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . There are also reports that some forms
        of vitamin E have activity against cancer cells 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5</NUMEX> ] . For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tocotrienol</ENAMEX> and vitamin E succinate are reported to have
        antiproliferative activity in human cancer cells whereas
        some forms of vitamin E are reported to induce apoptosis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell types but not in normal cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Specifically, these apoptogenic forms include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRR</ENAMEX>-Î±-tocopheryl succinate and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRR</ENAMEX>-Î´-tocopherol while the
        Î±, Î², and Î³ tocopherol and acetate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> of
        tocopherol were not apoptogenic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . There are few
        reports on the use of vitamin E for treating tumorous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cancers</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo but the results are
        inconsistent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . It is therefore essential
        that the form of vitamin E used in any research study as
        well as the dosage and the mode of administration be
        defined.
        The study reported on here was originally designed to
        test the ability of a high dietary dose of sE to prevent
        lipid peroxidation in nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> bearing a human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> xenograft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . To assure
        suppression of lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>, sE was added to the diet
        at a dose level. For example, the vitamin E requirement for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> when all-rac-Î±-tocopherol acetate is used as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dietary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> for diets in which lipids
        comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 percent</NUMEX> of the diet [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">900 mg/kg</ENAMEX> diet used in this study is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> fold higher than
        this estimated requirement. This is in contrast to human
        recommendations which are given in mg of Î±-tocopherol
        equivalents with the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and the
        upper limit set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> mg/day. The observed antitumor
        activity of this sE dietary supplementation was an
        unexpected experimental result as sE was not previously
        reported to have antitumor activity although vitamin E may
        give modest protection against the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . Based on the observed antitumor activity of high dose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sE</ENAMEX> in the diet, it became important to investigate if the
        sE supplement, when fed at such a high dose, was associated
        with the modification of the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> and microsomal membranes and if the sE was
        acting as an antioxidant or possibly a prooxidant in tumor
        and in host tissues. Given that such a high dose of sE has
        antitumor activity, it also became important to look for
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX>-effects in host tissues prior to further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preclinical</ENAMEX> trials.
      
      
        Results
        
          Tumor growth
          The mean tumor growth rate was calculated using linear
          regression analysis of mean tumor size over time. After
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of dietary intervention, the mean growth rate
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed the sE supplement was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> that
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> not fed the sE supplement however this difference
          was not quite significant at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> level. Tumor
          growth rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> not sacrificed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> of
          dietary intervention was followed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional four</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Analysis of mean tumor growth rate for the entire
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 days</TIMEX> of intervention revealed that the mean tumor
          growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed the sE supplement was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> slower
          than the mean tumor growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> not fed the sE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplement</ENAMEX> (significant at p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> as illustrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Lipid peroxidation
          Tumor and host tissue malondialdehyde and
          malondialdehyde by-products were analyzed by the
          thiobarbituric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid reactive substrates</ENAMEX> (TBARS) assay to
          estimate the extent of lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
          of intervention. The TBARS findings are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The mean value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> was significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>) lower in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and in the liver of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed
          sE but was not significantly different (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>) in
          the colon.
        
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of microsomal and of
          mitochondrial membranes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on the percent of the total fatty acid
          composition for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linoleic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>), for arachidonic acid
          (AA), and for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">docosahexanoic acid</ENAMEX> (DHA) in the microsomal
          and in the mitochondrial fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>,
          and of colon after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of dietary intervention both
          with and without sE supplementation are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The mean levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> were lower in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsomal</ENAMEX> and mitochondrial fractions of the tumor, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, and the colon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed sE than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without
          the sE. That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mean values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> were lower with sE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX> indicates a consistent pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane LA</ENAMEX> composition change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> tissues. Conversely, the mean level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> was
          higher in the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of
          the tumor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, and the colon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed sE than
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without the sE supplement. That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mean
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> were higher with sE supplementation
          indicates a consistent pattern of membrane DHA change in
          the tumor and in the host tissues. The mean level of AA
          in the membrane fractions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tissues was not
          consistently changed.
          To further explore the effect of sE supplementation on
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid composition</ENAMEX>, the relative level of
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> in each fraction of each
          tissue was expressed as a ratio of the level with sE
          supplement over the level without sE supplement. The
          results of this exercise are plotted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The ratio
          is consistently lower than unity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> (mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.70</NUMEX>) and
          consistently higher than unity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> (mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9</NUMEX>). The
          mean ratio for AA was near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, indicating no significant
          difference.
        
        
          Body weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on change in body weights at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> from the body weight at the start of dietary
          intervention are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The mean values
          for change in body weights at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> are not
          significantly different due to diet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight loss
          observed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> can be attributed to the presence
          of the growing tumor.
        
        
          Blood counts
          Results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> counts, as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>,
          reveal no significant differences in white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (WBC), in
          red blood cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBC</ENAMEX>) or in platelet (PLT) numbers due to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of sE supplementation.
        
        
          Colon histology
          Colon crypt height expressed in number of cells from
          the crypt base to the crypt mouth was scored as an
          indicator of damage attributable to sE supplementation.
          The crypt column heights, (number of cells, mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>)
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21.24 Â± 0.54</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without the sE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21.63 Â± 0.51</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sE</ENAMEX> supplementation. These means are not significantly
          different. No histological differences attributable to
          the dietary intervention with sE were observed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Heart histopathology</ENAMEX> and antioxidant enzyme gene
          expression
          Histological cross-sections of the heart taken
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the distance from the apex were studied for
          indications of side-effects of high dietary levels of sE.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vacuole</ENAMEX> formation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac myocytes</ENAMEX> has been used
          as a marker of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cardiotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The mean percent
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> myocytes with one or more vacuoles in the
          subendocardial myocytes of the left ventricle was
          significantly (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed the sE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplement</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Based on this indication of
          cardiotoxicity, the remaining portion of the heart that
          had been snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of
          sacrifice was used to look for differences in expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antioxidant genes</ENAMEX> using quantitative RT PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>.
          The results of the RT PCR findings are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. Of the antioxidant enzyme mRNAs measured, the
          only mRNA that differed significantly due to diet was the
          inducible form of heme oxygenase, which is identical to
          heat shock protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>. A complete set of data was taken
          on each heart, which allowed calculation of the ratio of
          each antioxidant gene transcript to each of the other
          gene transcripts. The results of this ratio analysis
          reveal that the feeding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sE supplement</ENAMEX> caused the ratio
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MnSOD</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPX-1</ENAMEX> to significantly increase (see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Assay for chromosomal breakage or loss
          The presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more micronuclei in peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythrocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is an accepted marker of chromosomal
          breakage or loss that occurred prior to the extrusion of
          the nucleus during erythrocyte differentiation. Results
          of the scoring of the numbers of peripheral erythrocytes
          with and without a micronucleus are summarized in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5are</ENAMEX> data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with a
          series of injections of doxorubicin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doxorubicin</ENAMEX> (DOX) is
          a cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> with prooxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> known to
          cause genotoxic damage resulting in an increase in number
          of erythrocytes with a micronucleus. The results from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DOX</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> served as a positive control. Results of
          statistical analyses demonstrate a significant increase
          in erythrocytes with micronuclei due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment but
          no significant difference due to sE supplementation. Note
          that the highest mean incidence of micronuclei occurred
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sE supplement</ENAMEX> and treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Vitamin E was established as an essential micronutrient
        for proper fetal development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and the amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> required to maintain proper fetal development has
        been defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Units</ENAMEX>. In addition to its
        role in reproduction, vitamin E is known to be a
        lipid-soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antioxidant</ENAMEX> that blocks peroxidation of
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> in cellular membranes and is
        known to stabilize biological membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        Because vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> has multiple biological activities, it is
        best to report dosage in weight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The recommended
        dietary allowance and tolerable upper intake limit for sE,
        the commercially available form, has been calculated to be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 22 and 1470</NUMEX> mg per day respectively for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 kg</NUMEX> adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>, oral intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body
        weight per day was reported not to result in noticeable
        side effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Thus, we selected to use a dietary
        dose of sE at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 mg/kg</ENAMEX> body weight per day in
        tumor bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in an attempt to maximize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of
        lipid peroxidation in the cellular membranes of the tumor
        without an expectation of finding harmful side-effects.
        Specifically, this experiment was originally designed to
        test the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, a prooxidative cancer
        chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, inhibits tumor growth by increasing
        lipid peroxidation products in the tumor to cytostatic or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxic</ENAMEX> levels and that suppression of lipid peroxidation
        by sE would suppress the antitumor effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ]
        . The results demonstrated that sE supplementation did
        markedly suppress DOX-induced lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>, yet tumor
        growth was still suppressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sE</ENAMEX>. It was concluded that increased levels of lipid
        peroxidation products were not the sole cause of tumor
        growth inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>. As reported here (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the
        dietary supplementation with this high dose of sE, by
        itself, retarded tumor growth to a significant extent.
        It is not known how such a high intake of sE works to
        suppress tumor growth. What is known from the current study
        is that the sE supplement reduced lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and preferentially stabilized membrane polyunsaturated
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with more double bonds (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It has been
        proposed that vitamin E may incorporate into cellular
        membranes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the tocopherol side chain with
        the polyenoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid residues</ENAMEX> in the membrane fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19</NUMEX> ] . This interaction may stabilize cell
        membranes by making highly unsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> less
        liable to peroxidation as well as by making highly
        unsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> less available for phospholipid
        hydrolysis by phospholipase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . The latter action
        may reduce mobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arachidonic acid</ENAMEX> (AA) from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> and in this way reduce the amount of AA available
        as a substrate to cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase to
        produce eicosanoids with mitogenic and with inflammatory
        properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 20</NUMEX> ] . Other possible antitumor actions
        include: induction of apoptosis, interference with hormone
        production, modulation of cellular signaling and gene
        transcription, and induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 21 22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        In comparison to the inhibitory effect of vitamin E on
        mammary tumor growth (this report), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognault et al.</ENAMEX> report
        a stimulatory effect of vitamin E on mammary tumor growth.
        Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognault et al.</ENAMEX> report that when the diet was
        high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omega-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX>, tumor growth was significantly
        increased by vitamin E supplementation. However, when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> was relatively low in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omega-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX>, the promotional
        effect of vitamin E was not observed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . It is
        noteworthy that the diet used in the presently reported
        study was very low in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omega-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> and that this diet,
        combined with the high dietary level of sE, resulted in
        suppression of tumor growth. Thus, the different results
        may be attributable to the type and the amount of omega-3
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> (PUFAs) in the diet.
        Evidence for cardiotoxicity, as observed in this study,
        was not expected as supplementation with vitamin E at
        extremely high doses gave no significant indications of
        harmful side-effects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 25</NUMEX> ] .
        Perhaps vitamin E supplementation acts to inhibit lipid
        peroxidation but at the same time acts to down regulate
        other protective antioxidant systems as suggested by the
        antioxidant enzyme gene expression data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. If gene
        expression levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4reflect</ENAMEX> antioxidant enzyme
        activity, then an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> and decrease in GPX
        without an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> would result in accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inorganic</ENAMEX> and organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxides</ENAMEX> and hydroperoxides that can
        react with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to yield highly reactive free radical
        products that can damage cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as well
        as lipids. Likewise, the sE supplementation used caused low
        expression of the stress-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> of heme oxygenase,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HO-1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HO-1</ENAMEX> catalyzes the breakdown of prooxidant heme to
        biliverdin with release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon monoxide</ENAMEX> and iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion</ENAMEX>. It
        should be realized that these observations are suggestive
        of cardiotoxicity but are not definitive.
        Early studies suggested that vitamin E lessened the
        cardiotoxic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] whereas
        other studies indicate potentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinoyawa et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] suggest
        that vitamin E, when combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, may increase levels
        of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> in the heart and in the tumor while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] suggest that vitamin E may have prooxidant
        properties at high dosage levels.
        The micronuclei results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5suggest</ENAMEX> that while sE
        protects against lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>, it did not protect the
        genome of erythroblasts against the prooxidant effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> in this study. Thus, while the toxic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> was
        not significantly enhanced by vitamin E supplementation,
        neither was the toxic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> lessened by vitamin E
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The adage that more is better may not hold true for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> as there may be beneficial effects at certain
        levels but not at high levels. Clearly, more research is
        needed on the antitumor effects of sE but caution is
        advised that sE may also have side-effects in the
        heart.

          Histological analyses of heart and colon
          At sacrifice, the heart and colon were removed. The
          heart was crosscut through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ventricles 1/3</NUMEX> of the
          distance between the apex and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium</ENAMEX>, and then the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apex</ENAMEX> section was fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OmniFix II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mt. Vernon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) and
          then embedded, cut surface down, in molten paraffin. This
          provided a consistent histological section for estimates
          of myocyte vacuolization and toxicity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> Î<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">¼m</NUMEX> thick
          sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The
          number of myocytes with vacuoles in the subendocardial
          region of the left ventricle was counted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> sections
          of the descending colon were scores for number of cells
          in a crypt column from crypt base to mouth.
        
        
          Blood counts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac puncture</ENAMEX> at sacrifice
          and assayed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> of collection. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulter</ENAMEX> STKS
          hematology analyzer was used for counts of red blood
          cells, white blood cells, and platelets in EDTA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anticoagulated</ENAMEX> blood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Micronucleus assay
          At the time of necropsy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected by heart
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puncture</ENAMEX> using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml syringe fitted with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22G</NUMEX> needle.
          Immediately, small drops of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were placed on clean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopic</ENAMEX> slides. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was pushed behind another
          slide held at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45Â°</NUMEX> angle to form a thin smear over an
          area of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cm</ENAMEX>. All smears were air-dried for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-45</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> on the slides were fixed in absolute

          stored in a box kept in a dark place at room temperature
          or at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. The slides were stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange
          before microscopic evaluation.
          All slides were examined under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000Ã—</NUMEX> magnification
          using a fluorescent microscope fitted with appropriate
          filters for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">acridine</TIMEX> orange stain. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, the
          percentage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> erythrocytes with micronuclei was

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction and quantitative reverse
          transcription-polymerase chain reaction
          All heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were immediately frozen in liquid
          nitrogen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted by
          standard methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and analyzed by reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> followed by real-time quantitative
          polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the transcripts of
          interest. The methodology of quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> has been
          described in detail previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Specific
          quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> were designed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> sequences
          available in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBankâ„¢.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> and probes were designed
          from nonconserved sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (allowing for
          isoform specificity), spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> join
          (splice sites) when such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are known (preventing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the assay to any potential contaminating
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>). Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was made for all assays by the
          T7 polymerase method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>), using total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from the mouse heart. The correlation
          between the C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> (the number of polymerase chain
          reaction cycles required for the fluorescent signal to
          reach a detection threshold) and the amount of standard
          was linear over at least a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-log range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The level of transcripts for the
          constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> Î²-actin was quantitatively
          measured in each sample to control for sample-to-sample
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> concentration. Polymerase chain
          reaction data are reported as the number of
