        Fluid restriction and diuresis are frequently used in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the acute respiratory distress syndrome
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>), and a strategy of reduction in extravascular lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (EVLW) has been shown to reduce both ventilator and
        intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intrathoracic</ENAMEX> blood volume (ITBV) comprises the left and
        right heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> volumes and the pulmonary blood volume,
        and has been shown to be a better indicator of cardiac
        filling than the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> occlusion pressure (PAOP)
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITBV</ENAMEX> are measured using
        double-indicator dilution and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COLD Z-021</ENAMEX> system
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulsion Medical Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) which requires
        the insertion of a catheter into the femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> through
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> sheath. The technique also measures cardiac output
        by analysis of the femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> thermodilution curve.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> ischaemia, although rare, is a well known
        complication of arterial cannulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>] and this
        problem may be exacerbated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> who have
        microcirculatory disturbances including slowing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capillary</ENAMEX> blood flow and local arteriolar constriction [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>], and who also often require vasopressors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX>. A clinical concern exists, therefore, about
        the safety of femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery cannulation</ENAMEX> in the critically
        ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may potentially benefit from this
        sophisticated monitoring.
        Following insertion of the femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter,
        peripheral tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> is usually assessed by regular
        clinical examination of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colour</ENAMEX>, capillary return and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, all of which are subjective measures. The
        presence or absence of pedal pulses and measurement of
        maximum calf occlusion pressures assess only gross changes
        in large vessel flow. Single point laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doppler</ENAMEX> flowmetry
        has been employed successfully as a technique for measuring
        skin blood flow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>], but there are several methodological
        drawbacks associated with the technique. These include the
        potential influence of local perfusion by contact with
        traditional laser Doppler probes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], the small sampling
        area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> point measurements which, because of the
        spatial heterogeneity of the cutaneous microvasculature,
        might not be representative of overall flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>], and
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long time</TIMEX> needed to make multiple measurements.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanning</ENAMEX> laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Doppler flowmetry</ENAMEX> is a recent development
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] of the laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doppler</ENAMEX> technique that may overcome
        these drawbacks. A laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> is directed to scan over a
        predetermined area and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of individual measurements
        of perfusion are made. These data are stored electronically
        and converted into both greyscale photographic and
        colour-coded perfusion images. Subsequently, regions of
        interest can be outlined on these images and mean perfusion
        within them calculated.
        This new technique was used to assess the influence upon
        pedal cutaneous perfusion of the insertion of a femoral
        artery catheter for the purpose of measuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITBV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> and
        cardiac output (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pulsion COLD</ENAMEX> system.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        Following hospital ethical committee approval, and after
        obtaining informed consent, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a single
        intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> were studied. All were intubated,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilated</ENAMEX> and sedated and required cardiovascular support
        with vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Following the clinical decision to
        insert a femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to right or left leg catheterization. None had
        either historical nor current clinical evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peripheral arterial disease</ENAMEX>. Room temperature was kept
        constant at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> and both legs were uncovered for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min
        equilibrium period. All measurements were made immediately
        before and after insertion of the femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pulsiocath 2024 L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pulsion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h
        subsequently. All catheterizations were performed by a
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and involved a standard Seldinger
        technique and insertion of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> catheter through a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sheath</ENAMEX>.
        The mean systemic arterial blood pressure was measured
        using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-gauge cannula positioned within the radial
        artery. Calf occlusion pressure was measured using a hand
        held sonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doppler</ENAMEX> and a standard sphygmomanometer cuff,
        the maximum in either the dorsalis pedis or posterior
        tibial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> being recorded as the value. Vasoactive drug
        doses were recorded at the time of each measurement.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laser Doppler</ENAMEX> scans (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moor LDI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moor Instruments Ltd</ENAMEX>,
        Axminster, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>; approximate cost Â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">£30 000</NUMEX>) of the
        plantar aspect of both feet were made from a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cm</ENAMEX>. This distance was chosen as the closest from which a
        scan of the entire sole of the foot could always be
        included. In each case, the laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Doppler scanner</ENAMEX> was
        positioned to ensure that the laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> was perpendicular
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s feet. From each set of data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> images
        were simultaneously produced and stored electronically: a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">greyscale</ENAMEX> photographic image and a colour-coded perfusion
        map. On the photographic image, the sole of the foot was
        outlined, which equated to a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 17 000</NUMEX> individual
        perfusion measurements on the corresponding blood flow
        image, allowing calculation of mean perfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (PUs)
        for each foot for comparison with the other side. The
        results were analysed statistically using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-test.
      
      
        Results
        The laser Doppler scans were easy to make (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
        the computer software supplied with the scanner allowed
        simple measurement of mean perfusion within the outlined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foot</ENAMEX>. There were no complications associated with catheter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>.
        There were no significant changes in mean systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> blood pressure or maximal occlusion pressures
        between preinsertion and postinsertion measurements (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Furthermore, there were no significant changes in any
        of these parameters when they were measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catheterization</ENAMEX>.
        All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were receiving vasopressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> over
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (norepinephrine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.78</NUMEX> Î¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>; and epinephrine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX> Î¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per min). Dobutamine
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.6</NUMEX> Î¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per min) was also administered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. No alterations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' doses were made
        between arterial catheterization and the first
        post-catheterisation measurement. There was no significant
        change in any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> dosages 24 h following catheter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values for norepinephrine,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epinephrine</ENAMEX> and dobutamine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>,
        respectively).
        There was no significant reduction in foot cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perfusion</ENAMEX> measured with the laser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doppler scanner</ENAMEX> either
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the first two or</TIMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and final
        measurements following insertion of the catheters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Prior to catheter insertion, the mean difference in
        foot perfusion (insertion minus noninsertion legs) was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUs</ENAMEX>; following insertion this value was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUs</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.22</NUMEX>) and, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h, -2.9 PUs</TIMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ARDS</ENAMEX> describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathological syndrome</ENAMEX> characterized by
        an immunological reaction to various insults that results
        in diffuse alveolar damage. It is commonly associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and has a mortality of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-70%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> managed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diuresis</ENAMEX>/ fluid restriction and guided by
        the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> had significantly less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EVLW</ENAMEX> than
        those managed conventionally using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAOP</ENAMEX>; furthermore, a
        ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> was associated with a reduction
        in ventilator and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. However, fluid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> and septic shock can be difficult. Fluid
        restriction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock may exacerbate
        haemodynamic instability, increase inotropic requirement
        and lead to vital organ hypoperfusion. Thus, if this
        strategy is to be used, circulatory volume status and
        end-organ function must be carefully monitored.
        Following insertion of a femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter prior
        to the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITBV</ENAMEX> using double-indicator
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dilution</ENAMEX>, peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> has usually been assessed by
        regular clinical examination for capillary return, warmth,
        presence of pedal pulses and measurement of maximum calf
        occlusion pressures. More objective techniques of measuring
        cutaneous perfusion are available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], but these do not
        lend themselves to everyday clinical use. Conventional
        single-point laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doppler</ENAMEX> flowmetry (LDF) has been
        successfully used to assess the cutaneous microcirculation
        in a variety of clinical applications. Several studies have
        demonstrated the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDF</ENAMEX> to distinguish patients
        with established peripheral vascular disease from normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>], and it has been used to assess the
        viability of tissue flaps [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDF</ENAMEX> has also been
        useful in the measurement of cutaneous perfusion following
        percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] in patients
        with peripheral vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and following the
        administration of vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        Several comparative studies have validated LDF with
        other methods of measuring skin blood flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>], but
        the failure of the technique to gain widespread acceptance
        in clinical practice is secondary to the methodological
        drawbacks associated with it. Variation in the number of
        perfused capillaries and local differences in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasodilator</ENAMEX> response characteristics of vessels cause local
        differences in blood flow of up to sixfold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sampling</ENAMEX> area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX>-point laser Doppler probes is
        dependent upon their geometry, but is usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and</ENAMEX>, because of the spatial heterogeneity of tissue
        blood flow, single measurements may not be representative
        of overall local cutaneous blood flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. It has
        been suggested that calculation of the mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to six</NUMEX>
        measurements each taken over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s will reduce the error,
        but clearly this is time consuming [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Direct contact
        with the skin is necessary with traditional laser Doppler
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probes</ENAMEX>, and there are frequent difficulties in maintaining
        the same point of contact, making sequential measurements
        open to inaccuracy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] furthermore, pressure may
        influence local perfusion itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        The recent development of the scanning laser Doppler
        technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] allows the rapid measurement of flow
        over a large predetermined area and, by collecting
        reflected light via mirrors, the previously requisite probe
        and optic cables are dispensed with and there is no contact
        with the skin itself. The scanner is mounted on a portable
        stand and can be positioned to allow imaging around a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360Â°</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>). It is run by a portable notebook
        computer which allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> to predetermine the area
        in which flow is to be sampled. The laser is then scanned
        in a continuous rasta pattern over the tissue. A
        measurement is made <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 4 ms</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 65 500</NUMEX> individual
        measurements can be made in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5</NUMEX> min. The perfusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is transformed instantaneously into a greyscale
        photographic image and a corresponding colour perfusion
        image is generated, with different colours representing
        different levels of flow. The associated computer software
        allows either the whole image or smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of
        interest on either the colour or photographic images to be
        outlined and mean perfusion calculated within this
        area.
        The technique is noninvasive and, because of the
        multiple measurements made over a wide area, the error
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the spatial heterogeneity of cutaneous
        vessels when making sequential measurements from the same
        point is removed. The technique has been validated against
        flow models, conventional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX>-point laser Doppler
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowmetry</ENAMEX> and other established methods of assessing skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30, 31</TIMEX>], and has been used to measure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> in hepatic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and colonic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] tissue.
        Amongst cutaneous applications it has been successfully
        used to assess burn depth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], skin flap viability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>],
        the cutaneous response to inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] and the
        therapeutic response of psoriatic plaques to psoralen and
        long-wave ultraviolet-A radiation therapy (PUVA) treatment
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Other clinical applications of laser Doppler imaging
        to the measurement of cutaneous blood flow include the
        effects of postural changes in blood flow in venous leg
        ulcers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], the assessment of digital perfusion following
        arterial repair [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">perfusion overlying benign</ENAMEX> and
        malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and the effect of
        prostaglandins on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischaemic ulcers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
        Femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery catheterization</ENAMEX> has an associated limb
        threatening complication rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 1%</NUMEX> and can
        jeopardise peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Femoral arterial
        trauma with associated thrombosis and limb threatening
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischaemia</ENAMEX> following catheterization will be clinically
        obvious. Standard postcatheterization observations usually
        involve measurement of calf occlusion pressures and, in
        this study, these were not influenced by insertion of the
        catheter.
        More subtle changes in cutaneous flow may be more
        difficult to establish using clinical observation,
        particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are receiving vasoactive drugs
        secondary to their septic condition; this group of patients
        may be particularly at risk of critical peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischaemia</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, by their very nature, these
        techniques are wholly subjective. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanning</ENAMEX> laser Doppler
        flowmetry allows objective measurement of cutaneous blood
        flow and is able to detect changes in cutaneous perfusion
        that are not detected by the human eye. We were not able to
        demonstrate any significant alteration in pedal cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> either immediately following catheterization or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h later</TIMEX>. Despite the vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that the patients
        were receiving, the presence of the femoral catheter did
        not appear to reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> supply to the skin.
        Femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheterization for the purpose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">measuring ITBW</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVLW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> does not compromise peripheral
        cutaneous perfusion in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Scanning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laser Doppler</ENAMEX> flowmetry is easily used to assess cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> and provides an objective alternative
        to standard clinical evaluation of limb blood flow. It also
        has the potential to assess cutaneous perfusion following
        other interventions, either mechanical or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacological</ENAMEX>.
