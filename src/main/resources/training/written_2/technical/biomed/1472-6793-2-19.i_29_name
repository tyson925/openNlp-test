        Activity-dependent potentiation is the enhancement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractile</ENAMEX> response, which occurs as a consequence of
        prior activation. Staircase, the progressive increase in
        developed tension (DT) during low frequency stimulation,
        and posttetanic potentiation, the enhancement of twitch DT
        following tetanic stimulation are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common forms of
        activity-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . It is generally
        considered that the enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> during staircase and
        following a tetanic contraction occurs as a result of
        phosphorylation of the regulatory light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        It has been reported that there is a length-dependence
        of potentiation in skeletal muscle. Experiments conducted
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> have demonstrated that the magnitude of staircase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentiation</ENAMEX> is proportional to muscle length with a
        negative slope [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . This is the case, whether the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX> is conducted at the different lengths, or the
        poststaircase twitch contractions are evaluated at
        different lengths after staircase at a given length [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 10</NUMEX>
        ] . Length-dependence of posttetanic potentiation has been
        evaluated 
        in vitro at room temperature, and it
        has been reported that there is a length-dependence of
        potentiation, with the fractional enhancement of force
        being proportional to muscle length with a positive slope [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] .
        Considering these studies of length-dependence of
        potentiation, it would appear that the impact of muscle
        length on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> potentiation of a twitch is different
        between staircase and posttetanic potentiation. This would
        suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the
        mechanism of posttetanic potentiation relative to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, this difference in
        length-dependence could be a function of the different
        temperatures at which the experiments were conducted.
        In this study, the length-dependence of staircase and
        posttetanic twitch contraction amplitude was evaluated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle 
        in vitro , at room temperature with
        measurement of sarcomere length. In addition, staircase was
        assessed at a warmer temperature, to permit comparison with
        the responses previously done with staircase. The results
        indicate that there is a length-dependence of force
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulation</ENAMEX> in the twitch contraction for both staircase and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posttetanic</ENAMEX> response, and that in both cases the twitch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentiation</ENAMEX> is proportional to sarcomere length with a
        negative slope. Therefore there is no justification for
        ascribing a mechanism for posttetanic response that is any
        different from the mechanism for staircase.
      
      
        Results
        
          Sarcomere length measurements
          In many preparations, after obtaining a clear laser
          diffraction pattern at rest, the tracing was lost during
          the contractions. This was probably caused by
          translations of the muscle, which resulted in connective
          tissue, and/or adherent damaged fibers moving into the
          laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> preventing a consistent diffraction pattern.
          Due to this variability of sarcomere length during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contractions</ENAMEX>, all results presented herein are related to
          sarcomere length readings made prior to the contractions
          (passive sarcomere length), at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position along the
          length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>. Results of a given contraction were
          included only when the sarcomere length after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> was the same as it was in the beginning
          (i.e., the tracing was still clear and without apparent
          change).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>-sarcomere length relation of tetanic
          contractions
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-sarcomere length relation for tetanic
          contractions is presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The results
          obtained at the two temperatures used in this study
          depict virtually the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> =
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.86Â·SL - 0.39Â·SL 2</ENAMEX>(r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.55Â·SL - 0.20Â·SL 2</ENAMEX>(r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX>), for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> and 35Â°C
          respectively]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is plotted relative to the
          highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> obtained at any length in a given
          experiment. By extrapolating the results obtained on the
          descending limb of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-sarcomere length relation,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> appears to decrease to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.8 Î¼m - 3.9 Î¼m</NUMEX>, consistent with previous findings with
          intact [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] or skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EDL</ENAMEX> muscle of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.79 Î¼m and 3.93 Î¼m</NUMEX>, respectively). Similar to
          previous studies, the descending limb of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length
          relation shows a shift to the right when compared to the
          theoretical predictions based on the length of
          myofilaments, obtained from ter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keurs et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Activity-dependent potentiation
          Twitch amplitude was evaluated after each of the
          following: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Hz stimulation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> s at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35Â°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Hz
          stimulation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> s at room temperature, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for
          1.5 s at room temperature. In each case, the amplitude of
          the potentiated twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> expressed relative to a control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">twitch</ENAMEX> (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) was proportional to sarcomere
          length, with a negative slope.
          When stimulation was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> s, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35Â°C</TIMEX>, there
          was a staircase potentiation (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t > 1</ENAMEX>) which was evident at all
          sarcomere lengths studied (range = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> Î¼m - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> Î¼m).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Aillustrates</NUMEX> the length-tension relation for
          twitch contractions obtained at the start and end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Hz stimulation at each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different sarcomere
          lengths in a given muscle preparation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> features of
          the length-tension relation should be noted. The obvious
          point is that enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX>, whether expressed in
          absolute or relative (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) terms, is much greater at short
          sarcomere lengths than at long sarcomere lengths. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point is that the shape of the length-tension
          relation relative to sarcomere length has shifted, such
          that optimal length (peak of the length-tension relation)
          for potentiated contractions is less than optimal length
          for nonpotentiated contractions. This pattern is apparent
          as an increase in DT going from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.4 Î¼m to 3.1 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          prestaircase, as opposed to a decrease over this length
          range for poststaircase twitch contractions. The relative
          enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) at a variety of sarcomere lengths
          is presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, showing the strong
          length-dependence of the staircase response, with very
          little potentiation at long sarcomere lengths.
          Stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> s at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22Â°C</NUMEX> always resulted
          in potentiation at short sarcomere lengths, but
          potentiation was not always observed at long sarcomere
          lengths. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> experiment is shown in Figure
          3A. There is a shift to the left in the length at which
          the peak DT occurs after staircase. Figure 3Bpresents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> for staircase at a variety of
          sarcomere lengths in muscles at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX>. The magnitude of
          potentiation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> is less than the magnitude of
          potentiation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35Â°C</TIMEX>, but the length-dependence is still
          evident.
          Twitch contractions following tetanic contractions
          were potentiated only at short sarcomere lengths (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22Â°C</NUMEX>).
          At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer sarcomere</TIMEX> lengths, posttetanic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> was
          apparent, as the posttetanic twitch was smaller than the
          pretetanic twitch (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t < 1</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). In studying
          posttetanic potentiation, the length tension relation for
          twitch contractions was obtained with sequential
          contractions at different lengths, both prior to and
          after a tetanic contraction at optimal length. For this
          reason, the length-tension relation is more clearly
          defined in these experiments than in the staircase
          experiments, for which twitch contractions were obtained
          at a given length prior to and after repetitive
          stimulation at that sarcomere length. In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>, the
          length associated with maximal twitch amplitude is
          shifted to the left in the posttetanic contractions. In
          spite of the posttetanic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> which was evident in
          these experiments, there was a marked length-dependence
          of the posttetanic twitch amplitude (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ). The ratio of the posttetanic
          twitch to the pretetanic one decreased with increased SL
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation
          In order to discuss the results regarding the
          length-dependence of potentiation, we had to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> define
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation for the muscle preparation used
          in this study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation for tetanic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contractions</ENAMEX> had a descending limb, which was deviated to
          the right when compared to the theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length
          relation. It also showed an extended plateau where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> did not decrease until well beyond estimated
          optimal filament overlap. This extended plateau and
          deviation from the theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gordon et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] has been observed in other studies
          that used fixed-end contractions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . This
          augmented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> observed at a given sarcomere length is
          due either to inhomogeneity of sarcomere lengths or to a
          compliance within the muscle or measurement system.
          Forces that are higher than predicted could be
          explained if there is an inhomogeneity of sarcomere
          lengths during the contraction, as proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gordon et</ENAMEX>
          al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inhomogeneity</ENAMEX> has been shown to occur during
          tetanic contractions elicited on the descending limb of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] ., where some
          sarcomeres are being stretched while others are
          shortening. The sarcomeres that are shortening are likely
          situated near the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. In our study,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sarcomeres</ENAMEX> near the tendons may have been operating at a
          shorter sarcomere length during the contraction, when
          compared to the passive sarcomere length that we actually
          measured.
          Any compliance in the muscle or measuring system would
          also cause the sarcomere length during the contractions
          to be shorter than that before (or after) the
          contraction. Assuming all of the discrepancy between the
          theoretical and actual length tension relation is due to
          compliance, a correction factor can be generated. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1would</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> around the line representing
          the theoretical length-tension relationship if sarcomere
          length for each contraction was corrected by subtracting
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.19 Î¼m</NUMEX>. This correction could relate to a short range
          compliance that could be due to movement of the aluminum
          clips during each contraction.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relationship observed in this study
          is consistent with previous investigations on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>-length relation for fixed-end tetanic contractions
          of skeletal muscle. Therefore, our measurements of
          sarcomere length in the experiments on the
          length-dependence of potentiation are a reasonable
          expression of the actual (initial) sarcomere length for
          these conditions.
        
        
          Length-dependence of potentiation
          The observation that the magnitude of the posttetanic
          twitch response (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) was proportional to length but
          with a negative slope is in direct contrast with a
          previous report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . However, this observation is
          consistent with data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roszek et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , who
          reported enhanced low-frequency responses when these were
          preceded by tetanic stimulation in the medial rat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> muscle (at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37Â°C</NUMEX>). They observed that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhancement</ENAMEX> was greater at short muscle lengths. Our
          results provide evidence that the discrepancy between [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] and those of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] is not a function of
          temperature. Furthermore, it would appear that it is
          unnecessary to propose different mechanisms for
          posttetanic potentiation and staircase.
          There are other differences between the study by [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          ] and this one. They used a whole mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EDL</ENAMEX>, while we
          used a fiber bundle. While it is tempting to suggest that
          they may have had a central core of fatigued or damaged
          cells, it is not clear how this could account for the
          reversal of the relationship between length and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentiation</ENAMEX>. Another difference is the apparent length
          range which was studied. In the paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> &
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persechini</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , length is expressed relative to a
          reference length which appears to be the length at which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetanic</ENAMEX> developed tension is greatest. Contractile
          response was measured at this length, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25%</NUMEX>
          longer, at which length tetanic developed tension was
          apparently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 40%</NUMEX> of the peak value at the
          reference length. At this same length, twitch tension was
          just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 30%</NUMEX> of its respective peak value at the
          reference length. In contrast, in our experiments, the
          length range studied was from a sarcomere length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>
          Î¼m to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 Î¼m</NUMEX>. The relative length increase here is over
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. We would appear to be studying a greater range of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX>, but the range of twitch amplitudes is much less.
          In fact twitch amplitude at the longest length studied in
          this paper, has a developed tension that is not
          substantially different from that at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Î¼m</NUMEX>. The greatest
          twitch amplitude occurred at an intermediate length. Of
          interest, our tetanic developed tensions were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX>
          of the maximum at a sarcomere length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 Î¼m</NUMEX>. This
          difference in the length-dependence of tetanic and twitch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contractions</ENAMEX> has been reported previously and is
          attributed to length dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          .
          It is interesting that the twitch contraction after a
          brief tetanic contraction at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22Â°C</NUMEX> in our experiments
          demonstrated potentiation when the response was measured
          at short sarcomere lengths, and depression when the
          response was measured at long sarcomere lengths. This is
          consistent with the observation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krarup</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] that in
          the poststimulation period at room temperature, there are
          both factors which enhance subsequent contractile
          response and factors that diminish the contractile
          response. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krarup</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] reported that the dissipation of
          the depression of force was faster than the dissipation
          of enhancement, such that after a period of time, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhancement</ENAMEX> became evident. In the case of the
          posttetanic contractions reported here, the enhancement
          apparently predominated at a short length, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> was evident at long sarcomere length. This
          indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>(s) resulting in depression may
          have a mechanism that is length-dependent. It is also
          possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> may be similar at all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX>, and the potentiating effects may be the only
          factor that is length-dependent. It is important to point
          out that our posttetanic twitch contractions were
          obtained at a variety of lengths after a tetanic
          contraction at optimal length. The metabolic disturbance,
          or level of regulatory light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation would
          not have been different between these lengths.
          The depression of twitch amplitude after a tetanic
          contraction may be a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen ion</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inorganic phosphate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pi</ENAMEX>) accumulation. These factors are
          likely to be more evident after the tetanic contraction
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 pulses</NUMEX> per s) than after staircase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 pulses</NUMEX> per s).
          It is known that decreased pH or increased P 
          i results in a rightward shift in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>-pCa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+relation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . It has been shown for
          both pH and P 
          i that the shift is more evident at
          room temperature than at physiological temperature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . This factor may also explain why potentiation
          is less during staircase at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> than at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35Â°C</NUMEX> - in fact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gordon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] have shown an interdependence of
          changes in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensitivity associated with pH, and
          length.
          The mechanism for the length-dependence of
          potentiation may be related to length-dependence of
          activation, as suggested previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It was argued
          that the rightward shift in the control force-length
          relation during twitch (in comparison with tetanic)
          contractions is apparently due to enhanced sensitivity to
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as muscle length is increased [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 30</NUMEX> ] . Since
          regulatory light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> also results in
          increased sensitivity to Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , then it may be
          that there is a ceiling effect, and the two mechanisms
          are not simply <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>. Light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> may
          be less effective in enhancing the contractile response
          when it is already enhanced by length-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
          This interpretation relies on the assumption that the
          magnitude of light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation was similar
          after staircase elicited at different lengths. Myosin
          light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, the enzyme responsible for
          phosphorylating the regulatory light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, is activated
          by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+bound to calmodulin. A similar level of light
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain phosphorylation</ENAMEX> would be expected if Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients during this stimulation were not affected by
          length. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balnave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] have shown that Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+transients in mouse muscle are independent of length.
          Furthermore, a length-dependence of potentiation similar
          to that reported here has been reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> muscle
          after staircase at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , an approach
          similar to that used in this study for the posttetanic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentiation</ENAMEX>. It seems unlikely that the
          length-dependence of potentiation described here is due
          to length-dependent differences in regulatory light chain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>.
          The data available in this study cannot discern the
          possible mechanisms that are operating to result in a
          length-dependence of P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> . However, the observations in this
          paper clearly demonstrate that this length-dependence is
          operative at the sarcomere level, and P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> decreases as sarcomere length
          increases whether it is studied after high frequency
          (tetanic contraction) or after low frequency (staircase)
          stimulation. These observations are consistent with the
          proposed mechanism by which light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation
          enhances developed tension. It has been proposed that
          light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation causes individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> to swing out from the myosin back-bone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          ] , thereby bringing the actin binding site of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in close proximity to the actin filament.
          This would increase the probability of cross-bridge
          binding to actin, resulting in a greater number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> exerting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> during the twitch
          contraction. This mechanism is apparently ineffective
          when the myofilaments are in close proximity as would be
          the case at a long sarcomere length. There is no need to
          invoke a different explanation for posttetanic
          potentiation than for staircase.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Muscle preparation
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were deeply anaesthetized with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injection of pentobarbitol (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mgÂ·kg <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>).
          The right hindlimb was shaved and an incision was made
          along the surface of the hindlimb. The tibialis anterior
          muscle was removed to expose the extensor digitorum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">longus</ENAMEX> (EDL) muscle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EDL</ENAMEX> muscle was then transferred
          to a dissecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs Henseleit</ENAMEX>
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> mM; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> mM; NaH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.78</NUMEX> mM; MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM; CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> mM; NaHCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> mM; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dextrose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM) flowed.
          This solution was bubbled continuously with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pH</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, temperature = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22Â°C</NUMEX>).
          Experiments were performed with small fiber bundles
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6 to 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-12 mm long</NUMEX>) of the EDL
          muscle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was taken to clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> from
          connective tissue as much as possible. After dissection,
          the tendons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissected fibers</ENAMEX> were gripped with
          small pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>shaped aluminum foil as close to the
          ends of the fibers as possible. The bundle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> was
          then transferred to an experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, with
          continuous superfusion of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> as in the
          dissection chamber. One tendon clip was attached to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> transducer hook and the other to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> motor
          arm (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300B</ENAMEX>), allowing the fiber bundle to be
          suspended horizontally and adjusted to a specific
          sarcomere length, as desired during the experiment.
        
        
          Sarcomere length measurements
          The sarcomere length was measured by laser diffraction
          technique. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mW He-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ne</ENAMEX> laser (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 1125</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uniphase</ENAMEX>,
          Manteca, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>) with a beam diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> mm was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> through the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> perpendicular
          to the long axis of the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. The sarcomere
          length was established in a clear region of the bundle,
          close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> transducer. This region was chosen
          because in most experiments it was not possible to obtain
          a clear diffraction pattern in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the fiber
          due to adherent damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and/or connective
          tissue.
          The position and intensity distribution of the
          first-order diffraction pattern was monitored by a
          photodiode array which was scanned electronically every
          0.5 ms. The diffraction pattern was collected in a 10X
          objective lens (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.A.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>) and reflected through an
          access <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in the microscope. The transmitted laser
          light was projected via a telescopic lens and three
          cylindrical lenses onto a photodiode array (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RL-128A</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reticon Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>). An amplifier was
          used to produce an analog signal, the voltage of which
          was proportional to the sarcomere length, based on the
          median intensity profile of the first-order diffraction
          pattern [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The system was calibrated before every
          experiment with a test grating (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12.5 Î¼m</NUMEX>).
          Muscle bundles were adjusted to the desired length
          with the servo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> motor during experiments. Muscle
          tension and median sarcomere length were displayed on the
          computer screen during the experiments. Muscle force was
          measured with a semiconductor strain gauge transducer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENTRAN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intertechnology Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX>) connected to an
          amplifier in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bridge configuration. Stimulation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grass S88</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grass Instruments</ENAMEX>), was with supramaximal
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) square pulses, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ms duration, through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platinum</ENAMEX> wires in the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, parallel to
          the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>.
          Muscle bundles were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, one for
          the establishment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-length relation during
          sub-maximal and maximal stimulation, and the other for
          measurement of staircase and posttetanic potentiation.
          Muscles were first studied at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> and then at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35Â°C</TIMEX>. A
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-30 min equilibration</TIMEX> period was allowed at each
          temperature.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber bundles</ENAMEX>, tetanic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contractions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200 Hz</ENAMEX> stimulation rate; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-400 ms</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duration</ENAMEX>) were elicited at sarcomere lengths that were
          changed in steps of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼m to 0.4 Î¼m</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min rest
          between contractions. Sometimes during the course of the
          experiments, the muscle bundles were set at a reference
          sarcomere length where maximal force was obtained to
          verify absence of fatigue and/or damage in the
          preparation. In all cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> was not decreased
          when compared to previous contractions recorded at this
          same reference length, indicating that fatigue or damage
          did not occur in these experiments.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, each fiber bundle was
          used to assess either staircase (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> s) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posttetanic</ENAMEX> response (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> s). When staircase
          was induced, sarcomere length was set, and then the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> was applied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sarcomere lengths
          were tested in each preparation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min intervals between
          each period of repetitive stimulation). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) and last (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t *</ENAMEX>) contraction in each series were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collected</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> Hz analogue to digital conversion) for
          assessment of the effects of repetitive stimulation (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ). The sarcomere length was always
          the same after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s of stimulation as it had been
          prior to the stimulation. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 10 minute</TIMEX> intervals
          between stimulation, control twitch contractions were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elicited</ENAMEX> to verify absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> decline due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX> and/or fiber damage.
          To assess the length-dependence of posttetanic
          response, twitch contractions at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s intervals were
          obtained at a variety of sarcomere lengths both prior to
          (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) and following (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t *</ENAMEX>) a tetanic contraction which was
          elicited at optimal length (the length which gave the
          strongest tetanic contraction). The first twitch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> was obtained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s after the tetanic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX>, and the subsequent twitches were collected
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s intervals. These procedures follow closely what
          was done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore & Persechini</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , who have
          shown that at room temperature regulatory light chain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t */P</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> following a tetanic contraction
          return to baseline very slowly at room temperature.
