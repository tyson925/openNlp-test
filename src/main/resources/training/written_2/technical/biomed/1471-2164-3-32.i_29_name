        Recent progress in genomic sequencing has led to the
        rapid enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence databases</ENAMEX>.
        Computational biology strives to extract the maximum
        possible information from these sequences by classifying
        them according to their homologous relationships. Classical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protein families</ENAMEX> are distinguished by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> which exhibit
        sequence similarity, a feature which can often be used to
        infer that the sequences are related evolutionarily as well
        as functionally. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the first goals of any
        genome-sequencing project is to broadly classify as many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their products as possible into putative
        functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> are translated from their corresponding mRNAs.
        Cellular mRNA levels are immensely informative about cell
        state and the activity of genes, and in most cases, changes
        in mRNA abundance are positively correlated with changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein abundance</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> often reflects
        that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in similar biological
        processes and have related functions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore
        changes in the expression patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> families
        under different experimental conditions can provide clues
        about regulatory mechanisms, the relationships between
        broader cellular functions and biochemical pathways, as
        well as interactions between different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> motifs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        The advent of microarray technology has made
        simultaneous analysis of the gene expression profiles of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of genes a practical reality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Availability of human genome sequences and massive high
        throughput data on their expression provides an opportunity
        to study regulatory relationships between gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LifeExpress RNA Database</ENAMEX> is a gene
        expression database that contains raw and normalized data
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Incyte microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. Using these
        large-scale mRNA expression data, we can infer the
        functional relationships between protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> by
        comparing the aggregated expression profiles of the members
        of each protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> is a functionally annotated database of protein
        domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In this study, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of Pfam
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was mapped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> clones which were presented
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> microarray chips based on the sequence
        identity. We then generated mRNA expression profiles for
        these Pfam family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LifeExpress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LE</ENAMEX>) database (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 3.0</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX> release, Incyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics, Inc.</ENAMEX>). We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, whose
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are well represented on the Incyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. The expression data for various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">single Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in one experiment was first converted
        into binary digits and then summarized as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regulation Ratio</ENAMEX>. The set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Ratios</ENAMEX> for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particular Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> across multiple experiments is
        called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profile</ENAMEX>. By using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correlation</ENAMEX>, we analyzed the similarities between these
        Family Regulation Profiles to impute functional
        relationships between the different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. This method
        was validated by comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profiles</ENAMEX>
        generated based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LE</ENAMEX> data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subsets</ENAMEX>.
        This study explores an approach to relate protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> based on quantitative comparison of the family
        mRNA expression profiles. Analysis of the profiles may be
        useful to address what protein domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated and possibly how they may interact physically
        or genetically with one another.

          Clones mapped to multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          Structural similarities between distinct proteins
          often involve only a portion of each protein sequence.
          These conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-structures</ENAMEX>, which often have readily
          identifiable boundaries, may recur in a large number of
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in which they perform a similar
          function. In addition, many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> consist of
          combinations of these recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">substructures</ENAMEX> (domains)
          in which case the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function can be economically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> based on the presence of these domains. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> is
          a domain-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database. Multi-domain proteins
          can be classified into several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, which in
          turns means that several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> can share the same
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> discussed here, there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1647</TIMEX>
          clones mapped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">346</NUMEX> Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> sharing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> clone. Multi-domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are the major reason for this observation, i.e. 
          PF00043 and 
          PF02798 representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-domain</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>-transferease respectively. Non-uniformity of Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and clone mapping may also cause clone

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> cross-validation
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> independent sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profiles</ENAMEX>
          were constructed from the randomly selected,
          non-overlapping subsets of expression data <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1 and S2</TIMEX> (see
          Methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Separate Pearson Correlation Coefficients</ENAMEX>, PCC1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC2</ENAMEX>, were computed from these data subsets
          respectively. The correlation between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1 and PCC2</TIMEX> was
          determined by calculating an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrichment Factor</ENAMEX> (EF) that
          expresses the degree to which calculations based on one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> subset were corroborated by calculations based on
          the other data subset.
          First, we selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs from S1 by screening for
          pairs where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCC1</ENAMEX> is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC1</ENAMEX> and PCC2
          for a particular pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are positively
          correlated, an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC2</TIMEX> cutoff should result in a
          greater likelihood of PCC1 falling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above 0.5</NUMEX>, i.e. EF
          should increase. We calculated a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFs</ENAMEX> with the
          PCC2 cutoff increasing from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX> stayed around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          for low PCC2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0 to 0.2</NUMEX>), and gradually increased to as
          high <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 4.2</NUMEX> when PCC2 - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFs</ENAMEX> were also computed to compare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1 and PCC2</TIMEX> in the
          same cutoff range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 1</TIMEX>. An EF greater than 1
          indicates higher than background correlation between PCC1
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC2</TIMEX>. The representation ratio predicted to occur if
          there is no correlation between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1 and PCC2</TIMEX>, and the
          observed representation ratios were calculated as
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>. The discrepancy between them was
          evaluated by determining the statistical variable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square (χ</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and the corresponding p value. The
          higher the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> and the lower the p value, the less
          likely the observed degree of correlation occurred by
          chance, which implies that the observed relationship is
          biologically significant. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, both EF
          and χ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2analyses</TIMEX> showed strong correlation between PCC1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC2</ENAMEX> with the p value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00001</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient between all PCC1
          and PCC2 values was determined to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.76</NUMEX>, showing that
          PCC1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC2</ENAMEX> were well correlated. Our approach is
          validated by this consistency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> correlations
          derived from randomly selected LE expression experiments
          S1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Expression monitoring on a genome-wide scale was first
        successfully demonstrated in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 13 14</ENAMEX> ] .
        Whole-genome expression profiles provide a rich source of
        information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene pathways</ENAMEX>, and have been compared
        with data sets describing transcription factor binding
        sites, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein abundance</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] mainly in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">budding yeast</ENAMEX>. In this study we used large scale human
        genome-wide expression data to study the relationship
        between the expression patterns of different protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. We summarized the change in gene expression level
        for a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as a binary code of
        "regulated" and "unregulated". A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold change in
        expression level was chosen as a cutoff for categorizing a
        change in expression level as significant. This cutoff is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arbitrary</ENAMEX>, but from our experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taqman</ENAMEX> confirmation
        (data not shown), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold change in expression level
        reliably distinguishes real signals from background noise
        for most expression experiments. The gene regulation was
        then converted to a percentage for gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to profile
        the regulation for each microarray experiment.
        Since the mapping from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to Incyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> clones is through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissprot</ENAMEX> database, Pfam
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that are not represented in the Swissprot
        database cannot be mapped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> clones, and are
        therefore not included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profile</ENAMEX>
        analysis. That may be one source of false negatives. Other
        factors such as sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> microarray
        technology, the arbitrary twofold cutoff, etc. may also
        contribute to false negative results. In order to reduce
        these types of errors, we included in our analysis only
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> clones.
        Due to the fact that the domain hierarchy of Pfam
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> is not perfectly reflected in the database,
        multi-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may fall into several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> members
        leading to a significant number of false positives. To
        address this potential source of error, we excluded from
        pair-wise correlation analysis those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> clones shared
        by both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.
        To validate relationships that are revealed by
        microarray expression profiling, one direct way is to split
        all the experiments randomly into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-overlapping pools
        and derive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> relationships independently from each
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">555 LE</ENAMEX> experiment were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1 and S2</TIMEX> and the corresponding Pfam
        relationships were denoted as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1 and PCC2</TIMEX>. The
        correlation coefficient for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1 and PCC2</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX> indicates
        a high degree of correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sets. In
        order to ensure the independence of the data, we also
        performed another analysis where data were split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        sets based on the tissue type. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> relationships (not
        shown) derived from these latter data sets are consistent
        with each other and with those derived from the complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> pool, further corroborating the observed
        relationships.
        It is important to note that many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family
        relationships (based on co-expression) identified here are
        supported by functional links. Taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (GPCRs) as an example, after agonist action,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs activate G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and become phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptor kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This event
        promotes activation of effector enzymes and ion channels by
        the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gα GTP</ENAMEX>. This GPCR-mediated regulation of ion
        channels also depends on the coordination and parallel
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine kinase</ENAMEX> and protein tyrosine
        phosphatase activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> can also interact
        with the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PDZ domain-containing proteins</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . All of these relationships are reflected in our
        study by the strong correlation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 7</NUMEX> transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (rhodopsin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00001</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinases
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00069</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine phosphatases</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00102</NUMEX>), ion
        transport <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00520</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDZ</ENAMEX> domain proteins
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00595</NUMEX>).
        Our study revealed many intriguing links between protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. For example, the link between homeobox proteins
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00046</NUMEX>) and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        a very important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors. According
        to our analysis, homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in the
        regulation of or are regulated by many protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>, ion channels, tyrosine phosphatases, nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone receptors</ENAMEX>, and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinases</ENAMEX>. For example the
        cone rod <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homeobox</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crx</ENAMEX>) binds and transactivates the
        rhodopsin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . However, it has not been
        determined whether other rhodopsin GPCRs are also regulated
        by homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , it was reported that the
        homeobox gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lim-6</ENAMEX>, is required for distinct chemosensory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representations</ENAMEX> (ion sensing), which is related to ion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel/</ENAMEX>transportation mechanisms. Again, it has not been
        studied systematically whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeobox proteins</ENAMEX> are
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of ion channel/transporter. Another
        example of an intriguing relationship revealed in the
        present study is between the PH domain, the EGF domain and
        the immunoglobulin superfamily. Pleckstrin-homology (PH)
        domains are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> modules of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 120</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> found in a wide variety of signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ranging from yeasts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The EGF domain,
        which often occurs as multiple tandem repeats, is widely
        distributed among extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
        adhesion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-ligand interactions, extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">matrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of cell fate, and blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coagulation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Cell adhesion</ENAMEX> usually activates PI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase activity. Many PH domain proteins bind with high
        affinity to specific phosphoinositides such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P2</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P2</NUMEX> or PI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>-P3 which are generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI-3</ENAMEX> kinase
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . This relationship was reflected by the high
        correlation coefficient (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.79</NUMEX>) between the PH domain and
        the EGF domain seen in our analysis. Furthermore, another
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the immunoglobulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PF00047</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> immunoglobulins which are
        particularly important in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion cascade are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intercellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adhesion Molecule-1</ENAMEX> (ICAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD54</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1</ENAMEX> (VCAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression that we observed in our analysis for the
        EGF-like domains and immunoglobin superfamily suggested
        that they may cooperate with each other in the cell
        adhesion process. Links between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> like these
        suggest novel hypotheses about family interactions that may
        be further explored.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Integrating genome-wide expression information with
        protein functional classifications and genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is
        a huge challenge. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is based on the binary
        idealization of gene expression change to generate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regulation Profile</ENAMEX>. Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is simplified, the
        abstraction may be useful for conceptualizing the nature of
        functional relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>.

          Selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs in LifeExpress
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LE</ENAMEX> database contains data points from a total of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">976</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs (Note: here the term of "probe" refers to

          oneself to only those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs that have been run

          that belonged to these largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Processing</ENAMEX>
          One probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LE</ENAMEX> could have been hybridized to the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte Human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome</ENAMEX> chip several times. In these
          cases, the average of the differential expression values
          (fold difference) for the different hybridizations was
          used in subsequent calculations. For each gene, the
          expression ratio for a particular probe pair was reduced
          to a binary variable ("regulated" or "unregulated")
          rather than a continuous variable. For each pair of
          experimental conditions, a gene was considered to be
          "regulated" if it showed at least a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold change in
          expression level (either up- or down-regulated) between
          conditions, and "unregulated" if the expression ratio was
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold.
          In order to analyze the expression profile for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, we calculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Ratio</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRR</ENAMEX>) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as the percentage of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> which were "regulated" in a pair-wise comparison
          and assigned the ratio to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam ID</ENAMEX> for this probe
          pair. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> clones in the 
          PF00001 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had been hybridized
          with the probe pair of " 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC Cells, Untx</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dn4625</TIMEX> vs t/2
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hr ", of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) showed greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise comparison. This
          meant that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of 
          PF00001 were "regulated" with this
          probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Ratio</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> was
          assigned to 
          PF00001 for this probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.
          In order to reduce random noise, we only studied the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</NUMEX> clones on
          the microarrays. Family Regulation Profiles were
          generated for each of these largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pfam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> by
          calculating the FRRs corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">555</NUMEX> probe

          a and 
          b , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profiles</ENAMEX>
          of 
          a and 
          b would be modified with the clone
          excluded. In other words, common clones between Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> made no contribution to the PCC calculation.
        
        
          Cross-validation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          subsets
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to validate our approach is to verify that the
          Pfam relationships based on our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation</ENAMEX>
          Profiles would be ubiquitous. In other words, different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment sets, as long as the experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> is rich, diverse and well-represented enough,
          should generate a similar result. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">555 LE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs
          were randomly divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sets with one data
          set containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">278</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S1</NUMEX>) and the other one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">containing 277</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S2</NUMEX>). Based on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data
          sets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Regulation Profiles</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> were
          computed respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson Correlations</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Regulation Profiles PCC1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC2</ENAMEX> were calculated using
          S1 and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S2</NUMEX> respectively. PCC1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCC2</ENAMEX> should be
          positively correlated if the derived Pfam relationships
          are independent of the expression experiment
          selection.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Enrichment Factor</ENAMEX> (EF) is a parameter that
          represents the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs identified
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC1</TIMEX> within the cutoff range specified by 
          C1 are over-represented in pools of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs that could be identified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PCC2</TIMEX> within the
          cutoff range specified by 
          C2 . The number of total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs
          are indicated as 
          G 
          
            total 
           while the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs selected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC1</NUMEX> - 
          C1 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC2</NUMEX> - 
          C2 are indicated as 
          G 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          G 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> respectively. The number of Pfam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX> common to both PCC1 - 
          C1 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC2</NUMEX> - 
          C2 is indicated as 
          G 
          
            both 
           . Therefore the expected background representation
          ratio, or the random representation ratio for 
          G 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> within 
          G 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is,
          
          and the observed representation ratio for 
          G 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> within 
          G 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is,
          
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX> is then defined as,
          
          with a value for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">EF > 1</ENAMEX> indicating higher than
          background representation ratio for 
          G 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> within 
          G 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
          Take an example where 
          G 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is selected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC1</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2</ENAMEX> is
          selected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>. Out of total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8968</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs
          there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2185</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC1</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, so the ratio
          of R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> can be calculated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 2185/8968</NUMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> pairs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, of which
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> also have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PCC1</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. The ratio of 
          R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, therefore, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/0.24</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>
