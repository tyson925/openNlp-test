        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Familial</ENAMEX> and epidemiological studies have indicated that
        there is a strong genetic component in the aetiology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type I diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apolipoprotein E</ENAMEX> (apoE) was discovered as a plasma protein
        involved in the metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX>. Recently, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apolipoprotein E</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> ) gene has been suggested to be
        a risk factor for the development of micro- and
        macrovascular complications in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene is polymorphic. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> common alleles, 
        E2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E3</TIMEX>, and 
        E4, which code for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major
        isoforms, resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genotypes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">apoE2</ENAMEX> have higher triglyceride levels and
        are associated with lower cholesterol compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoE3</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoE4</ENAMEX> often have
        elevated plasma cholesterol levels. There is an increased
        prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> and particularly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apolipoprotein E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> may influence the
        metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Several
        recent studies have suggested that this polymorphism may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a genetic predisposition for diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Thus, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> is an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
        for the development of microvascular complications in Type
        I <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The aim of this study was to investigate the influence
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic nephropathy</ENAMEX> and retinopathy in Type
        I <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          In this study, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unrelated Type I diabetes</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for the
          case-control study were recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.Petersburg</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diabetological Centres</ENAMEX> and had participated in the
          program "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>" (which included monitoring of
          trends and examinations of the determinants of vascular
          complications in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type I diabetes</ENAMEX>) carried out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic patients</ENAMEX> included in this study satisfied
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mellitus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Glycated haemoglobin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HbAlc</ENAMEX>) was measured
          by ion exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chromatography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. At entry the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HbAlc</ENAMEX> levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.8%</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> I diabetes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> subjects
          with nephropathy and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without. The study
          covered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> Type I <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinopathy</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> type of diabetic complication, and
          consequently were analysed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type I diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, all the information was
          examined for evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nondiabetic renal disease</ENAMEX>. Then
          questionnaires, medical records, and measurements of
          albumin excretion were used to determine whether they had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were considered to
          have diabetic nephropathy if they were receiving
          treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX> and either suffered from
          persisting proteinuria, or had persisting high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">albuminuria</ENAMEX>. Urinary albumin excretion was measured by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephelometry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Nephropathy was defined as a
          persistent urinary albumin excretion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/min</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 mg/24 h</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urinalyses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with no history of nephropathy
          and no albumin excretion were considered free of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX>.
          Fundus ophthalmoscopy and angiofluorography were used
          to diagnose retinopathy. The diabetic retinopathy group
          consisted of those showing retinal change, while Type I
          diabetes control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were those who showed no signs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinopathy</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> genotyping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was collected from each individual and stored in
          ethylenediaminetetraacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (EDTA) tubes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was obtained from lysed white blood cells by
          phenol-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism was detected
          by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> genotyping was performed by
          the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hixson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernier</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] using a modified
          version described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skobeleva et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
          The sequence of the sense oligonucleotide primer was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AGATGCGGGCACGGCTGTTCAAGGA-3</ENAMEX>', and the antisense primer
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CCCTCGCGAGCCCCGGCCTGGTACAC-3</ENAMEX>' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> reaction contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM

          final volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX>. After denaturation step at 95Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cycle of denaturation at
          92Â°C (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min</ENAMEX>), annealing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min</ENAMEX>), extension at
          72Â°C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 min</NUMEX>) and a final extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min</ENAMEX>)
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MiniCycler</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ Research</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Watertown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          Genotypes were determined by 
          Hin6 1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fermentas, Vilnius</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>) digestion of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX>-base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> PCR-amplified
          fragment spanning the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polymorphic sites. The digested
          DNA fragments were separated using migration on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
          polyacrylamide gels and visualized under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">UV</ENAMEX> illumination
          after ethidium bromide staining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The codominant
          alleles 
          E2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E3</TIMEX>, and 
          E4 determine the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> genotypes.
        
        
          Statistical testing
          All data are presented as means Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> were
          compared using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test for comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
          for quantitative variables. Allele frequency among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case subjects</ENAMEX> were compared using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard Î§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2tests</ENAMEX>. The difference in genotype frequencies
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test. A
          value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered significant.
        
      
      
        Results
        Clinical characteristics by study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. No significant difference was seen between groups
        with vascular complications (nephropathy and retinopathy)
        and those without, no matter the age, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> duration,
        age at diabetes onset, and mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HbAlc</ENAMEX>.
        The frequency of each genotype in each group conformed
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy -Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium.
        The distribution of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> genotypes is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        There was no significant difference in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> genotype and allele frequency
        between nephropathic and normoalbuminuric diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In this study, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was found between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> retinopathy and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> polymorphisms. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> allele frequencies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were similar within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX> are the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most important microangiopathic complications in Type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Many of the environmental factors that
        influence the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular disease</ENAMEX> are known, but
        genetic components of the risk for diabetic microangiopathy
        are poorly understood. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes have been
        investigated to elucidate the genetic factors responsible
        for vascular complications. The most important of these are
        the aldose reductase gene ( 
        ALR2 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX>/deletion
        (I/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) polymorphism of the angiotensin I - converting enzyme
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX> ) gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>], C825T
        polymorphism of the gene encoding the beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> subunit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geterotrimeric G-proteins</ENAMEX> ( 
        GNB3 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22</TIMEX>], and C677T
        polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTHFR</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        The genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eto et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]
        suggested that lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abnormalities</ENAMEX> may contribute to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney disease</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy. The 
        E2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> frequency was significantly
        higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with nephropathy (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2%</NUMEX>)
        and with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.7%</NUMEX>) than in diabetic patients
        without nephropathy (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6%</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apolipoprotein E</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> is associated with the progression of diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX>. Presence of the apolipoprotein 
        E4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> is a protective factor, and
        other alleles entail risk factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        The genes responsible for genetic predisposition to
        vascular complications are still unknown, and little is
        known about the molecular basis of these complications. The
        influence of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism to the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic microangiopathy</ENAMEX> is uncertain.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chowdhury et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Araki et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] demonstrated
        an association between the presence of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> and diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type I diabetes</ENAMEX>,
        although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> do not support this association
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>].
        This study elucidated the role of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX> to diabetic vascular complications. No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism with diabetic
        nephropathy was demonstrated. This result for diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> confirms the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarnow et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onuma et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. It should be mentioned that sample
        sizes in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>] were larger than in this study. With
        increased sample size comes the possibility to demonstrate
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. But the larger the necessary and sufficient
        minimal sample size, the weaker the association
        demonstrated.
        We also analysed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism with diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinopathy</ENAMEX> in the present study. No significant
        differences were found between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with and without this
        vascular complication. A similar result has been shown by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarnow et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present study found no evidence for a role of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism in genetic
        susceptibility for the development of diabetic retinopathy
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type I diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APOE</ENAMEX> gene polymorphism and diabetic
        nephropathy may be weak or moderate, but not strong.
