        The incidence of cholestasis related to total parenteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> (TPN) among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preterm infants</ENAMEX> has been estimated to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 7% and 85%</NUMEX>, depending on the population examined
        and the definition of cholestasis used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In infants
        with necrotizing enterocolitis or short bowel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, the
        prevalence of TPN-related cholestasis is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60-90%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Although cholestasis is reversible in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after
        the successful advancement of enteral feeding, progressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver fibrosis</ENAMEX> and cirrhosis occur in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> even
        after complete enteral nutrition has been established [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Some studies have suggested that excessive amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
        hepatotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>, bacterial overgrowth, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">micronutrient deficiency</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPN</ENAMEX> contaminants all
        contribute to cholestatic liver injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        Diminished volume of enteral feeds may also independently
        contribute to the development of cholestasis. However, the
        mechanisms of liver injury in cholestatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> remain unclear.
        Recent studies have supported the hypothesis that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen intermediates</ENAMEX> (ROIs) and
        elevated lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydroperoxides</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> during
        cholestasis cause tissue injury. Exposure of isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> to hydrophobic bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> leads to
        intracellular production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> and lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxides</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Animal studies using models of surgically
        induced extrahepatic biliary obstruction have also shown
        that lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation products</ENAMEX> - specifically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malondialdehyde</ENAMEX> (MDA) - are increased in the cholestatic
        liver [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]. This increase is associated with decreased
        tissue antioxidant activity, increased leukocyte
        infiltration, and early evidence of collagen deposition;
        these effects are ameliorated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        exogenous antioxidants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Consistent with these
        findings, several forms of liver disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have
        been shown to be associated with oxidative tissue injury.
        Specifically, products of lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> are elevated
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatic hypoxia</ENAMEX>/reperfusion, obstructive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> disease, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alagille syndrome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and inflammatory liver diseases
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. 
        In vitro , procollagen gene
        expression increases in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> after exposure to
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxide breakdown products</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Furthermore,
        deposition of lipofuscin, a by-product of lipid
        peroxidation, characterizes TPN-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cholestasis</ENAMEX> in
        preterm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        The purpose of these studies was to determine whether
        TPN-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cholestasis</ENAMEX> in preterm newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased oxidative stress secondary to
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX>. We hypothesized that elevation in markers
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oxidative stress</ENAMEX> would be associated with increased
        liver injury, as measured by serum alanine transaminase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>) and aspartate transaminase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX>) levels. In order to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantify ROIs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, we measured urinary
        thiobarbituric-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-reacting substances</ENAMEX> (TBARS). The most
        abundant of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA</ENAMEX>, an aldehydic lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> product formed by the action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX> on lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>. The identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX> as potential markers
        of liver injury in cholestatic preterm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> may aid in
        the diagnosis and management of those at highest risk for
        ongoing liver impairment.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          All preterm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> (<<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation) born at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Peter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          and admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s neonatal intensive care
          unit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between March 1997 and December 1998</TIMEX> were serially
          screened during the course of hospitalization for entry
          into the 'cholestasis' study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Infants</ENAMEX> with
          major congenital anomalies (including all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> and liver anomalies) or with congenital
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired</ENAMEX> infection were excluded. The criteria for
          entry into the cholestasis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were direct bilirubin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>2 mg/dl</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34.2</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼mol/l</ENAMEX>) and duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TPN â‰¥</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>.
          If the infant met these criteria, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' informed
          consent for entry into the study was requested. During
          this period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> qualified for the cholestasis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, and informed consent was obtained from the parents
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>. When each eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> with cholestasis was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrolled</ENAMEX>, a preterm infant without cholestasis was
          matched for gestational age, birth weight, and severity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory illness</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' informed consent
          was requested to enroll, the infant as a control subject.
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> enrolled in the cholestasis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          matched controls were identified for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>. Parental consent
          could not be obtained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> constituted
          the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> obtained demographic
          and medical information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> medical records.
        
        
          Determination of urinary
          thiobarbituric-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-reacting substances
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Urine samples</ENAMEX> were obtained under sterile conditions
          from all enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> at the time of their entry into
          the study. Informed consent was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> for
          the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and these studies were
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee for the Protection of Human</ENAMEX>
          Subjects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Peter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> were measured as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>].
          Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼l</NUMEX> of urine was combined with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          butylated hydroxytoluene (in glacial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetic acid</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          l of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiobarbituric acid</ENAMEX> (TBA) solution.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were vortexed and were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, and the absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">532</NUMEX> nm was measured
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PerkinElmer Lamba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3B</ENAMEX> spectrophotometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PerkinElmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellesley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The quantity of TBARS
          is proportionate to the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA</ENAMEX>, a lipid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> product generated by the oxidation of
          membrane lipids by reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> species. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA</ENAMEX> reacts
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBA</ENAMEX> to form a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:2 MDA</TIMEX>-TBA adduct that absorbs at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">532</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>. In the present studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA</ENAMEX> was confirmed to be the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominant TBA</ENAMEX>-reacting adduct by high-performance
          liquid chromatography analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> samples.
          To control for urine concentration, data were normalized
          to urine creatinine concentrations, as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Determination of serum bilirubin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX>,
          alkaline phosphatase
          Blood specimens were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of the urine specimen. Quantitative determinations
          of serum bilirubin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX>, and alkaline phosphatase
          levels were performed by the clinical laboratory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St</ENAMEX>

          Statistical analysis
          Direct bilirubin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX>, alkaline phosphatase, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urinary TBARS</ENAMEX> values were not normally distributed. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are presented as median (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">25th</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">75th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">percentile</ENAMEX>).
          Differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were analyzed for
          significance by one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> using natural log
          transformations of the data, which are normally
          distributed. Differences were regarded as statistically
          significant at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.05</NUMEX>. Correlations of
          bilirubin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> were calculated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> using the log-transformed values to ensure
          normal distribution of all variables in those
          analyses.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.34</NUMEX>). At that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in
        the cholestasis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had been advancing on enteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feedings</ENAMEX> in addition to parenteral nutrition for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.3</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX>

        were not significantly correlated with gestational age,

        correlated with direct bilirubin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, top). In
        contrast, urinary TBARS levels among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were
        independently correlated with serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        lower).
      
      
        Discussion
        We found that elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver transaminases</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. These findings
        suggest that oxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> (as indicated by elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX>) is associated with hepatocellular injury in preterm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. Although there is ample evidence that oxidant
        stress follows cholestasis, our findings suggest that
        oxidative injury in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> may be induced by mechanisms
        that are independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholestasis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. For
        example, the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> may be linked
        to inflammation, which has emerged as a primary mechanism
        of liver injury after pathophysiological insults. Activated
        Kupffer cells and neutrophils release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX> and proteases in
        response to inflammatory cytokines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. ROIs
        in excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inactivate proteins</ENAMEX>, disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and oxidize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Preterm newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> may be particularly
        susceptible to such injury because they exhibit an
        imbalance between antioxidant- and oxidant-generating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. For example, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> exhibit decreased levels
        in the liver of superoxide dismutase, vitamin E, and
        Î²-carotene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antioxidant</ENAMEX> capacity in preterm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infants</ENAMEX> is also compromised by relative deficiencies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selenium</ENAMEX> and taurine, as well as reduced ability to
        synthesize sufficient glutathione [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
        Despite longer TPN <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and elevated serum
        transaminases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with cholestasis or elevated serum
        direct bilirubin did not display elevated urinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX>.
        Our findings are consistent with previous reports
        indicating an inconsistent relation between bilirubin
        levels and the degree of histologic liver injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
        This inconsistency suggests that cholestasis and hepatic
        impairment in preterm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPN</ENAMEX> are induced by
        mechanisms that are not dependent on oxidant-mediated
        hepatocellular injury. For example, lack of enteral feeding
        plays an important role in the development of cholestasis
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the neonatal period</TIMEX>, possibly mediated by direct
        hepatotoxic activity of bile salts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Bile salts are
        thought to exert adverse effects on signal transduction and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activate Fas</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. TPN-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholestasis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> also appears to be related directly
        to developmental immaturity of bile flow and production and
        to possible infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        TBARS measurements provide a measure of membrane lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> and, as such, may provide a direct assessment
        of the progression of liver injury at the cellular level.
        Although there was a statistically significant relationship
        between urinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver transaminases</ENAMEX>, a large
        degree of overlap existed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        the association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> levels and liver injury does
        not necessarily indicate causality. Despite physiologic
        evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROIs</ENAMEX> play a central role in tissue injury
        during inflammation, it is possible that elevated TBARS
        occur secondary to other mechanisms of hepatocellular
        injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Larger longitudinal and/or interventional
        (e.g. antioxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>) studies will be necessary
        to determine whether there is a causal relationship between
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> and TPN-induced liver disease in preterm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>.
