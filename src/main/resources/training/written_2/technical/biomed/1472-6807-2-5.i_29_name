        The proto-oncogene <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TEL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translocation, Ets, Leukemia</ENAMEX>) is
        a transcriptional repressor that contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal Ets
        family DNA binding domain; a central domain that together
        with co-repressors <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX> histone deacetylases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] ;
        and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> (sterile, alpha, motif) domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] , which we have recently shown forms a polymer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Chromosomal translocations in a variety of leukemias result
        in fusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TEL</ENAMEX> to tyrosine kinase
        domains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ]
        or to the transcriptional activators <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AML1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARNT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . In the tyrosine kinase fusions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerization</ENAMEX> leads to constitutive activation of the
        tyrosine kinase domains, which leads in turn to cell
        transformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Thus, compounds that block
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> polymerization could be effective in treating these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemias</ENAMEX>. To assess the feasibility of this approach it
        would be useful to have a structure of the polymer.
        The wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> polymer forms large insoluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, which precludes structure determination. We
        were, however, able to obtain a structure of a mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> polymer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V80E</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V80E</NUMEX> mutation is in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymer interface</ENAMEX> and reduces the affinity of
        subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> enough that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is relatively
        soluble above pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deprotonated</ENAMEX>. Sufficient affinity remains, however, that
        upon crystallization, the polymer reforms in the crystal.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V80E mutant TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> revealed a helical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-tail polymer in which the interface is made from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different surfaces on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. One binding surface,
        the mid-loop (ML) surface, consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> near the
        middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> surface, the end-helix
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EH</ENAMEX>) surface, is centered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal helix.
        Although the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V80E</NUMEX> mutant self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> weakly under the
        high pH conditions used for crystallization, we were able
        to show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native interface</ENAMEX> is quite strong. In
        particular, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a mutation in the EH surface
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V80E</NUMEX>) could bind with high affinity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nM) to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a mutation
        in the ML surface (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A61D</NUMEX>) to form a heterodimer with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native interface</ENAMEX>. In addition, the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> forms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, visible by electron microscopy, that have a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">width</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V80E</NUMEX> mutant polymer we observed in the
        crystal.
        While the wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V80E mutant SAM</ENAMEX> domains form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> that are grossly similar, we cannot be certain that
        the mutation does not significantly alter the interface.
        Even a small change in subunit orientation could result in
        substantial alteration of the structure of the polymer,
        when propagated over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many subunits</TIMEX>. We have therefore
        determined the structure of a heterodimer with a native
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Crystal structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> dimer
          We first attempted to grow crystals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">V80E/</ENAMEX>A61D
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterodimer</ENAMEX> characterized previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , but only
          obtained crystals of low quality. We therefore attempted
          to crystallize other variants and were able to obtain
          high quality crystals of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">V80R/A61D heterodimer.</ENAMEX> The
          protein complex crystallized in space group P1 with cell
          dimensions a= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52.8</NUMEX> b= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60.3</NUMEX> c= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62.3</NUMEX> α = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116.2</NUMEX> β = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98.9</NUMEX> γ=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98.7</NUMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimers in the asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. The
          structure was solved by molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> using AMORE
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and refined to an R 
          free = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.2</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> Å resolution.
          Details of the structure determination and refinement are
          given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I.</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> heterodimers in the
          crystal are essentially identical, with an average RMSD
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.68 Å</NUMEX> on all atoms. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> heterodimer is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, the interface of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dimers</ENAMEX> consists of an apolar core comprised of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Met57</TIMEX>,
          Ala61, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Leu64</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Leu65</ENAMEX> on the ML surface and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phe45</ENAMEX>,
          Leu47, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Val80 and Leu84</TIMEX> on the EH surface. The same
          residue positions make up the core of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V80E</NUMEX> mutant
          structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">V80E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-bridges
          surrounds the apolar core. The specific interactions in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-bridge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> are somewhat variable and differ
          slightly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">V80E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. In the structure of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native interface dimer</ENAMEX> reported here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> dimers in
          the asymmetric unit contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu44</TIMEX> to
          Lys60, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg73</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp79</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp69</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg71</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu68</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lys67</TIMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp69</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lys67</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu56</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Arg48</NUMEX> and
          Glu68 to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arg71</NUMEX> were found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> dimers. All these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> were also
          observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> molecules in
          the asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">V80E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, with the
          exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Glu68</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lys67</TIMEX>, which was surprisingly
          completely absent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">V80E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
          while the interfaces are grossly similar in all the
          structures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-bridging interactions are malleable,
          shifting to accommodate slight changes in the geometry of
          the subunits.
        
        
          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native polymer</ENAMEX> model
          Although it is not possible to obtain a
          high-resolution structure of the wild-type polymer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>, we can construct a model of the wild-type
          polymer by stringing together repeated copies of the
          heterodimer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. This assumes that the structural
          relationship between subunits is not very flexible. The
          rigidity of the interface is borne out by the fact that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimers in the asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the mutant V80E (see below) are so
          similar. The procedure for constructing a wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is shown schematically in figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>.
          Starting with a single subunit, additional subunits were
          added by aligning a subunit of the heterodimer to the
          last subunit of the existing polymer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. The new
          subunit was then added to the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. This
          procedure was used to construct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimers in the crystal asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
          The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> were essentially identical with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.87 Å</NUMEX> on backbone
          atoms. The architecture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the resulting polymer
          structures is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B.
        
        
          The wild-type polymer is similar to its mutant
          counterpart
          The wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">V80E mutant polymers</ENAMEX> are also very
          similar as shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> contain SAM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> arranged as a left-handed helix with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> screw symmetry. The repeat distance
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> is essentially identical, differing by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> angstrom (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 Å</NUMEX> for mutant and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 Å</NUMEX> for
          wild-type). These results confirm the architecture of the
          wild-type polymer proposed previously based on the V80E
          mutant structure.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM interface</ENAMEX> as possible drug target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domain oligomerization is the key event that
          triggers a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemias</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and is therefore
          an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
          Compounds that inhibit SAM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> could be effective
          in preventing activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aberrant SAM</ENAMEX>/tyrosine
          kinase fusions and consequent cell transformation. Deep
          pockets on a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> surface make ideal sites for the
          binding of small molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> because the surface
          area available for binding can be maximized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the interacting surfaces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domain
          in the polymer. There are no obvious deep pockets for
          design of small molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        In this report we have extracted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> dimer from
        the wild-type polymer and present its crystal structure.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native interface</ENAMEX> was found to be similar to the
        previously solved mutant interface. We also constructed a
        model of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymer</ENAMEX> and found it to be similar to
        the previously proposed mutant polymer. Thus, the polymer
        architecture is sufficiently robust to withstand a mutation
        from a hydrophobic to a charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the center of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">subunit interface</ENAMEX>. We have recently determined the
        polymer structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domain from another protein
        involved in transcriptional repression, the polycomb group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein polyhomeotic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ph</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim et al.</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>]. The
        Ph-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> polymer is quite similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM</ENAMEX> polymer even
        though the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have an unrelated domain structure and
        show <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> sequence identity between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. Moreover, different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are involved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-subunit interactions. We therefore speculate that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">polymer</ENAMEX> architecture is conserved for an important role in
        transcriptional repression, possibly involving in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of a repressed chromatin structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . A
        rigid, well-defined polymer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may be important for
        organizing chromatin in this manner.
        From the structure, we found that the interacting
        surfaces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> domains are devoid of the deep pockets
        that are ideal for small molecule binding. Although it may
        still be possible to find small molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, these
        results are not encouraging. Perhaps a more effective
        strategy would be to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein inhibitors</ENAMEX>, such as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SAM</ENAMEX> domains described here, that can bind with
        high affinity and block polymerization. This strategy is
        currently being tested.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Protein expression, mutagenesis and
          purification
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickchange</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>) to generate
          site directed mutants, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V80R and A61D</TIMEX> from wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEL-SAM cloned</ENAMEX> into a modified pET3c vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          ] . The expressed protein sequence includes an MEKTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader sequence</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38-124</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEL</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and then a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal His tag. Recombinant V80R
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A61D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. Coli BL21</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>)
          pLysS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>), and purified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ni-NTA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HiTrap SP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>) affinity column chromatography
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX> precipitation as described
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kim et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Crystallization, data collection and
          refinement
          To generate the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dimer</ENAMEX>, equal amounts of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> dimer (both at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml) were mixed together prior
          to crystallization. Crystals were grown by the hanging
          drop method in which <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 μl</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml dimer solution
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> mM bis tris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propane</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, were
          mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 μl</NUMEX> of reservoir <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> PEG
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX>. Hexagonal rod-like
          crystals grew at room temperature over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-week</TIMEX> period.
          Crystals were cryo-protected with the reservoir solution
          enriched with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) glycerol before data collection
          under a liquid nitrogen stream. The data was processed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DENZO/SCALEPACK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The molecular replacement
          solution was found using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMORE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] with a previously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">solved TEL-SAM mutant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V80E</NUMEX>) dimer structure as the
          search model. The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] was used for model
          building and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] was used for refinement. Water
          molecules and sulfates were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> near the
