        The application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> for the diagnosis of acute
        ureteric colic has positively influenced the practice of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urology</ENAMEX> and uro-radiology. The technology allows the rapid
        and accurate determination of the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> in the
        urinary tract. Since the pioneering study on the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> in the evaluation of ureteric colic by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, a number of studies have shown the superiority
        of non-contrast enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultrasonography</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Its sensitivity and specificity is reported to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95% and 96 %</NUMEX> respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . An
        important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the
        patient [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denton</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] noted a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mSv
        versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UHCT</ENAMEX> performed for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal colic</ENAMEX>.
        Advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> includes rapid scan time, avoidance
        of contrast related hazards, cost effectiveness, high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accuracy</ENAMEX>, and its ability to suggest an alternative
        diagnosis for flank pain. This last characteristic of UHCT
        is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier
        in their course, which may be helpful in decreasing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> morbidity. In this study, we are presenting our
        initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional
        diseases on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UHCT</ENAMEX> performed for the evaluation of acute
        flank pain.
      
      
        Methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">radiologist</ENAMEX>'s reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> films and medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">233</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between July</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 and August 2001</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX> for suspected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX>/ureteral colic were reviewed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> were obtained
        on a Cti/pro single slice helical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT scanner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
        Electrical medical systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). The exposure
        factors setting were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KVp 130</NUMEX> and mAS <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-250</ENAMEX>. All scans
        were obtained from the upper border of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T12</ENAMEX> vertebral body
        to the lower border of symphysis pubis using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm
        collimation, without the use of oral or intravenous
        contrast material. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were placed in supine position
        with full urinary bladder at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX>.
        Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist
        needed a better description of suspected distal ureteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculi</ENAMEX>. Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities
        otherwise suspected were analyzed. All relevant
        radiological, biochemical, serological investigations as
        well as per-operative findings were also analyzed.
      
      
        Results
        From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 19, 2000 to August 15, 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">233</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> for the evaluation of acute flank pain. Ureteral
        calculi were identified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX> examinations (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>), findings
        of recent passage of calculi in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) and no calculus in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) scans. Thirty-two of the conservatively managed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were lost to follow up and therefore were not
        included. In the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, sensitivity and
        specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> in diagnosing calculi was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99% and 98%</NUMEX>
        respectively while +ve and -ve predictive value was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>) had
        alternative or additional <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (other than renal,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ureteric</ENAMEX> or bladder stone <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>) diagnosed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1describes</ENAMEX> in detail the alternative or additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71 %</NUMEX> of these cases, diagnosis was confirmed by the
        surgical procedure, biopsy and biochemical evaluation (in
        case of pancreatitis) as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        A wide variety of significant or potentially significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX> can be identified on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UHCT</ENAMEX> performed for suspected
        ureteral/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal colic</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Apart from its
        high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing stone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX>, which discriminates it
        from other modalities, is its ability to pick up other
        unsuspected significant clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Early diagnosis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> such as appendicitis, cholecystitis,
        pancreatitis, diverticulitis and leaking aortic aneurysm
        that require urgent and prompt treatment could affect the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> morbidity and mortality associated with such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. In a large series of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> UHCT for suspected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX>/ureteric colic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) with alternative or incidental diagnosis.
        Table 2shows some of the major series published to date
        on this subject.
        Among the major series published on the subject [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , the incidence of unsuspected clinical entities
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX>. The disease pattern is remarkably similar in
        most series (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In one report from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX>
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcella et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] noted an
        unusually high incidence of incidentally discovered renal
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. There is low incidence of diverticulitis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> and we have found no case of diverticulitis in
        our series by comparison to other series. It is important
        that in the absence of ureterolithiasis, particular care
        should be taken to rule out alternative diagnosis for flank
        pain.
        In our series, early diagnosis of pancreatitis,
        cholecystitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, pyelonephritis and
        appendicitis, initiated early treatment. The alternative
        diagnosis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> tumors in our series and similar trends
        in other series is interesting. It suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHCT</ENAMEX> may
        change the prognosis in many cases that would otherwise be
        diagnosed late.
      
      
        Conclusion
        A wide variety of significant alternative or additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX> can be reliably identified on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UHCT</ENAMEX> performed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suspected renal</ENAMEX>/ureteric colic. In the present series, such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> were diagnosed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of cases. Unlike most series
        from the West we did not note any case of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverticulitis</ENAMEX>.
