        There is growing interest in intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> for measuring the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and
        predicting outcome in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] has been routinely applied in intensive care
        units and emergency prehospital settings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> provides
        a good basis for assessing the depth of consciousness and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coma</ENAMEX>. This scale, together with other neurological
        assessments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>], should be administered as soon
        as possible in emergency situations, and may be repeated at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, especially when neurological function is
        fluctuating [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> was developed as a means for grading patients
        with traumatic brain injury and for predicting their
        chances of neurological recovery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinicians</ENAMEX> now use GCS as
        the only neurological predictor in many prognostic systems,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">APACHE III</ENAMEX>, Acute Physiology
        Score (APS) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Simplified Acure Physiology Score</ENAMEX> (SAPS) [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> is a descriptive scoring
        system that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> assessment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In theory,
        the prognostic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> and the descriptive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> scoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are more relevant to prediction of outcome in
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> assessment is
        included in these systems. On the basis of other parameters
        (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
        oxygenation, chronic health points, age points), the MEES
        (descriptive) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> (prognostic) systems should be
        better than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> at predicting outcomes.
        The purpose of the present study was to assess the value
        of scoring systems in predicting outcome in nontraumatic
        coma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and to evaluate the importance of mental
        status measurement in relation to outcome.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and methods
        This prospective study was undertaken over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year</TIMEX>
        period, and included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">286</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized
        for nontraumatic coma. The inclusion criteria were <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GCS ≤ 9,</ENAMEX>
        and specific medical diagnoses as follows: hypoxic or
        ischaemic injury; focal cerebral injury; general cerebral
        injury; metabolic or septic encephalopathy; and
        drug-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coma</ENAMEX> or toxic injury, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> overdose
        and coma persisting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after discontinuation of toxic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>.
        In the prehospital setting, postintervention values
        (before admission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>) for the MEES
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> scales were measured in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score was recorded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of admission to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        The sensitivity, specificity and predictive power of
        each cutoff point were calculated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-by-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> table
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIcrosoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APACHE</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youden</ENAMEX> index was also used to
        determine the best cutoff points (the higher the index, the
        better the prediction at the cutoff point) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Percentages of correct predictions of mortality were
        obtained at these same cutoff points. For each score, ROC
        curves were obtained [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. The ROC curve depicts the
        relation between true-positive results (number of predicted
        deaths among those who actually died) and false-positive
        results (number of predicted deaths among those who
        actually survived) for each score. The greater the area
        under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ROC</ENAMEX> curve, the better the scoring system. The ROC
        curve was calculated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Systat</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systat Inc</ENAMEX>,
        Evanstan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The outcome predictions data were
        analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNemar</ENAMEX>'s test. The compara-sions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves and the analyses of the
        differences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youden</ENAMEX> index were performed using the method
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNeil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
        statistically significant. Values are expressed as mean ±
        standard error.
      
      
        Results
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">286</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
        died in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died were older than
        those who survived (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66.8</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11.1 years</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46.1</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and a higher proportion
        were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> scales were
        better in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> than in those who died (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.8</NUMEX>
        ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.8</NUMEX> ± 2.8 [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.2 ± 2.5</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.1</NUMEX> ± 2.7 [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.2 ± 2.1</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1</NUMEX> ± 1.2 [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>]). The distributions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> scores are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypoxic</ENAMEX> or ischaemic injury was the cause of coma in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.7%</NUMEX>), metabolic or septic coma occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.7%</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">focal cerebral lesions</ENAMEX> occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6%</NUMEX>), generalized
        cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7%</NUMEX>), and drug-induced or
        toxic coma occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">101</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35.3%</NUMEX>). Mortality data are
        given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3provides</ENAMEX> data for sensitivity, specificity and
        correct predictions of outcome at the cutoff points that
        gave the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youden</ENAMEX> index. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> scores were also
        compared by drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves in order to avoid fixing
        arbitrary cutoff points (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). There were no
        statistically significant differences in the correct
        prediction of outcome, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youden</ENAMEX> index or area under the ROC
        curve among <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        mortality.
      
      
        Discussion
        Subjective evaluations of clinical status by individual
        clinicians may differ in terminology, and even in
        measurement of the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Hence, various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptive</ENAMEX> and prognostic evaluation scales (scoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>) have been developed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX>.
        Objective evaluation of clinical status would facilitate
        comparison of methods, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centres</ENAMEX> and studies
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14</ENAMEX>]. The need for such
        evaluation scales is particularly evident in coma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        and even more so in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with alterations in
        consciousness. The aim of research in this area is to
        obtain a reliable and sensitive scale.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, such research resulted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6</ENAMEX>].
        Since this scale was reported, numerous studies have
        examined its value in assessing clinical status and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>. Initially, the scale was used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], but later it became widely used in
        evaluating central nervous system <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and state of
        consciousness.
        With the development of emergency medicine, a need arose
        for evaluation scales that would provide rapid triage and
        objective status assessment. On the other hand, a
        prehospital evaluation scale would be optimal if (apart
        from being descriptive) it had a prognostic component, and
        would therefore be applicable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based observation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Among the various scales, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEES</ENAMEX> has
        attracted attention because of its applicability in trauma
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] concluded that, for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> has good predictive value
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> mortality in comparison with other evaluation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>. The latter scale has also attracted attention
        because of its simplicity.
        In view of the experience with these scales in traumatic
        coma, we conducted a comparative study in nontraumatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coma</ENAMEX>. The need for accurate prediction of mortality in
        non-traumatic coma by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> was identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. In their comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> with other
        neurological tests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] demonstrated that the GCS
        has good predictive value. A number of studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 20</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>] have emphasized the importance of
        aetiology, which, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX>, represents a good
        combination for better prediction of mortality. In our
        work, we have also observed the prognostic value of
        individual elements of the electrocardiogram in coma
        following cerebrovascu-lar accident and organophosphate
        poisoning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> score
        correlates with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have
        suffered a cerebrovascular accident; also, the former is
        simpler and has fewer parameters. It was concluded that GCS
        was, because of its simplicity and rapidity, a better scale
        than the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Simplified Acute Physiology Score</ENAMEX> for prediction
        of mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cerebroventricular accident.
        Kriger 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] identified a correlation
        between intracranial pressure, analyses of evoked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">potentials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> score, regardless of aetiology of coma.
        Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> also concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> is a good
        prognostication tool, as compared with other, more
        complicated methods.
        In the present study, coma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were grouped on the
        basis of aetiology, according to the method of Sacco 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. No statistically
        significant differences in accuracy of prognosis prediction
        were identified for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> scales assessed. For
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prehospital</ENAMEX> work, this finding is important because it
        shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> does not deviate significantly either from
        the MEES scale (which has more parameters) or from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> scale (which is measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> has
        important advantages over other scales, because it enables
        rapid evaluation of status and may direct necessary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, it is possible to observe
        continuously the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of consciousness, and to identify
        eventual improvement (indicating efficacy of therapy) or
        deterioration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> is widespread and clinicians are
        familiar with it. This scale therefore facilitates good
        'clinical communication' between prehospital work and
        further hospital procedures and treatments.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> values determined before hospitalization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> determined on the first
        day of hospitalization enabled us to compare descriptive
        and prognostic scales directly. We compared the prognostic
        value of postintervention prehospital values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE</ENAMEX> II. We found that the prehospital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GCS</ENAMEX> assessment was as good a predictor of mortality as was
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score, as measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. The GCS
        is well established, and its simple application before
        admission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and during hospital treatment
        facilitates continuous evaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s state
        and allows prognostic evaluation in non-traumatic coma.
