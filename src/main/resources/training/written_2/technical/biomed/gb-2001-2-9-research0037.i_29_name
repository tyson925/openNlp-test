        Access to automated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing technology has made
        possible the rapid generation and analysis of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> expressed in organisms via expressed sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tags</ENAMEX> (ESTs) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. This information has helped
        to identify those genes expressed in particular stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and in specialized tissues or organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7, 8,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Novel gene products and target leads for
        therapeutic intervention can also be gleaned rapidly from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 11</ENAMEX>]. A more detailed understanding of the
        molecular interactions between symbionts, whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenic</ENAMEX> or mutualistic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], is also possible with this
        approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>].
        For a sequence isolated from interacting symbionts,
        determining its cellular role (or roles) is complicated by
        not knowing which species expressed the sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. We
        refer to this challenge as 'the problem': given a sequence 
        x expressed in an interaction between
        species 
        A and 
        B , did 
        x originate from 
        A or 
        B ? Various solutions are readily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conceived</ENAMEX>, each with merits and faults. Here, we show that
        a comparative lexical analysis of word counts
        (specifically, hexamer frequencies), previously used to
        detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> contamination in sequencing projects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>],
        provides a powerful computational basis to infer a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>'s species of origin.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimentally</ENAMEX>, one can attempt to solve the problem by
        hybridizing a clone (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) to genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>) from
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and determining to which target the probe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizes</ENAMEX>. This approach can produce very reliable
        results. However, if a sequence is highly conserved in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> taxa, hybridization stringency conditions can influence
        the outcome considerably. For high<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-throughput EST</TIMEX> sequence
        analysis, source verification by hybridization is
        impractical in terms of time and reagents. As an
        alternative to 
        in vitro hybridization, several
        computational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> are possible.
        Were the genome sequence of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> completely
        determined, one could simply use sequence similarity
        searching [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. However, most plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and
        their microbial symbionts have little or no genomic
        sequence data available, which makes this approach very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unreliable</ENAMEX>. Strong similarity to a sequence from one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> does not preclude the possibility that a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is present in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Conclusions based
        upon such partial knowledge have been informative, but are
        potentially misleading [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 23</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage varies across taxa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. Exploiting
        this fact may seem a viable solution to the problem, as it
        has proven suitable for predicting the presence of introns
        among exons in genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. However, it really is not
        practical, because of the need to know the reading frame
        for translation of a messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are of notoriously unreliable quality, sometimes
        having a large proportion of ambiguous bases, and sometimes
        having single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>-pair insertions or deletions, which
        disrupt a reading frame. Word counting is less prone to
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error, and uses information intrinsic to
        biases in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage by counting codon pairs as hexamers
        in a sliding window, whereas codons are read in
        non-overlapping, tiled windows.
        An intuitive approach to the problem that examines
        sequence composition is to compare the guanine and cytosine
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>) base content of a sequence with other sequences from
        the species being studied. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>' genomes have
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, this method can be very useful. In a
        recent investigation, for instance, sequences from the
        stramenopile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> pathogen 
        Phytophthora sojae and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybean</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycine max</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
        difference in mean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The origin of a number
        of sequences could readily be identified this way, but a
        large proportion could not, because of considerable overlap
        in the distributions' tails. Counting frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> is
        simple word counting, where the word size 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> semi-words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>/C
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A</ENAMEX>/T are counted.
        An alternative approach to determining the origin of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is suggested by previous work on analysis of word
        counts, or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -tuple frequencies, which was
        intended as a means of evaluating a library for
        contamination when sequencing from a single model organism
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The word-counting method provides distinct
        advantages over other computational methods. Unlike
        sequence-similarity searching, it does not require that the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding</ENAMEX> content of both genomes be known for
        reasonable inferences to be made. Further, word counting is
        sensitive to biases in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content commonly
        observed when comparing taxa, but does not require
        knowledge of the reading frame for amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> translation.
        That is, the underlying differences between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that result in base composition or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage
        biases can also be detected by counting words. Unlike GC
        analysis, lexical analysis establishes a clear threshold
        above or below which we can infer the species of origin,
        and a confidence level for an inference can readily be
        assigned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunning</ENAMEX>'s likelihood-ratio test of word
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissimilarities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] also has the appealing property of
        being non-parametric, having no assumption of normality for
        the underlying frequency distribution, which makes it
        statistically powerful [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunning</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] demonstrated
        that unreliable results can be obtained from parametric
        tests, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Χ 2</ENAMEX>, particularly in such cases as lexical
        analysis.
        In the experiments detailed below, we first validate the
        word-counting method on sequences whose origin and function
        are known, then compare it with ability to diagnose the
        origin of sequences with distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. We
        examine sequences from pathogenic interactions between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> from the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> hosts 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. max</ENAMEX> and 
        Medicago truncatula , then apply the
        word-counting approach to sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutualists</ENAMEX> in association with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. truncatula</ENAMEX> , the arbuscular
        mycorrhizal zygomycete 
        Glomus versiforme , and the
        nitrogen-fixing bacterium 
        Sinorhizobium meliloti .
      
      
        Results
        Validation sequence accession numbers, gene names, and
        comparison results appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Incorrect inferences
        are underlined. The word-counting method was generally
        quite reliable when tested against sequences of known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, being wrong in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cases out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>; a phosphate
        transporter from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> versiforme and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
        in planta -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from 
        Phytophthora infestans were
        misidentified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. This indicates a failure
        rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> - all false negatives under the null hypothesis
        that a transcript originates from the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.
        Performance of the method was not influenced by whether the
        isolated source of a sequence was an mRNA or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecule,
        as indicated by the column labeled 'mRNA?'.
        Distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content are <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately normal</TIMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases studied, those of axenic 
        P. sojae cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For
        sequences from infected plant cultures, a bimodal
        distribution is apparent. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">927</NUMEX>
        infected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. max</ENAMEX> sequences contain less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>; most of these are likely to be plant transcripts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]. This is a considerably greater number than for axenic 
        P. sojae cultures, in which fewer
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of mycelia and zoospore isolates contain less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>.
        Several properties of cumulative distribution functions
        warrant comment, to help explain similar plots from word
        dissimilarity comparisons (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>). The median of a
        distribution occurs where the function reaches a cumulative
        probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. Medians from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> 
        P. sojae <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are similar,
        varying by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). Other moments of
        the distributions are readily apparent; the variance is
        inversely related to the slope at the median value of the
        function. A useful property of cumulative distribution
        functions is that any point on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> axis gives the integrated area
        (cumulative probability) under the curve. We use this
        property to establish experiment-wide false-positive and
        false-negative rates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). In this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.088</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">β</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>.
        Calibration curves from hexamer dissimilarity tests,
        shown in Figure 2bas solid black lines for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and dashed
        black lines for stramenopile training sequences are
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> normal. The medians differ considerably, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10% percent</NUMEX> overlap in the two distributions'
        tails about the neutral 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Superimposed are
        comparison curves from 
        P. sojae test sets (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), which
        parallel the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content curves in Figure 1bbut show
        slightly less variance. Axenic sequences are clearly more
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stramenopiles</ENAMEX> ( 
        B 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> ( 
        A 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) in hexamer composition, with all but
        a small percentage having positive 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> values. Plant-like sequences are as
        abundant in the mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> as detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 23%</NUMEX>. As expected, the two methods agree, having
        positively correlated values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ( 
        r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.852</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P < 10 -16,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,641</NUMEX>).
        Looking in more detail at the paired dissimilarity
        values (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), we can see which individual sequences
        are more or less like plant and pathogen. The magnitudes of
        dissimilarity are also apparent, with longer sequences
        having larger dissimilarity values. BLASTX similarity
        searches against the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> in nr, a
        non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>] revealed
        that none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-like mycelial transcripts
        significantly resemble known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ( 
        E > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>). Among the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> most
        plant-like transcripts from the infected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. max</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> had no
        significant matches, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> matched putative 
        Arabidopsis thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> matched known 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. max</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cytochrome</ENAMEX> P450
        (accession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF022460</TIMEX>, 
        E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -34</NUMEX>), methylglyoxalase
        (accession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P46417</TIMEX>, 
        E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -34</NUMEX>), and a ripening
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (accession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF127110</TIMEX>, 
        E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -71</NUMEX>). Thus, the majority of
        the most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-like transcripts in the infected soybean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> strongly resemble characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> sequences.
        Analysis results from all 
        P. sojae and mixed-culture
        transcripts are available as additional data files, grouped
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from which transcripts were sequenced.
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that calibration curves from comparing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and microbial symbiont training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> have good
        separation and minimal overlap (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of three
        cases, but not for training set 
        B 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , comprised of zygomycetes and
        chytridiomycetes, which overlaps considerably with plants
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). The associated error rates are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.126</NUMEX> and β
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.207</NUMEX>. When comparing between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the
        error rates are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.052</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">β</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.084</NUMEX>, much lower than
        when comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> ( 
        A 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicago</ENAMEX> ) with fungi ( 
        B 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , zygomycetes and chytridiomycetes).
        Error rates for comparing stramenopiles and 
        P. infestans ESTs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> are as
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(α = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.088</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">β</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>).
        Also shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4are</NUMEX> cumulative distributions from
        comparisons with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula and microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbionts</ENAMEX>. All resemble calibration curves from plant
        sequences, having similar medians and slightly less
        variance than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> calibration curves. Comparison
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> show that the great majority of test sequences are
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-like than otherwise, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> or less resembling
        microbial symbionts more closely than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. A greater
        proportion of microbial sequences is present in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> versiforme interaction library
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>) than in the 
        P. medicaginis -infected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, Figure
        4a). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>'s root-hair enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MtRHE</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>] had a greater proportion of putative microbial sequences
        present (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7% and 25%</NUMEX>) than any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> isolated
        from symbiont-associated cultures. The axenic and
        nodulating root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> had the smallest portion of
        putative microbial transcripts (< <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>), with
        the axenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> closely resembling nodulating root
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>. The method of preparing a library can affect the
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and non-plant sequences, as discussed
        below.
        Paired dissimilarity values in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5show</NUMEX> in greater
        detail which sequences are more or less like plant and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbiont</ENAMEX>. Sequences from an interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and pure
        plant root cultures appear together for comparison.
        Considerable variation in the degree of dissimilarity to
        both training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> is clear, largely due to variation in
        the length of sequences within test sets. Consistent with
        the cumulative distributions of 
        D(A) - 
        D(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, most sequences lie
        above the identity function, and resemble the plant host
        more closely than the microbial symbiont. Mycorrhizal test
        sequences are more difficult to differentiate than
        sequences from the rhizobacterial or pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>, as seen by the diminished variation about the
        identity function in mycorrhizal comparisons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>),
        contrasted with comparisons from pathogen-infected and
        nodulating root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5aand c</ENAMEX>, respectively).
        Analysis results from all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula and mixed-culture
        transcripts are available as additional data files, grouped
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from which transcripts were sequenced, and
        sorted from the least <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-like transcripts to the most
        plant-like.
      
      
        Discussion
        Clearly, the word-counting approach provides a reliable
        solution to the problem of source identification with known
        confidence, and has several significant advantages. The
        reliability of the method is best justified in terms of the
        favorable validation test results, and is further
        corroborated by agreement with an analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content.
        In test cases where the correct answer is known 
        a priori , results were correct
        within error rates expected from overlap in training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>.
        (Recall that α = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.088</NUMEX> for comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
        stramenopiles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.052</NUMEX> for comparisons between plants
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.) Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, the problem is clearly
        resolved by word counting with a threshold value of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and with statistical rigor,
        because false-positive and false-negative rates for a set
        of comparisons are readily computed from cumulative
        distributions of dissimilarity between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>.
        Optimal statistical power (minimal false-negative rate) is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ensured</ENAMEX> when using a likelihood-ratio test statistic, as
        demonstrated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson-Neyman Theorem</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Further,
        word counting need not be trained only for the species
        being compared. Rather, it is sufficient that the training
        set be related to, but not necessarily congeners of, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> from which sequences are being compared. Sequences
        from several species of the genus 
        Phytophthora were correctly
        distinguished from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and bacterial sequences, and three
        genes from 
        Agrobacterium tumefaciens were
        correctly identified as representing a bacterial
        sequence.
        However, several caveats warrant prudence. Transcribed
        sequences that do not encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but rather catalytic
        single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAs</ENAMEX> such as transfer and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNAs</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>], should be treated independently because they are more
        highly conserved across taxa than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger RNAs</ENAMEX>. Also,
        filtering or trimming of low-complexity repeat regions,
        such as poly(A) or poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) tracts, is helpful because
        comparison results can be influenced by the abundance of a
        single hexamer. Early in our investigations, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set
        of training sequences obtained from directionally cloned 
        P. infestans cDNAs produced results
        that were difficult to interpret. It eventually became
        clear that, as the 
        P. infestans sequences were all
        single-pass reads from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of a clone generated with
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> primer, few sequences complementary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of
        the mRNA sequence were present in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. This
        meant that the hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAAAA</ENAMEX> was common, but the hexamer
        TTTTTT scarce. Large amounts of the poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) hexamer would
        be expected when sequencing reverse complements of mRNAs
        obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' sequences generated with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> primer.
        Both poly(A) and poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) regions were present among plant
        training sequences. As a result, any sequence that
        contained a poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) tract tended to resemble the plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Further, because the error rates for an
        inference depend on the degree to which calibration curves
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX>, the best results are obtained where overlap is
        minimal. Despite these caveats, word counting presents a
        viable solution to the problem.
        The 
        P. sojae -infected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. max</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> provides a clear
        example of contrast in both hexamer composition and GC
        content, resulting in readily diagnosed origins. Not every
        case is this simple. For clear separation between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to appear, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> must differ in composition and a
        detectable proportion of transcripts from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> must
        be present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. To be detectable, the proportion
        of transcripts present from a particular species must be
        greater than the error rate obtained from calibration
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX>.
        Though these criteria are true for the infected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. max</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t < 0</ENAMEX> for <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">927</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcripts</ENAMEX>), they do not appear to be true for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> we analyzed (
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t < 0</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-99%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">890</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,017</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcripts</ENAMEX>). In the 
        P. medicaginis interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>,
        we might expect the same bimodal distribution as seen with 
        P. sojae . However, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        were prepared in different ways. The 
        P. sojae -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
        prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> after infection, using a susceptible
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> strain, so as to maximize the number of pathogen
        transcripts present in the host tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Further, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. max</ENAMEX> hypocotyl tissues were
        infected directly with a zoospore suspension. In contrast,
        the 
        P. medicaginis -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
        prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> after infection and individual plants
        varied in their degree of susceptibility (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Vance</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data). <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> were also inoculated in a
        different manner: ground mycelia were dissolved in sterile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and incubated, and the resulting inoculum was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pipetted</ENAMEX> onto the soil surface, rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
        These differences in how tissues were cultured prior to
        library preparation could have produced the disparate
        abundance of plant transcripts, though both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were
        prepared from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> tissues infected with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> .
        For mycorrhizal root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, we might explain the
        relative lack of symbiont sequences as resulting simply
        from a relative lack of transcripts in the host tissue.
        Most of the biomass in mycorrhizal roots is plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biomass</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>]. We might therefore expect that most of the transcripts
        therein originate from the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. Confounding this
        result, the error rates in this comparison are the greatest
        among all the comparisons we performed, most likely because
        the evolutionary distance between fungi (zygomycetes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chytridiomycetes</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is the least among comparisons
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Also, zygomycete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequences are rare
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, which resulted in a small training set for
        these fungi, and may have amplified any biases. The high
        false-negative rate probably led to a failure to detect
        some symbiont transcripts.
        In nodulating root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, we do not expect to
        observe an abundance of bacterial transcripts, because
        bacteria generally do not form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyadenylated mRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        As the protocols used to extract and purify mRNAs from
        tissue lysate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> cited in this study all
        relied on the presence of polyadenylation sites, we
        generally do not expect to find bacterial transcripts.
        The abundance of putative microbial symbiont transcripts
        among sequences from a pure plant root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is difficult
        to interpret. The predicted portion of microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> was greater in the axenic root-hair enriched
        library than in mixed cultures. Error rates were greatest
        for comparisons between training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and pooled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zygomycete</ENAMEX> and chytridiomycete sequences. Other than
        providing an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> confidence level, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> false-positive
        rate does not completely explain why <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15%</NUMEX> of root-hair
        enriched transcripts resemble fungal hexamer composition
        more closely than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and warrants further study.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> had been taken to avoid contaminating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> tissue
        cultures by culturing seedlings in covered plates. Because
        of concern that ethylene accumulation in covered plates
        could improperly stimulate nodulation-related gene
        expression, seedlings were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 SO</TIMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , an inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>' response
        to ethylene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Inhibition of the ethylene response could
        have resulted in synthesis of transcripts that are
        uncharacteristic of plant roots. Analysis of another axenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">root-</ENAMEX>hair enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, particularly one provided a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to identify potential contaminants, and not
        treated with an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene</ENAMEX> response, would be an
        informative test.
        These observations warrant further experimental
        scrutiny. The transcripts identified as most and least like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> or symbiont might also be studied in more detail as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate participants</ENAMEX> in symbiosis. Symbiotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, whether pathogenic or mutualistic, present
        novel challenges to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> who
        study them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Computational</ENAMEX> approaches, in concert with
        experimental verification, can help resolve these
        challenges.

          Training sequences
          
            Calibration
            To characterize hexamer frequencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> hosts
            and their microbial symbionts, we collected sets of
            training sequences from public databases and edited
            them for quality. Training sets were chosen to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of, but obtained independently from,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxa</ENAMEX> participating in symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for which
            a diagnosis of origin would be made. Because the
            species being compared are represented unevenly in
            public sequence databases, taxa were chosen so that
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> the same number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were analyzed in each
            training set, rather than simply to maximize the
            numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or sequences present.
            Training sets represent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequences
            from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> taxonomic groupings: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> ( 
            A 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicago</ENAMEX> and 
            Glycine spp.), either fungi ( 
            B 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , zygomycetes and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chytridiomycetes</ENAMEX>) or stramenopiles ( 
            B 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ), including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from 
            P. infestans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], and bacteria
            ( 
            B 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 ,</ENAMEX> 
            Rhizobium , 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinorhizobium</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradyrhizobium</ENAMEX> ). We performed
            pairwise comparisons with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different, taxon-specific
            training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> ( 
            A and 
            B ) to infer the origin of a
            transcript.
            Training sets were obtained by querying the GenBank
            database using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entrez</ENAMEX> retrieval tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>].
            A preliminary query by taxon name obtained all
            available nucleotide sequences from that taxon, then
            the Limits option excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX> (sequence-tagged
            sites), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSSs</ENAMEX> (genome survey sequences), working draft
            sequences, and patented sequences from the query set.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organellar</ENAMEX> (mitochondrial and chloroplast) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was also
            excluded via the Limits option. A query term to require
            that a sequence contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding region (CDS)
            was also added, which excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> and transfer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX>. The results consisted of all sequences
            that contain a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequence
            available for that taxon at the time of the query. This
            was done on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate occasions: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>. (Changing slightly the composition of
            training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> between those dates did not notably
            affect the experimental outcome.)
            Following a previously established protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>],
            we used a resampling procedure to evaluate the degree
            of overlap between distributions of hexamer composition
            obtained from comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>. In this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, we resampled each training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> times by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> partitioning into training (for hexamer counts)
            and test calculation pools. To control for any bias
            introduced by length variation, a program randomly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clipped 300</ENAMEX> nucleotide fragments for word counting. As
            a result, one random <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nucleotide fragment from each
            training sequence was present in the training set
            during a single resampling replicate; independent
            replicates contained different, randomly chosen
            training sequences and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nucleotide fragments. Values
            of the test statistic from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> resampled replicates were
            pooled for calibration purposes.
            As with the original protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], we pooled the
            resulting test statistic distributions, normalized them
            as cumulative distributions, and then evaluated them
            for overlap. We call the resulting comparisons
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'calibration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curves</ENAMEX>', as they are not used directly to
            make inferences, but rather indirectly, to evaluate the
            degree of separation in hexamer counts from different
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxa</ENAMEX>. Overlap of calibration curves should be minimal
            to yield the most statistically powerful results
            possible.
            Due to considerable overlap of calibration curves
            between taxonomically general, inclusive training sets
            (that is, all eudicots, all fungi and miscellaneous
            eukaryotes, and all eubacteria, data not shown), we
            opted to work with specific training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> that included
            only the most species-specific sequences available,
            while maintaining approximately equal sample sizes
            across taxa.
            The most challenging case was that of the arbuscular
            mycorrhizal fungi, for which very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
            sequences are available. To increase the amount of data
            in this training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> ( 
            B 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) without biasing sample sizes, we
            pooled sequences from all species in the zygomycetes
            with all available chytridiomycete coding sequences,
            and compared this training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> with a set from a single
            plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genus</ENAMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicago</ENAMEX> ( 
            A 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). We chose this option, rather
            than including an arbitrary subset of sequences from
            the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, because zygomycetes
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chytridiomycetes</ENAMEX> have diverged from their common
            ancestor less recently than the ascomycetes and
            basidiomycetes, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">18S ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. That is, the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes
            are more highly derived from the common fungal ancestor
            than zygomycetes and chytridiomycetes, which resemble

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> quality
            Starting with a full set of sequences, we filtered
            for high-quality sequences by trimming regions having
            extensive ambiguous bases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich) and poly(A) or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) regions. The test statistic can be sensitive to
            the abundance of a single word [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Thus, we trimmed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) and poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to minimize the cases in
            which a test sequence resembles one training set more
            closely than the other, simply by virtue of having an
            abundance of the hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAAAA</ENAMEX> or TTTTTT. Similarly,
            test results obtained from short or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich sequences
            can be difficult to interpret [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. We allowed no more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N per hexamer</ENAMEX> and trimmed poly(A) or poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)
            tracts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 13 nucleotides.</TIMEX> To accommodate for
            possible sequence chimeras, those sequences found to
            contain an internal poly(A) or poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) segment longer
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> nucleotides were partitioned into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX>, and the longer of the two fragments was used
            in analysis, provided its length was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 300</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>.
            After trimming, we screened all remaining sequences
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nt or longer for similarity to 
            Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> [
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. All BLAST searches used default parameters and
            low-complexity filtering with the programs DUST or SEG.
            The decision to exclude non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> from
            training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> was informed by the appearance of bimodal
            distributions of hexamer frequencies and a large degree
            of overlap between calibration curves (data not shown),
            likely a result of divergent evolutionary rates between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding</ENAMEX> and non-coding sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>].
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chloroplast</ENAMEX> and mitochondrial sequences were eliminated
            to avoid complications due to variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage
            between nuclear and organellar genomes.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2summarizes</ENAMEX> counts of sequences and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> before and after trimming
            and screening. All training sets obtained using the
            procedure described above are available as additional
            files.
          
          
            Validation
            To test the validity of word counting as a solution
            to the problem, we identified a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> gene
            sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. max</ENAMEX> ), oomycetes ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> ), zygomycetes ( 
            Glomus versiforme ), and bacteria
            ( 
            Sinorhizobium meliloti and 
            Agrobacterium tumefaciens ), for
            which the function and origin have been characterized
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>. We chose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to play a role in
            plant-microbe interactions, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are
            found across taxa. We withheld these sequences, and
            partial transcripts of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, from training
            sets prior to comparative lexical analysis, and
            calculated hexamer dissimilarities for each of the
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> training sets as described below.
          
        
        
          Test sequences
          To diagnose the species of origin for sequences
          expressed in symbiotic cultures, we collected sequences
          generated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">distinct EST</TIMEX> sequencing projects from the
          GenBank database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>]. Sequences from pathogenic
          interactions originated from cultures of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> from
          the genus 
          Phytophthora with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>,
          such as 
          P. sojae and soybean ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. max</ENAMEX> ) isolated from inoculated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypocotyls</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> after infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and 
          P. medicaginis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula isolated from
          infected roots <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> after infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Vance</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> expressed during mutualistic
          interactions were obtained from cultures with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula and mycorrhizal ( 
          Glomus versiforme ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.J. Harrison</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data) or rhizobacterial ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. meliloti ; K. VandenBosch</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data) endosymbionts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoculation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> expressed in pure, axenic cultures
          from 
          P. sojae mycelia and zoospores [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>] and from sterile, uninoculated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> truncatula roots [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] provided a
          basis for comparison in which no foreign transcripts were
          expected.
          To maximize the reliability of diagnostic comparisons,
          we screened test sequences for high quality as for
          training sequences, and for low similarity to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , chloroplast and
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> transcripts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> and transfer RNAs). Independent BLASTN
          comparisons identified sequences having very high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> ( 
          E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -100</NUMEX>) to vector sequences
          or moderately high similarity ( 
          E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -20</NUMEX>) to non-nuclear or
          non-coding sequences obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> so
          identified were withheld from analysis. A summary of test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. All test sequences obtained
          using the procedure described above are available as
          additional files.
        
        
          Base content
          We wrote a PERL program (countGC.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pl</ENAMEX>) that calculates
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> base content of a sequence as the portion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanine</ENAMEX> and cytosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> among all unambiguous
          (non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) nucleotides in a sequence. The hist method in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>,
          version 1.1.1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] aggregated continuous percentages
          into discrete histogram bins, using bin sizes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, with inclusive lower bin boundaries and
          exclusive upper bounds; the lm method tested for linear
          correlation of the dissimilarity test statistic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Comparative lexical analysis
          White 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] used a
          likelihood-ratio test to determine whether word
          frequencies from a particular sequence more closely
          resemble the frequency distribution of control data sets
          from the taxon being sequenced or a distantly related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outgroup</ENAMEX>. They computed a test statistic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>(A,B,x) for each sequence 
          x as the difference of
          log-likelihood ratio dissimilarity measures, 
          D ( 
          A , 
          x ) = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-2logλ</TIMEX>( 
          A , 
          x ), for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sets, a control
          set 
          A and an outgroup 
          B , such that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>(A,B,x) = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(A,x) - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(B,x) . A
          negative value for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> indicates that the sequence more
          closely resembles words from 
          A ; conversely, a positive value
          indicates a likely contaminant related to 
          B . (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dissimilarity</ENAMEX> is conceptually
          related to distance. However, dissimilarity does not
          measure distance because it does not possess the
          mathematical properties of a distance metric [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].)
          Unlike the calculation of calibration curves, in which
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-nucleotide subsequences are randomly resampled,
          hexamer dissimilarity is measured over the whole length
          of a test sequence when inferring a transcript's origin.
          Originally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> used the null hypothesis
          that no difference exists for dissimilarity measures
          between the two data sets, or that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>(A,B,x) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. White 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative
          hypotheses: that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t < 0</ENAMEX>, being more like 
          A , or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t > 0</ENAMEX>, like 
          B .
          Lexical analysis using pentamers or heptamers yields
          similar error rates and very highly correlated values for
          the test result (not shown). Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] reported the best
          results were obtained using hexamers, and because a word
          size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> nucleotides corresponds to the size of a
          dicodon, we chose to analyze hexamer frequencies. To use
          longer words requires more training data, because the
          number of possible words increases exponentially with
          increasing word size. Use of shorter words may be
          adequate for some applications and will be investigated
          in future work.
          Though we used <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>'s word-counting methods, we did
          make slight modifications. We simplified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> program
          (called hybridize) to compute individual dissimilarity
          values, rather than paired differences; a patch that
          details how to modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> program is available (see
          hyb2dis.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">txt</ENAMEX> in additional data files). More importantly,
          we amended the null hypothesis and interpreted
          calibration curves to test for statistically significant
          dissimilarity differences. Though the likelihood-ratio
          test statistic indicates the magnitude of similarity to 
          A or 
          B , we do not know what values for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> are significant with known
          confidence. When testing hypotheses, one can make two
          types of error: type I, or false positives, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX>,
          false negatives [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The false-positive rate is denoted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">α</ENAMEX> and false-negative rate β. We determine α and β from
          overlap in the calibration curves. Inferring error rates
          from calibration curves is justified because we know the
          correct answer and determine the error rate via
          resampling, as with bootstrap methods to infer error
          rates or confidence intervals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
          We are interested in knowing from which of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          organisms a sequence originated, and are reasonably
          confident that it came from either one or the other.
          Thus, we assume it came from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and test whether we have
          evidence to refute this assumption. The null hypothesis
          here is that sequence 
          x is from 
          A . Alternatively, it might be from
          
          B . Evaluating the calibration
          curve overlap at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> quantifies the associated
          error rates. The cumulative distribution function ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cdf</ENAMEX> ) of taxon 
          B specifies β where 
          cdf 
          B intersects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>; the 
          cdf from 
          A specifies α as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- 
          cdf 
          A (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>). We can thus resolve the problem
          with known confidence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> : 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t > 0</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX>. All other
          computations were performed as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. Software used for lexical analysis was obtained via
          anonymous ftp from the TIGR software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTP</ENAMEX> site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
