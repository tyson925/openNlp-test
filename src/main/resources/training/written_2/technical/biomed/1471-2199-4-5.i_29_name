        Double-strand (ds) breakage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chromosomal DNA</ENAMEX> is
        obviously a serious threat to cells because various
        activities of the chromosome - gene expression, replication
        and partition - depend on its integrity. However, recent
        experiments suggest that such chromosomal ds breakage may
        occur relatively frequently during "normal" growth in
        several organisms - in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and
        chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        In 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> , spontaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breakage</ENAMEX> and degradation of the chromosome associated with
        a replication fork were predicted from early genetic
        analysis and were detected under various conditions of
        altered replication (for review, see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ). DNA ds breaks
        play a key role in homologous recombination. From a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ds
        break, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme starts degrading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (</ENAMEX>for review, see
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ). When it encounters a specific sequence called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX>,
        it promotes its pairing with a homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Even in the
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme, 
        sbcA mutation confers other
        recombination pathway, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RecET</ENAMEX> pathway. The 
        recE gene product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rac</ENAMEX> prophage
        converts dsDNA ends into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' protruding single-stranded form
        and the 
        recT gene product promotes
        recombination by annealing them with a homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in
        its vicinity (for review, see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] ). This recombination
        may result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> progeny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (non-conservative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombination</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> progeny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> (conservative
        double-strand break repair) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In a 
        recBC sbcBC background, a ds end
        stimulates homologous recombination that results in only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> progeny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (non-conservative recombination) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Analysis of the stimulation of recombination by replication
        (for review, see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ) and analysis of altered
        chromosomal replication (for review, see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ) led to
        the proposal that a chromosomal ds break formed during
        replication fork arrest triggers homologous recombination,
        which would reconstitute a replication fork (for review,
        see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ).
        Game and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have developed a sensitive means
        of detecting chromosomal ds breakage using a circular
        chromosome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Under most conditions of pulsed-field
        gel electrophoresis, a circular yeast chromosome and
        circular bacterial chromosomes will not enter the gel, very
        likely because they are trapped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the
        network of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agarose</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 13 14</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> double-strand break
        transforms this circular form into a linear form, which can
        now move slowly in the gel [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . We used this procedure
        to detect double-strand breakage of a circular bacterial
        chromosome occurring spontaneously or after loss of a
        restriction-modification gene complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . We found
        increased chromosome breakage in 
        recBC -null and 
        recC1002 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> under both conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> used pulsed-field gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> to detect degraded chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> arising
        spontaneously in 
        recBC mutants and arising during
        replication fork arrest [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . RuvABC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which
        catalyze migration and cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holliday</ENAMEX> junctions, are
        responsible for the occurrence of the degraded DNAs
        following replication fork arrests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        In this work, we employed the pulsed-field gel
        electrophoresis procedure to measure large non-circular
        forms of the chromosome obtained from various
        recombination-defective mutants in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rec +,</ENAMEX> 
        recBC sbcA , and 
        recBC sbcBC genetic backgrounds.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of growth medium on the accumulation of
          large chromosomal fragments
          Large linear chromosomal fragments were measured by
          pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In our analysis,
          growing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli cells</ENAMEX> are harvested,
          embedded in an agarose plug, and lysed 
          in situ . The chromosomes in a plug
          are electrophoresed in varying electric fields. An
          example of such a gel is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partitioned</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> places in the gel - the well, the
          area just below the well (marked by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> to the right of
          the gel), and the lower area. Intact circular chromosomes
          stay in the well [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 14</ENAMEX> ] likely because they are trapped
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agarose resin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Large linear
          forms generated by a ds break in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> would escape
          from agarose trap and form broad bands beneath the well
          (marked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>). This area corresponds to unbranched
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> forms <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 2000</TIMEX> kb when compared with
          yeast chromosome markers. When the DNAs become smaller by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>, they will migrate further. These
          interpretations are based on a previous work with a yeast
          circular chromosome and on our analysis of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli chromosomal breakage</ENAMEX> after
          loss of restriction-modification genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 15 16</ENAMEX> ] . In
          this work, we focus on the second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> species - the huge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> forms in the area just below the well (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          marked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>).
          In the experiment shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a 
          rec +strain (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AB1157</TIMEX> background)
          grown in minimal medium (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M9</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) gave rise
          to some of these huge linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> in this area. There was
          less of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> species when the cells were grown in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> medium (LB) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>). In an isogenic 
          recB21 recC22 strain, the amount
          was larger than in 
          rec +.
          We do not know why the medium makes such a difference.
          It could reflect properties of the spontaneous DNA
          damages, the replication fork, the number of replication
          forks, the number of chromosomes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
          structure of the chromosomes, the repair machinery, or
          the availability of homologous chromosomes for repair.
          All of these features will influence the chromosome
          stability not only in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rec +</ENAMEX>, but also in mutants. This
          medium-dependence is in the opposite direction to what is
          simply expected from generation of a double-stranded
          chromosomal end by collapse of a replication fork with
          another, replication fork moving in the same direction [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] , because replication initiation should be more
          frequent in a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> than in a poor medium. Whatever
          the reason, we chose to use the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> in which the 
          rec +strain produce less linear
          forms, because the background is clear and may allow
          sensitive detection of their increase in a survey of
          various recombination-defective mutants.
        
        
          recand ruvmutations
          The accumulation of huge linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> was also seen in
          other 
          recBC null mutants in this AB1157
          genetic background ( 
          recB21 , 
          recC22 and 
          recC73 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>)) and in another,
          V66, genetic background ( 
          recC73 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>)), as observed
          earlier [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . A 
          recD mutant showed no accumulation.
          The other non-null 
          recBCD alleles examined ( 
          recC1001, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1002</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1003</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1004</TIMEX>,
          recC2145, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recB2154</TIMEX> , and 
          recB2155 ) did not accumulate the
          huge linears (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). We do not know why the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> allele, 
          recC73 , shows more accumulation in
          V66 background than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AB1157</TIMEX> background in a
          reproducible manner (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand 2B</ENAMEX>).
          The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> tested - 
          recA, recF, recG, recJ, recN, recO,
          recQ, recR, ruvAB , and 
          ruvC - did not accumulate huge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear DNAs</ENAMEX>. The 
          recF mutation partially suppressed
          the effect of the 
          recC73 mutation in accumulating the
          huge linear chromosomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
        
        
          recBC sbcAbackground
          In the 
          recBC sbcA strain, an 
          sbcA mutation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rac</ENAMEX> prophage
          expresses 
          recET <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which promotes
          homologous recombination at a ds end [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the huge linears was seen with 
          recA, recE, recT, recJ, recQ, recF,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recO</ENAMEX> and 
          recR <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Mutations
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Holliday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> - 
          recG, ruvAB and 
          ruvC - did not lead to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>. The accumulation by 
          recJ mutation was suppressed by a 
          recQ mutation (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).
        
        
          recBC sbcBCbackground
          In the 
          recBC sbcBC strain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme
          is inactive and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecFOR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RecQJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> promote
          recombination together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In the 
          recBC sbcBC background, 
          recA, recF, recJ, recQ and 
          recR mutants accumulated these huge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linears</ENAMEX> to varying extents (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). However, again
          the 
          ruvC mutation did not lead to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments
          These assays were carried out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than twice</NUMEX> for each
          strain, and the extent of accumulation of the linear
          forms was reproducible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the area just below
          the origin was also measured by densitometry to confirm
          the above results (data not shown).
          When the chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the agar plug was digested
          with a restriction enzyme ( 
          Xba I) before the pulsed-field gel
          electrophoresis, all the strains examined produced
          comparable amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This amount is much
          larger than the large linear forms. This indicates that
          the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">undegraded DNA</ENAMEX> associated with the
          cells is comparable for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We found that large, non-circular forms of the
        chromosome accumulate in varying amounts in various
        recombination-defective mutants of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> .
        Our operational definition of the non-circular forms is
        their presence in an area just below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> in our
        pulsed-field gel, as marked by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> in this area may not be limited to a
        simple linear form of varying lengths. If a chromosome
        carries multiple replication forks as usual at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> in rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> double-strand break may be necessary
        to form a non-circular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">branched species</ENAMEX>, which should be
        able to move through the gel. Finding out macroscopic forms
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> molecules would be a technical challenge
        (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , for example). We do not know why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> make
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad bands in this area (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4th</NUMEX> lane, for
        example), either. Depending on the electrophoresis
        condition, one narrow band, a pair of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bands or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very
        broad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was observed (data not shown).
        Abundance of these huge non-circular forms is expected
        to be affected by several factors, which might work
        potentially in opposite directions, such as: (i) breakage
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) degradation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) repair in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) breakage and degradation out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
        Each term is, in turn, affected by other factors such as
        chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, number of the replication forks,
        speed of the replication forks, abundance of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and so forth. Therefore, our finding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of more of the non-linear forms in a rich
        medium than in a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) does not
        immediately allow us to conclude that starving conditions
        induce a chromosomal double-strand breakage.
        Spontaneous DNA damages, repair and degradation are
        expected to be the key processes in interpreting our data.
        Spontaneous DNA damages may interfere with replication fork
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and produce chromosomal double-stranded breaks.
        This would lead to extensive exonucleolytic degradation.
        Complete repair at some of these steps would reconstitute a
        circular chromosome, which will stay in the well. On the
        other hand, further degradation of the huge, non-circular
        forms would result in shorter or no fragments, which will
        run faster in the gel. The presence of huge linear forms,
        therefore, probably indicates both the absence of complete
        repair and the absence of further degradation. The absence
        of the large linears could either mean the presence of
        complete repair or the presence of extensive degradation
        activity. Our control experiments demonstrated that
        restriction digestion of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> before the
        electrophoresis results in release of comparable amounts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> in all the strains examined (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        This result, at least, excludes the possibility that the
        absence of the large, non-circular chromosomes in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strains</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) reflects the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX> during the process or by extensive and general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclease</ENAMEX> action. Of course, we cannot exclude the
        possibility that the broken chromosomes specifically have
        suffered extensive degradation.
        In spite of these potential complexity and essential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambiguity</ENAMEX>, our measurements provided a unique clue to the
        action of recombination-associated enzymes in the
        chromosome metabolism. Indeed, some of our observations in
        the mutants can be readily related to the established
        properties of the affected enzyme.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation</ENAMEX> of the huge linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> in the 
        recBC null mutants can be interpreted
        from the known properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme in a
        straightforward way. These null mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> cannot
        degrade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from a ds break nor can they repair <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by
        recombination [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . We assume that they cannot repair the
        broken chromosomes to form intact circular chromosomes and
        that they cannot degrade them into smaller pieces. The 
        recD mutant does not show nuclease
        activity but is recombination-proficient and able to repair
        the broken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This explains why it does
        not accumulate the huge linear forms. The other non-null 
        recBCD mutants ( 
        recC1001, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1002</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1003</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recC1004</TIMEX>,
        recC2145, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recB2154</TIMEX> , and 
        recB2155 ) are all nuclease positive
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . They would be expected to degrade the huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linears</ENAMEX>. They retain some to nearly complete recombination
        proficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] , which may contribute to repair of
        the large linears into circles. The other
        recombination-defective mutants, in otherwise 
        rec +background, did not accumulate
        the huge linears probably because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was degraded by
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme or was not produced.
        Partial suppression of the accumulation of the huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linears</ENAMEX> in a 
        recBC null allele by a 
        recF mutation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) leads to
        several possible explanations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RecF</ENAMEX>-mediated
        homologous recombination may transform a circular
        chromosome, possibly with a spontaneous damage, into some
        type of non-circular forms. This is expected because
        RecF-mediated recombination is non-conservative in the
        sense that it generates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> progeny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecule from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parental DNA molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Alternatively, RecF
        function may somehow help generation of broken chromosomes
        or maintenance of break to load <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        In the 
        recBC sbcA and the 
        recBC sbcBC backgrounds, the absence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> nuclease may prevent faster degradation of the
        large non-circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX>. However, we see only little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the broken forms. One might expect that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the huge linears may correlate with the
        capacity for recombination repair that reconstitutes a
        circular form. Indeed, the effects of 
        recA, recJ and several other 
        rec mutations on accumulation of the
        huge linear chromosomes in these two 
        recBC backgrounds (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Cand 2D</ENAMEX>)
        were similar to their negative effects on conjugational
        recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] with interesting exceptions (see next
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paragraph</ENAMEX>). This accords with the concept that a huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> fragments of the chromosome is involved in
        recombination following conjugation. However, any of the
        recombination mutants that lead to accumulation of linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> could affect the probability of breaks occurring in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.
        The mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Holliday-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-processing enzymes -
        RecG, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RuvAB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RuvC</ENAMEX> - did not result in accumulation of
        the huge linears even in the 
        recBC -minus background. The complex
        intermediate forms accumulating in these mutants may be
        trapped in the agarose gel (see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] ). An alternative
        interpretation could be that these enzymes may be involved
        in generation of double-strand breaks as hypothesized by
        Seigneur 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        The accumulation by the 
        recJ mutation in the 
        recBC sbcA background is suppressed
        by a 
        recQ mutation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kusano et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] found that both sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damaging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of crossing-over with
        double-strand break repair in a 
        recBC sbcA recJ strain are suppressed
        by mutant 
        recQ alleles. Such suppressing
        relationship was interpreted to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecQ</ENAMEX> acts
        prior to or concurrently with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecJ</ENAMEX>. Pulsed-field gel
        electrophoresis analysis of chromosomes after ultraviolet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX> has revealed extensive chromosome degradation
        dependent on 
        uvrA incision enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . A
        report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecJ</ENAMEX> proteins process
        nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at replication forks blocked by ultraviolet
        irradiation prior to the resumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> (see
        also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ).
        The accumulation of the non-circular, broken chromosomes
        correlated with the growth rate or DNA damage response in
        most of the 
        recBC -minus background [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recB</ENAMEX> or 
        recC null mutation showed low
        viability even in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous DNA</ENAMEX> damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . A simple interpretation of these data is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecA</ENAMEX>,
        RecFOR, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecQJ</ENAMEX> functions (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecET</ENAMEX> functions for the 
        sbcA background) repair chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breakage</ENAMEX> and/or prevent generation of the breakage. The
        major contradiction observed here is the phenotype in 
        ruv mutants. The 
        ruv mutants in all the background did
        not show any accumulation of the broken chromosome. This
        may suggest that the possible role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ruv protein</ENAMEX> is making
        a break into dsDNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our sensitive measurements of the large non-circular
        forms of the chromosome - which should be able to detect
        one ds break out of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 million bp</NUMEX> - provided unique sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that would help in further elucidating the mechanisms
        of chromosome double-strand break repair. A simplest
        interpretation of our data is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecBCD</ENAMEX> enzyme is
        involved in repair and degradation of broken chromosomes,
        and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA, RecFOR, RecQJ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecET</ENAMEX> functions are
        involved in prevention and/or repair of the breakage.
        Interaction was observed between a 
        recC mutation and a 
        recF mutation and between a 
        recQ mutation and a 
        recJ mutation. 
        ruvABC mutants and a 
        recG mutant did not accumulate broken
        chromosomes. Further molecular analysis would bring about
        interpretation of the present data in detailed molecular
        terms.

          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> in agarose gel
          The cells were lysed in agarose gel by a modification
          of the method of Kusano 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Cells were grown

          of the culture was transferred to a micro-tube and mixed

          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 9.5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
          The sample plugs were placed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a running

          with molten <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> agarose. Pulsed-field gel
          electrophoresis was carried out in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia/LKB</ENAMEX>
          apparatus under the following conditions: electrophoresis
