        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> is predicted to be newly diagnosed in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 211,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> percent of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will be diagnosed with breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in their lifetime, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX> will die of the disease.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> transformation associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        requires the coordinated activation or inhibition of
        specific intact or altered genes. Transcription factors
        frequently regulate these processes. An important type of
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> contains a conserved region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> called the homeodomain (HD), encoded by a DNA
        region, the homeobox (HB). HD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of development and differentiation in many
        organisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Initially discovered in 
        Drosophila , mutations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB</ENAMEX> in
        homeobox genes result in vast morphologic abnormalities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . Subsequently, homologous HB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been cloned in
        many species including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vertebrate</ENAMEX> HB genes are divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes: Class
        I genes (HOX <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) are organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clusters (HOX
        A, B, C, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Class II</ENAMEX> are also called divergent genes, including genes
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRX</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLX</ENAMEX>, named after their homologs
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (paired, muscle segment,
        Iroquois, and distal-less, respectively) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Accumulating evidence suggests that homeobox genes are
        important in malignant transformation. Not only have
        altered expression levels of HB genes been detected in a
        variety of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malignancies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] , but the
        ectopic expression of certain HOX genes can induce tumors [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abnormal HOX</ENAMEX> gene expression has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. For example, the murine
        Hoxa-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene is upregulated in neoplastic murine mammary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glands</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the lack of HOXA5 expression
        results in the loss of p53 expression in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . Enforced HOXB7 expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SkBr3</NUMEX> breast cancer cells
        induces the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor
        and increases growth rate, serum-independent growth, and
        the ability of cells to form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in semisolid medium [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nude mice</ENAMEX>, when injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SkBr3/HOXB7</ENAMEX> cells,
        developed tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        We have cloned a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeobox cDNA</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX>,
        belonging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. BP1 is apparently involved in
        the regulation of diverse pathways. In normal erythroid
        cells it acts as a repressor of the β-globin gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ]
        . However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> was also expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of the adult and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> of the pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute myeloid leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we
        examined, and its overexpression increased the leukemogenic
        potential of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K562</NUMEX> cells 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Molecular analysis
        revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> expression is required for the survival
        of K562 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cells, suggesting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> might be part
        of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> pathway (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davenport GJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fu S, Haga SB</ENAMEX>,
        Do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, Stevenson H</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pinzone J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg PE</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data). Furthermore, these results imply that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aberrant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> expression might also be involved in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malignancies</ENAMEX>. In the present study we analyzed BP1
        expression in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines and assessed
        BP1 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma tumors,
        correlating its expression with age, tumor size, lymph node
        metastasis, histologic grade, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>)
        status, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>) status, and race.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell lines
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines Hs578T, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-468</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-47D</ENAMEX> were kindly given to us by Dr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela Brodie</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7ADR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435S</ENAMEX> were a gift from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Joseph Fontana</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF10A</ENAMEX> was purchased from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Cell lines were grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum,
          except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF10A</NUMEX> cells, which were grown as recommended
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Human breast tissues
          Human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were obtained from The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington University Department of Pathology</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX>, all with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approval,
          and as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Breast tissue
          samples, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> cm in diameter, were obtained from fresh
          surgical resection specimens from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, and were characterized pathologically in terms of
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> in malignancy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were snap-frozen
          in liquid nitrogen and were kept frozen until use. Normal
          breast tissues were obtained from the periphery of
          specimens surgically resected for treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or
          from an autopsy specimen obtained from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who had
          died of injuries sustained in an accident (not breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>); the latter was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation and reverse transcription polymerase
          chain reaction (RT-PCR)
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from human breast cell lines,
          frozen breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor tissues</ENAMEX> and normal breast tissues
          with Trizol reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          in accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 μg</ENAMEX>) was used to synthesize cDNA with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperScript II</ENAMEX>
          reverse transcriptase system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). After
          synthesis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed by
          initial denaturing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          cycles of denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, annealing at
          60°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, and extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> min. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX>, which span an intron, were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5'-GTATG-GCCACCTCCTGTCTT-3</ENAMEX>' (forward) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5'-GAGTA-GATGGTCCTCGGCTT-3</ENAMEX>' (reverse), giving a product
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs. The internal control for all samples
          was β-actin.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          Statistical analyses were used to determine the
          relationship between BP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positivity</ENAMEX>, measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>,
          and clinicopathological parameters. All 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values were calculated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact Test</ENAMEX>. Tests were considered significant if
          their associated 
          P value was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05 or less</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed). All statistical analyses were performed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          BP1 expression in breast cell lines
          BP1 mRNA levels were analyzed in a series of breast
          cell lines by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The cell lines are derived
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with the exception of
          MCF10A, which is an immortalized, non-transformed
          epithelial cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the
          levels of BP1 expression varied widely between the cell
          lines, from barely detectable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hs578T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435S</ENAMEX>, and
          MCF10A; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 6</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, respectively) to highly
          expressing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7ADR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-468</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-47D</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, respectively); <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 5</TIMEX>,
          respectively) showed intermediate expression. For
          comparison, one normal breast tissue from an autopsy was
          included in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>; it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-negative.
          There was a correlation between BP1 expression and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The cell lines that
          express little or no BP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hs578T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435S</ENAMEX>, and
          MCF10A) are not tumorigenic, whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7ADR</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-468</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231 express BP1</ENAMEX> and are tumorigenic. MCF7 and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-47D</ENAMEX> cells express variable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> levels and are
          tumorigenic only in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estradiol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
          BP1 expression might therefore be involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transgenic</ENAMEX> studies would provide
          direct evidence for this hypothesis.
        
        
          BP1 expression in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> tissues
          BP1 mRNA expression was examined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> invasive ductal
          breast tumors including grades <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>, and III tumors and,
          in some cases, compared with adjacent normal breast
          tissue. Of these tumors, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> expressed BP1. In contrast,
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> normal breast tumors analyzed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were
          BP1-negative and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> showed low BP1 expression. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">representative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> tumors, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> with
          matched normal tissue, is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. All of the
          tumors shown are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-negative. Matched
          normal and tumor tissues from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). No BP1 expression was seen in the normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> was expressed in
          all of the tumors (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional
          tumor tissues, shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 and 8</TIMEX>, were positive for
          BP1; matched samples were not available.
          To determine the significance of BP1 expression in the
          tumor tissues, clinicopathological data were related to
          BP1 expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). No significant relationship was
          detected between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX> status and age, tumor size, or lymph
          node metastasis. Because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> survival data were not
          available for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we were not able to evaluate
          survival outcome. BP1 expression was significantly more
          prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative tumors, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> were
          BP1-positive, compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-positive tumors, of which
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>). There was also a
          significant difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> expression between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-negative tumors, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-positive tumors, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). BP1 expression was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>: it was expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> of the
          tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> but in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 57%</NUMEX> of the
          tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>). There was no significant
          difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> expression between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumor
          grades: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BP1</NUMEX> was expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of grade I tumors, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>
          of grade II tumors and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of grade III tumors.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In the present study we found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of invasive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ductal</ENAMEX> breast tumors expressed BP1, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the DLX
        homeobox gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14%</NUMEX> of normal
        breast tissues expressed BP1. Our previous studies showed
        that BP1 is also expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> and has
        characteristics of an oncogene: in acute myeloid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>,
        BP1 is highly expressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> overall, with a preponderance of expression in
        pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . When overexpressed in a
        leukemia cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K562</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> increased the ability of
        cells to grow in soft agar, an indicator of leukemogenic
        potential, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 45-fold</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with a
        possible oncogenic role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> was the
        observation that its expression was correlated with the
        ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines to cause mammary tumors
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Recent studies have shown that abrogation of BP1
        expression in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cell line leads to apoptosis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davenport GJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fu S, Haga SB</ENAMEX>, Do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, Stevenson H</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pinzone J</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg PE</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Coupled with the
        increased clonogenicity resulting from overexpression of
        BP1, these observations suggest that the expression of BP1
        in breast tissue might also lead to increased survival and,
        conversely, that the abrogation of BP1 expression in
        malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> tissue could cause apoptosis of those
        cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrogen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>, which stimulate the growth of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast epithelium</ENAMEX>, are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crucial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> involved not
        only in normal breast development but also in
        carcinogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast epithelium</ENAMEX> and progression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 40%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative tumors are unresponsive to
        anti-estrogen therapy, probably because of constitutive
        growth factor expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . In general, these
        tumors have a higher histologic grade and a higher
        proliferative rate and are associated with poorer prognosis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The finding that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative tumors
        expressed BP1 might therefore be highly relevant to both
        the prognosis and therapy of those difficult-to-treat
        tumors.
        It is well known that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have a
        higher mortality rate from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> than Caucasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mancino</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ).
        Although socioeconomic factors account for some of this
        difference, several recent studies have shown that the
        median survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> presenting with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stage III</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> disease was significantly lower than that
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> diagnosed at the same stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>:
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stage III</ENAMEX> disease the median survival was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91.3 months</TIMEX>
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36.0 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, whereas in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> disease the median
        survival was reduced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24.0 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> patients
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.9 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> also have a higher risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative tumors after adjustment is made for stage and
        age at diagnosis. These results have led to speculation
        that there could be biological differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that contribute to the
        differences in outcome. Interestingly, more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>). It will be important to
        expand further the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> studied to determine
        whether BP1 expression might be one biological factor that
        underlies survival differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> and
        Caucasian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> was expressed in all tumor grades, we
        propose that it is activated in an early stage of malignant
        development or even in a premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. We have
        therefore begun to examine ductal carcinoma 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (DCIS), which are preinvasive
        malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> derived from epithelial cells, and
        fibroadenomas, which are non-malignant tumors composed of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> and stromal cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . So far we have
        analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX>, which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        fibroadenomas, both of which were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX>-positive, compared
        with no expression in the matched normal tissue for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroadenoma</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The sample number is very
        small, but the fact that any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCISs</ENAMEX> or fibroadenoma
        tumors are positive for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BP1</NUMEX> demonstrates that activation of
        BP1 might be an early event, perhaps promoting cell
        survival as seems to occur in leukemia cells. This idea is
        also supported by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> is as likely to be
        expressed in small tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 2.0 cm</NUMEX>) as it is in
        larger tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0 cm or more</NUMEX>).
        The mechanism for overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BP1</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        is unknown. However, because of its map location at
        17q21-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BP1</NUMEX> gene is a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA amplification</ENAMEX>, which could lead to its activation or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX>. This hypothesis is based on the fact that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17q</NUMEX> are sometimes amplified in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, one at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17q11</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> and another at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17q22</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . The locus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> is also near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX>; the
        implications of this proximity are not yet known.
        To begin to identify genes that might be targets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX>,
        we have overexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BP1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K562</NUMEX> cells and screened a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davenport GJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fu S, Haga SB</ENAMEX>, Do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, Stevenson H</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinzone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg PE</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Although
        K562 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>, among the genes
        showing altered regulation were several that are also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysregulated</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, including c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>; their altered
        expression was verified by real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. c- 
        myc was upregulated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K562</NUMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX>, and c-Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is highly expressed
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Cyclin
        D2, downregulated on the array, is repressed in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . It will be important to determine whether
        either of those genes is a target for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX> in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        These data strongly implicate BP1 in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. More
        case studies are underway to further strengthen our
        findings and to determine whether there is a statistical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between BP1</TIMEX> expression and prognosis or outcome
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        These data demonstrate a statistically significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between the expression of the transcription
        factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP1</TIMEX>, not previously implicated in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative breast tumors. This, together with other
        studies, strongly suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> has oncogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, making it a new potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, especially the difficult-to-treat <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-negative
        tumors. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BP1</ENAMEX> is expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, including all grades. This finding and the
        observation that fibroadenomas (non-malignant tumors) can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express BP1</ENAMEX> strongly suggest that its activation might be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with loss of growth regulation, which is
        consistent with our molecular data.
