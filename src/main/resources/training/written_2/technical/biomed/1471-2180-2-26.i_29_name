        Proliferation and dedifferentiation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX> is singularly unique compared to the
        effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infection in other non-lymphoid tissues.
        Indeed, unlike the atrophy and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-death of infected
        central nervous system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , cardiac [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , or
        gastro-intestinal [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parenchyma</ENAMEX>, aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle
        progression of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX> is a defining
        feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Yet, the mechanisms are largely unknown whereby HIV-1
        subverts the cell-cycle controls that normally maintain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelial</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . Nonetheless, several observations
        from 
        in vitro and 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX> pathogenesis
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> expression itself may be a key
        pathogenic factor. Infection of cultured podocytes with
        replication incompetent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> demonstrated that HIV-1 gene
        expression leads to the proliferation and dedifferentiation
        of the infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">podocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , recapitulating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenotypes</ENAMEX> observed in HIVAN specimens [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Similarly, renal expression of replication incompetent
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proviral</ENAMEX> transgenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> produces a
        proliferative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal lesion</ENAMEX> that is indistiguisable both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histopathologically</ENAMEX> and clinically from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIVAN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . These observations raise the possibility that
        HIV-1 gene products may interact with mitogenic pathways in
        infected renal epithelium to cause aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle
        engagement.
        In comparison to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general alternative mechanisms
        utilized by known transforming viruses to promote
        cell-cycle progression, namely, by activating or bypassing
        endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-type cyclins (herein, referred to as "cyclin
        D"), it has not been established whether HIV-1 gene
        products trigger either cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent or cyclin
        D-independent proliferation in non-lymphoid tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        . In infected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> could disrupt the
        inhibitory binding of pRb to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> independent of endogenous
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D, analogous to transforming viral mechanisms that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bypass</ENAMEX> and down-regulate endogenous cyclin D, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> binding to pRb [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , HHV-8 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> -cyclin binding to and activating
        cyclin-dependent kinase-6 (CDK) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and activation of
        cyclin E by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBV</ENAMEX>-induced 
        c -myc [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Alternatively, HIV-1
        could activate cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent proliferation, as
        exemplified by RSV 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">src</NUMEX>-mediated signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In
        most tissues, the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> is readily discernable. Indeed, if cells depend on
        cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1 →</TIMEX> S transition, passage from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> through the restriction point in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is dependent on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> expression of cyclin D
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, accumulation of nuclear cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin D/CDK</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/6</NUMEX> phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pRb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Then,
        although nuclear-localized cyclin D decreases in S phase in
        individual cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , total cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in asynchronously
        proliferating cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> remain elevated compared to
        quiescent cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In renal epithelial and
        mesenchymal cells, cyclin D 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-type cyclin
        activated during cell-cycle progression, both during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and in non-viral-mediated kidney cell
        proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Here, we ask whether infected podocytes expressing HIV-1
        genes show the hallmarks of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -dependent proliferation, specifically
        the up-regulation of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript and protein expression and
        the subsequent phosphorylation of pRb on serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">780</NUMEX>, a
        target site of active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 /CDK-4/6</ENAMEX> that is not shared with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E/CDK-2</ENAMEX> complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Utilizing two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-characterized</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX> pathogenesis, HIV-1
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> infection of
        cultured podocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] we find not only these
        hallmarks of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -dependent proliferation, but also
        dysregulation of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression that normally occurs with
        cell-cell contact and differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .

          To determine whether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> may be active in promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> → S progression in kidneys
          expressing HIV-1 genes, we utilized a well-characterized
          HIV-1 transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Tg26</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ]

          In order to determine if cyclin D

          kidneys from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three proteinuric 40-day old</TIMEX> transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">littermates</ENAMEX> were

          hyperplastic nephrons in the diseased transgenics versus
          the absent staining of nephrons in the non-transgenics
          consistent with the very low mitotic index in normal
          kidneys of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . This suggests that
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is promoting cell-cycle progression
          during the proliferation of epithelium in diseased

          HIV-1 expression in cultured podocytes recapitulates
          the phenotypic abnormalities induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> expression
          in infected podocytes 
          in vivo, specifically
          proliferation, loss of contact-mediated growth control,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dedifferentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . To determine if these
          phenotypes were marked by enhanced cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and phospho</NUMEX>-pRb (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>) expression,
          we utilized the podocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-culture protocol developed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rieser et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] to study both sub-confluent
          podocyte growth and podocyte growth during the formation
          of mature cell-cell contacts at confluence. In this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, normal podocytes are growth-arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-5 days
          after initial confluence and are fully differentiated
          with mature cell-cell contacts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10 days</TIMEX>
          later. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Ashows</TIMEX> that cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> message levels are nearly equivalent
          between mock ("wild-type")-, control virus-, and
          HIV-1-infected subconfluent podocytes, although only the
          HIV-1-infected subconfluent podocytes had elevated levels
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In contrast, cell-cell
          contact in wild-type and control-infected, but not
          HIV-1-infected podocytes, caused a severe down-regulation
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript and protein concomitant
          with the up-regulation of synaptopodin, a podocyte
          differentiation marker [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 28</ENAMEX> ] , by the end of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-day differentiation period</TIMEX>. Although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected
          podocytes showed some decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> message by the end of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">differentiation</TIMEX> period, cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels remained elevated,
          suggesting activation by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HIV-1</NUMEX> of mechanisms that
          stabilize cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels. Moreover,
          HIV-1-infected podocytes, but not control-infected
          podocytes, had readily detectable phospho-pRb (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>) at
          the end of the differentiation period, suggesting that
          the stably up-regulated cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> remained active in promoting
          cell-cycle progression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). The ongoing
          proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-infected podocytes following
          cell-cell contact led to the formation of multiple foci
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>) with intense, heterogenous nuclear cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> immunofluorescence consistent with
          ongoing asynchronous proliferation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These data indicate that HIV-1
          expression in infected podocytes induces cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and phospho</NUMEX>-pRb (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>) expression,
          hallmarks of cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> → S progression. The data, however,
          do not prove that cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression alone is sufficient to
          cause cell-cycle progression.
        
        
          Requirement of HIV-1 expression for induction of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 1
          We sought to further confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> expression,
          and not some idiosyncratic effect of infection, was
          directly inducing cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression in infected podocytes.
          First, we utilized the small molecule cyclin-dependent
          kinase inhibitor, flavopiridol, which at low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 100</NUMEX> nM) can selectively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">suppress HIV-1</ENAMEX> transcript elongation without altering
          cellular transcripts in cell types of various lineages,
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">podocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 29 30</ENAMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript levels were followed
          before, during, and after treatment of confluent
          wild-type or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected podocytes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nM
          flavopiridol, a dose that suppresses <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> transcription
          by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>, cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , and glyceraldehyde-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-phosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G3PDH</NUMEX>) transcript levels in podocytes
          treated with flavopiridol for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, followed by drug
          washout for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 day</TIMEX>, showed that cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression paralleled HIV-1
          expression in infected podocytes before, during and after
          suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, we
          utilized single gene mutants of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] to determine
          which HIV-1 gene(s) may be involved with up-regulating
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression. Analysis of cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript levels in podocytes
          infected with HIV-1 singly mutated with premature stop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> in the genes encoding the various structural and
          regulatory proteins of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> (except 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tat</ENAMEX> , which is present in every
          virus) showed that 
          nef -deficient virus did not
          significantly up-regulate cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression when compared to the
          other mutant viruses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Taken together, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicate that induction of cyclin D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression requires HIV-1 gene
          expression and that HIV-1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nef</ENAMEX> is important for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The mechanisms whereby HIV-1 subverts cell-cycle
        controls in infected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX> have been unclear.
        Here, we demonstrate that podocytes expressing HIV-1 genes
        display the hallmarks of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle progression,
        specifically, that cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript and protein expression are
        markedly up-regulated, and that levels of phospho-pRb
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>), a target of cyclin D 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 /CDK-4/6</ENAMEX> but not cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E/CDK-2</ENAMEX>
        complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , are induced 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo. In addition, preliminary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-array gene profiling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-infected tubular
        epithelium showed that cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression is up-regulated several
        fold when compared to uninfected tubular epithelium
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ross</ENAMEX>, personal communication). This suggests that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-induced proliferation of infected renal
        epithelium may be caused by a cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -dependent mechanism, unlike other
        viruses that bypass a requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -phase cyclins to trigger aberrant
        cell-cycle progression. Moreover, normal cellular controls
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle progression appears to be dysregulated by
        HIV-1 expression because cell-cell contact and
        differentiation, events that normally lead to the
        down-regulation of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , did not
        significantly alter cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">podocytes</ENAMEX>. This suggests a novel stabilization of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in podocytes by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>. We are
        exploring whether this occurs from enhanced translation of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> message and/or decreased degradation
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and whether other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-type
        cyclins may be involved in phosphorylating pRb in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX>.
        Prior studies in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> support the
        model that HIV-1 gene products interact with endogenous
        mitogenic pathways in infected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Kidney transplants between normal and transgenic
        Tg26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> suggested that specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 proteins</ENAMEX> within
        the kidney, and not circulating factors, transform infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        generated with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">HIV-1 proviral</ENAMEX> construct mutated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nef</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PXXP</ENAMEX>" SH3-binding motif for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Src-family</ENAMEX> kinases failed
        to develop nephropathy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and a recent 
        in vitro analysis of podocytes
        infected with single gene mutants of HIV-1 further suggest
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nef</ENAMEX> plays a central role in causing the proliferative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Utilizing these same single gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> viruses, we showed here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nef</ENAMEX> appears to be play
        a role in the up-regulation of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> by HIV-1 
        in vitro . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, these single
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> do not exclude the possibility that other
        HIV-1 gene(s) may cooperate with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nef</ENAMEX> to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX>, particularly
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tat</ENAMEX> , which is present in every
        virus. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cumulatively</ENAMEX>, however, these observations do suggest
        a mechanism whereby HIV-1 expression in renal epithelium
        may induce cyclin D 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : activation</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Src</ENAMEX>-family kinases by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nef</ENAMEX> would be expected to up-regulate cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene expression and promote the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> and stabilization of cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src-Ras-MAPK</ENAMEX> and
        Src-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PI3K</NUMEX>-mTOR signal transduction pathways, respectively [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, our unpublished 
        in vitro observations and published
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> showing marked expression of basic fibroblast growth
        factor in the interstitium of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX> kidneys [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] suggest
        that soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitogens</ENAMEX> may be important cofactors with HIV-1
        expression to induce cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Thus, interrupting HIV-1 gene
        expression should down-regulate cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and correct the phenotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in infected podocytes. In support of this
        notion, we show here that cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> expression parallels HIV-1 expression
        before, during, and after suppression of HIV-1
        transcription with flavopiridol, and recently, we showed
        that longer periods of treatment with flavopiridol
        ameliorate the phenotypic abnormalities of infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">podocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        The following results of this study suggest that HIV-1
        expression leads to cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> → S progression in infected podocytes:
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcript and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels are
        markedly up-regulated, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phospho-Rb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>) levels are
        increased, cyclin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phospho-Rb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser780</NUMEX>) levels
        do not decrease with podocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cell contact and
        differentiation, and the up-regulation of cyclin D 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> requires the expression of HIV-1
        genes, particularly HIV-1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nef</ENAMEX>. In sum, these results suggest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-induced cell-cycle mechanisms may contribute to
        aberrant epithelial proliferation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIVAN</ENAMEX>.
