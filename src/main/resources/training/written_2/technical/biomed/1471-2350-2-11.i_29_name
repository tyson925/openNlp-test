        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Marfan</ENAMEX> syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant
        connective tissue disorder with an estimated incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> live births [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Besides the classic
        manifestations in the cardiovascular, ocular and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">musculoskeletal</ENAMEX> systems, frequent features include
        spontaneous pneumothorax, inguinal herniae, striae
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atrophicae</ENAMEX> in the skin and lumbosacral dural ectasia. There
        is pronounced inter- and intrafamilial variability. Age of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX> and progression of the various manifestations cover a
        wide range [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> phenotype is the result of mutations in 
        FBN1, a large gene composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
        exons encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> kD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibrillin-1 protein</ENAMEX> that is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major constituent</ENAMEX> of microfibrils in the extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ). To date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX> unique 
        FBN1 mutations have been identified,
        including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.8%</NUMEX>) cysteine substitutions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.3%</NUMEX>)
        other missense mutations, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.4%</NUMEX>) premature termination
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.4%</NUMEX>) exon skipping mutations, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, as listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Human Gene Mutation Database</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGMD</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://archive.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uwcm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/uwcm/mg/search/127115.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        and reported more recently [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Although the 
        FBN1 gene, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        alternatively spliced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated exons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] extends
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> in chromosome band 15q21.1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cse</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsc</ENAMEX>.edu, no major deletions have been
        identified except for one report of an exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-62</NUMEX> genomic
        deletion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Some correlations between 
        FBN1 mutation genotypes and
        phenotypes are emerging. For example, exon-skipping
        mutations in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the gene, exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-32</NUMEX>,
        cause severe phenotypes or neonatal presentations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        But there are exceptions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> of the many other
        mutations in this region cause severe phenotypes, while one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> predicted to lead to skipping of exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> was found
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, most
        cysteine substitutions cause classic MFS with a high
        frequency of lens dislocation, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        our study did not meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghent</ENAMEX> criteria for diagnosis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> not disrupting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disulfide</ENAMEX> bonds may be associated with fibrillinopathies
        other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX>, although mutations in the calcium-binding
        consensus sequence have been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic MFS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . It is clear from the studies
        reported so far, that genotype-phenotype correlations are
        not straight-forward for 
        FBN1 mutations.
        We report here two multi-exon deletion mutations of 
        FBN1 . We located the deletion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> in introns and characterized the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phenotypes</ENAMEX>. Partial deletion of an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-cysteine
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX>-like) domain and loss of the downstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-cysteine
        calcium-binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cb</ENAMEX>) epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (EGF)-like
        domain caused protein instability and classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De novo</ENAMEX> deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three cbEGF</NUMEX>-like
        domains encoded by exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44-46</NUMEX> resulted in a severe form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> diagnosed in infancy. Both mutations lead to the
        synthesis of mutant FBN1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interfere with
        microfibril <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, resulting in significantly reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix microfibrils</ENAMEX>.

            Case 1
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FB774</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 1</ENAMEX>, a female, was born to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> yr
            old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and was noted to have long fingers at birth.
            A diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> was made at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15</TIMEX> yr, based on
            bilateral lens dislocation (upward) and Marfanoid
            skeletal features. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diffuse</ENAMEX> red and pink cutaneous
            striae started to appear at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15</TIMEX>, when obesity
            developed, and progressed throughout life. As an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 1</ENAMEX> had a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186</NUMEX> cm with long arms and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legs</ENAMEX>, a narrow highly arched palate and dental
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crowding</ENAMEX>, chest asymmetry and pectus deformity (upper
            sternum protrudes), hyperextensible large and small
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, arachnodactyly, frequent thumb
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dislocations</ENAMEX>, pes planus, and thin, fragile skin.
            Besides ectopia lentis, ocular features included
            high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myopia</ENAMEX> and glaucoma requiring surgery at age
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 yr.</TIMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac arrhythmia</ENAMEX> was treated with
            beta-blockers. The aortic root diameter was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> cm by
            echocardiogram at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> yr of age. A skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biopsy</ENAMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fibroblast</ENAMEX> culture was obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> yr. There was

            deceased.
          
          
            Case 2
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FB 890</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Born</ENAMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> yr old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> yr old
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 2</ENAMEX> presented as a neonate with striking
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arachnodactyly</ENAMEX> and pectus excavatum. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX>, her
            skeletal measurements were all above the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 th%</NUMEX>ile
            (length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> cm, arm span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> cm, middle finger length 5
            cm, foot length <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cm</NUMEX>) and the upper-to-lower segment
            ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.27</NUMEX> was significantly below normal for age.
            She had mild contractures of elbows and knees, a long
            face with deep-set eyes, bilateral iridodonesis and
            high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myopia</ENAMEX>. Bilateral lens dislocation was
            confirmed at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> yr. During early childhood, she
            developed severe progressive thoracolumbar scoliosis
            (><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 degrees</NUMEX>) requiring spinal fusion procedures.
            Episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">supraventricular tachycardia</ENAMEX> and cardiac
            arrhythmia were treated with cardioversion and
            beta-blockers. Starting in infancy, her aortic root
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dilated</ENAMEX> rapidly to a diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> cm at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> yr.
            She developed mitral regurgitation and mitral and
            tricuspid valve prolapse. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> became
            increasingly hypermobile. Before valve-replacement
            surgery, her severe pectus excavatum was repaired.
            Throughout childhood, she had underdeveloped
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">musculature</ENAMEX> and lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous fat</ENAMEX>. To improve
            her nutritional status, she received nasogastric tube

        Results and Discussion
        We developed a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> approach to screen for
        exon-skipping and large deletion mutations in the 
        FBN1 gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs amplifies overlapping fragments: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exons 1 - 31</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3972 bp</ENAMEX>), exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 - 52</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3011 bp</ENAMEX>) and exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 - 65</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2971</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) from skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblast-</ENAMEX>derived total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The amplicons
        are digested with restriction enzymes that generate
        individually recognizable fragments with known sequence
        content. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were screened with this
        method, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> of which met diagnostic criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        had partial manifestations. All of these skin fibroblast
        samples had previously been screened with a cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification/SSCA</ENAMEX> protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/exon
        amplification method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] with negative results. As
        reported previously, the long RT-PCR method identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        samples with transcripts skipping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exons 18, 31, 46, 49, 56</TIMEX>
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> that were caused by nucleotide substitutions at
        splice sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, skipping of exon
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> was discovered to be due to a silent mutation within the
        exon, possibly affecting a splicing enhancer binding site [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Here we report abnormal fragments seen after 
        Taq I digestion of the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29-52</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). Sequence analysis of the altered cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> revealed a deletion of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 and 43</TIMEX> in patient
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and a deletion of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44-46</NUMEX> in patient 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b).
        In both cases, we found no evidence for sequence
        alterations, when we amplified the deleted and flanking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> and their splice sites individually from genomic DNA
        (data not shown). Therefore, we suspected that these normal
        amplification products were derived from the normal 
        FBN1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX>, and that the mutant
        alleles were not amplified by this approach because they
        carry gross genomic deletions. To test this hypothesis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs were designed from the flanking exon sequences
        for amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long-range PCR</ENAMEX> analysis
        revealed genomic deletions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX> kb in size, in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For Case 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P1</NUMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kb amplicon was
        obtained instead of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> kb amplicon in the normal control
        sample. For Case 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P2</NUMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX> kb product was amplified
        instead of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.2</NUMEX> kb product in the normal control. In
        both cases, the PCR conditions used favored the
        amplification of the shorter (mutant) fragment, although
        the normal allele was also present in the genomic PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Direct sequencing of the deletion
        junction amplicons revealed the location of the intronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX>. Both deletion events generated clean junctions
        with no missing or inserted nucleotides. In Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, the
        breakpoints are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 300</NUMEX> nt downstream from exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>, while in Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, they are located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300 nt</NUMEX> upstream
        of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44 and 47</TIMEX>. In Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of identical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentamers</ENAMEX> (cagta and ggaaa) were identified near the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">introns 41 and 43</TIMEX>. In Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, the exchange
        occurred within an identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentamer</ENAMEX> (atttt) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        None of these sequences are known to predispose to genomic
        rearrangements, although short stretches of identical
        sequence are often found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of germline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> and deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breakpoints</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Genomic analysis of the parents and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> of Case 2
        indicated that the mutation was sporadic. Although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were not available for study, the
        negative family history suggests that this deletion is also
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX>. Slightly advanced paternal
        age (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> yr and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> yr, respectively) may be a factor in both
        cases.
        The effects of the two deletions were studied at the
        protein level by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-cysteine pulse-chase analysis. Both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> mRNAs encode internally deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> without a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frameshift</ENAMEX>. In Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44-46</NUMEX>, fibrillin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> was normal (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">109%</NUMEX> of control), indicating that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mutant fibrillin</ENAMEX> molecules are stable. The mutant protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">band</ENAMEX>, expected to be 122 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> shorter, was not
        resolved on our gel system. The deposition of newly
        synthesized fibrillin into the matrix was greatly reduced
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> of normal), however, suggesting that the internally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deleted mutant fibrillin-1</ENAMEX> molecules are secreted and exert
        a dominant-negative effect on extracellular microfibril
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patient 1, the</ENAMEX> in-frame deletion of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42-43</NUMEX>
        removed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thLTBP
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-cysteine</ENAMEX>) domain and the adjacent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> thcalcium-binding
        EGF-like domain. Fibrillin synthesis levels were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and, in addition, matrix deposition was
        disproportionately reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). An
        earlier independent study of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s fibroblasts had
        revealed similar results: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> for synthesis and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deposition</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Aoyama</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). To determine
        whether the low value for synthesis was due to reduced
        mutant transcript levels, we made use of the 
        Rsa I restriction site polymorphism
        in the 
        FBN1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'UTR for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygous</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCA</ENAMEX> patterns of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rsa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I digested RT-PCR</ENAMEX> products were
        indistinguishable from controls, indicating that transcript
        levels were equal for both alleles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). This leads us
        to conclude that the mutant mRNA is stable but that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, containing a partially deleted LTBP-domain,
        if synthesized, is unstable and may be processed to smaller
        fragments by proteolytic cleavage. The methods we used did
        not allow us to detect such hypothetical proteolytic
        fragments.
        Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> 
        FBN1 mutations reported, only one is
        a multi-exon deletion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . It involves deletion of exons
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-62 encoding three contiguous cbEGF</TIMEX>-like domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        This deletion co-segregated with affected status in a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation family</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Skeletal</ENAMEX> involvement was characterized
        by a moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marfanoid</ENAMEX> habitus with mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">scoliosis</ENAMEX> and
        hypermobility of large and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. Ectopia lentis was
        absent. Retinal detachment was reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
        Cardiovascular features included aortic dilatation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-life, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case of dissection at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 56</TIMEX> yr, and a high
        frequency of mitral valve prolapse associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrhythmia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> studies with
        fibrillin-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> revealed the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        kD-smaller mutant polypeptide in the medium of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolically</ENAMEX> labeled mutant fibroblasts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
        shortened molecule was incorporated into the extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> and apparently caused major disruptions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfibrils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 2</ENAMEX> described here also has a deletion of three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> cbEGF-like domains, those encoded by exons
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44-46</NUMEX>. This deletion resulted in a more severe phenotype
        with onset in infancy and a rapidly progressing clinical
        course. Thus, it appears that deletion of three contiguous
        EGF-like domains can have different effects depending on
        their location within the fibrillin-1 molecule. Deletion of
        the EGF-like domains encoded by exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-62</NUMEX> in the
        C-terminal domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibrillin-1</ENAMEX> results in a much less
        severe phenotype than deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> EGF-like domains in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> longest stretch of EGF-like domains (between
        exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43-49</NUMEX>). It has been reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of mutations
        identified in the region between exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59-65</NUMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 7%</NUMEX>
        of mutations in other regions, were associated with mild
        Marfan-like phenotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Our results are in line
        with the notion of this general genotype-phenotype
        correlation.
        Deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> EGF-like domain due to exon skipping,
        especially in the region between exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 and 32</TIMEX>, usually
        causes severe neonatal-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 24 25</ENAMEX> ] . Similar
        deletions in other regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibrillin-1</ENAMEX> may also result
        in early onset of cardiovascular symptoms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Patient
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, described here, had a genomic deletion of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> that results in an in-frame deletion of part of the 5th
        LTBP-like domain and the adjacent downstream cbEGF-like
        domain. Diagnosed as a teenager, patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> had the skeletal
        and skin findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX>, bilateral dislocated lenses and,
        at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> yr, a mildly dilated aortic root. In
        contrast to the cases with deleted EGF-like domains, her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was unstable. We obtained a similar result
        in a case of exon 51 skipping due to a silent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C>T</ENAMEX>
        transition at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">CpG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dinucleotide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In-frame deletion
        of exon 51 removes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> thLTBP-like
        domain. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s fibroblasts, fibrillin synthesis
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> of control and deposition was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, while
        the mutant mRNA level was normal as shown here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
        In addition, we found that certain cysteine substitutions
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>-like domains and located immediately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of
        LTBP-like domains, cause protein instability and greatly
        reduced matrix deposition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Taken together, our data
        support a model in which misfolding or partial deletion of
        LTBP-like domains results in proteolytic cleavage of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mutant fibrillin</ENAMEX> molecules. We hypothesize that truncated
        intermediates interfere with microfibril <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and,
        thus, produce the low levels of matrix deposition observed.
        This hypothesis is not only based on analysis of Case 1
        reported here but on a similar analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> previously
        reported cases, one with exon 51 skipping [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        with cysteine substitutions immediately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTBP</ENAMEX> like domains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . It is also possible, however,
        that proteolytic fragments of the mutant protein associate
        with the normal length fibrillin molecules and inhibit
        their secretion. Future focused mechanistic studies are
        needed to test our hypothesis.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FBN1</NUMEX> mutation detection rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        clinically diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFS</ENAMEX> is currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX> when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is completely screened with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>
        amplification protocol of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Genomic deletions such as the ones reported here are not a
        frequent cause of human disease and would be missed by this
        approach. To search for additional large genomic
        rearrangements, we carried out Southern analyses of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">BamH I,</ENAMEX> 
        Sac I and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II digested genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        fibroblasts strains that were negative for 
        FBN1 mutation screening by other
        methods, but had shown abnormal fibrillin biosynthetic
        profiles by pulse-chase analysis. The blots were hybridized
        successively with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> overlapping long-range RT-PCR
        fragments covering the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FBN1</NUMEX> coding region, that were
        generated from a normal cDNA template as described above.
        While we identified several restriction fragment length
        polymorphisms, no evidence for major deletions or
        rearrangements was found (data not shown). Thus, we have
        only detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomic deletions out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease-causing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FBN1</ENAMEX> mutations identified in our
        laboratory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Human Gene Mutation Database</ENAMEX> (as of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">08/14/01</NUMEX>) contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,345</NUMEX> unique mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1069</TIMEX> genes.
        Of those, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1166</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) are gross deletions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://archive.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uwcm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/uwcm/mg/hgmd0.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        suggesting that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FBN1</ENAMEX> genomic deletions await
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>. Multi-exon deletions are easily detected with
        the long RT-PCR method we used here, that requires <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
        fibroblast cultures, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analyses of
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are much more laborious and more difficult to
        interpret. Whereas most published genotype-phenotype
        correlation studies compare the nucleotide changes at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> level with the list of phenotypic features, we feel
        strongly that studies of the mutant alleles at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
        protein level are necessary to take some of the guesswork
        out of these correlations.
