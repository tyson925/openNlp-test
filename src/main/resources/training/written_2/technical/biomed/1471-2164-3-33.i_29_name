        Organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate compounds</ENAMEX> are the central metabolites
        of all biological systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Some are the basic
        building blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>, some like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>,
        are additionally, cellular energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, others like cAMP
        or cGMP are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> in signal transduction, and, yet
        others, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiamine phosphates</ENAMEX> and pyridoxal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> are cofactors for a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein domains</ENAMEX> belonging to a relatively small set of
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folds</ENAMEX> are known to bind or catalyze reactions
        that utilize these organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate compounds</ENAMEX> (see SCOP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">database: http://scop.</ENAMEX>mrc-lmb.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cam</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/scop/</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Several of these folds trace back to some of the earliest
        phases of the evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> world, and
        participate in a wide range of disparate biological
        functions in extant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folds</ENAMEX>, such as
        the P-loop fold, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossmann</ENAMEX> fold and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Hsp70</NUMEX>-like fold,
        have been well studied, and comprise mainly of dedicated
        nucleotide binding or hydrolyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Others, such as the palm-domain, which is found in adenylyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclases</ENAMEX> and various nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid polymerases</ENAMEX>, belong to
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">generalized protein folds</ENAMEX> that contain representatives
        with diverse biochemical activities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . Current
        availability of extensive genome sequence data, allows one
        to identify less numerous, nevertheless biological
        important organic phosphate-binding domains that may have
        previous eluded detection. The identification of such
        domain superfamilies, containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> with several
        different activities, often throws considerable light on
        their evolution, structure and catalytic mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 12</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The majority of previously known nucleotide cyclases
        belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major folds. The classical adenylyl cyclases,
        guanylyl cyclases and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGDEF</ENAMEX> (diguanylate cyclase)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> share the catalytic palm domain with the family B
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerases</ENAMEX>, reverse transcriptases, viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dependent RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> and eukaryote-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . The pathogenic adenylyl cyclases of several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CyaA</ENAMEX>-like proteobacteria adenylyl cyclases
        are extremely divergent versions of the catalytic domain
        seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol-β</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of nucleotidyl transferases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        (also see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> database:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://scop.</ENAMEX>mrc-lmb.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cam</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/scop/</ENAMEX>). While the catalytic
        domains of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superfamilies</ENAMEX> have very different
        folds, they follow a similar reaction mechanism that is
        dependent on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ions coordinated by a cluster of
        acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> adenylyl cyclase, which
        was identified in the bacterium 
        Aeromonas hydrophila is unrelated to
        any of these above superfamilies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Though
        close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of this enzyme exist in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, like
        
        Yersinia pestis and 
        Borrelia burgdorferi and the archaea,
        its antecedents or catalytic mechanism have not been
        understood. Using sensitive sequence profile comparison
        methods, we show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CyaB</ENAMEX>-like adenylyl cyclases are
        homologs of the soluble mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> triphosphatases
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and they define a novel superfamily of enzymes
        that utilize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and other organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphates</ENAMEX>. We present
        evidence that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of this domain was present
        in the last common ancestor of all extant life forms. The
        primary biological function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> appears to be
        related to polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism. Cyclic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thiamine triphosphate hydrolysis</ENAMEX> appear
        to be secondarily acquired activities. We also identify the
        potential active site- and substrate interacting-residues
        and postulate that these enzymes are likely to catalyze a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-metal ion dependent reaction on structural scaffold
        that is completely different from that seen in the other
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> superfamilies of adenylyl cyclases.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of the CYTH domain
          In order to understand the evolutionary affinities and
          provenance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> adenylyl cyclase from 
          Aeromonas hydrophila , we carried
          out database searches using sensitive sequence profile
          analysis methods. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with no
          detectable low complexity regions, we used it as a seed
          to initiate a PSI-BLAST search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] (run to
          convergence, with expect-value for inclusion in profile =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.01</NUMEX>). The search resulted in the detection of its obvious
          orthologs from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yersinia</ENAMEX> and various archaea at
          significant expect (e) values ranging from from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-43to 8 × 10 -5.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> iteration recovered proteins
          from more archaea, eukaryotes (e-value: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 × 10 -7</ENAMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clostridium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 × 10 -8</ENAMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borrelia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 × 10 -8</ENAMEX>). Further
          iterations, run to convergence, recovered the soluble
          mammalian thiamine triphosphatases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 × 10 -4</ENAMEX>), and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli YgiF</ENAMEX>. At convergence,
          several bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, that showed a conserved EXEXK
          (where <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> is any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) characteristic of this
          family, and a region C-terminal to a P-loop like uridine
          kinase domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were also recovered at borderline
          e-values (e value ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches
          initiated with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli YgiF protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-200</ENAMEX>), not only recovered its bacterial orthologs,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archaeal CyaB</ENAMEX> homologs and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but also
          several others such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis YjbK</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanosarcina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ma2350</ENAMEX>, and 
          Mesorhizobium loti <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mll4592</TIMEX> with
          e-values in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4-10</NUMEX> -6upon <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detection.
          Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transitive</ENAMEX> searches initiated from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">region C-</ENAMEX>terminal to the uridine kinase of the plants
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49D11.13</NUMEX> from 
          Oryza sativa , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250-410</ENAMEX>)
          recovered archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> homologs confirming their
          relationship to with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> detected in these
          searches. Regular expression searches with the
          conservation pattern found in these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">CyaB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> also
          recovered the most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> detected in the
          above-mentioned profile searches, but failed to recover
          any new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
          In all these searches, the alignments more or less
          spanned the entire length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
          typically contained the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling procedure revealed the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> conserved motifs, with a probability of chance
          occurrence <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -14</NUMEX>, in the search space
          comprising of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that were identified
          in the above searches as having this domain. We clustered
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> using the BLASTCLUST program in several
          smaller clusters and prepared multiple alignments for the
          individual clusters and predicted secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for
          these set using the PHD program. A nearly complete
          congruence was seen in the comparison of the secondary
          structures of the individual clusters. In many cases, the
          region of similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> comprised the entire length
          of the target protein detected in these searches.
          However, in some cases it only comprised a part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, with rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> being made of other
          globular domains. These observations, taken together,
          suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> and soluble mammalian thiamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">triphosphatases</ENAMEX> define a novel superfamily of conserved
          domains, which may either occur by itself or in
          combination with other domains. We named this domain the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy aB,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> iamine triphosphatase) domain
          after the two experimentally characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          which it is present.
        
        
          Sequence conservation, structure and biochemical
          activities of the CYTH domain
          All complete CYTH domain sequences were aligned using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program, and this alignment was further
          refined based on the PSI-BLAST <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX>, conserved motifs
          detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling procedure and predicted
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A
          text copy of the alignment is being provided as an
          additional file (see additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">file1and</NUMEX> additional file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The predicted secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for this domain
          indicated an α+β fold, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> conserved β-strands and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          conserved α-helices. Neither the predicted secondary
          structure, nor the pattern of the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          revealed an obvious relationship with any previously
          recognized fold. Given that the CYTH domain is the only
          globular domain in the enzymes, thiamine triphosphatase
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CyaB</ENAMEX>, it is predicted to be an enzymatic domain.
          While the reactions catalyzed by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> are
          distinct, their substrates, respectively thiamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, are both organic triphosphates. The
          CYTH domain is also present <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal to the catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-loop containing domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and slime mold
          uridine kinase homologs. In these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> it is likely
          to interact with nucleoside diphosphates or
          triphosphates, which are substrates for these kinases.
          These observations suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains are
          likely to be domains specialized to bind nucleotides and
          other organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphates</ENAMEX>. A multiple alignment of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superfamily</ENAMEX> reveals the presence of several nearly
          universally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are likely to
          form the active site of these enzymes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The most
          prominent of these are an EXEXK motif associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand-1</ENAMEX> of the domain, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helix-2</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> at the end of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, an E in strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, a basic
          residue in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helix-4</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> at the end of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and two</NUMEX>
          acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (typically glutamates) in strand 6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The presence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 6</NUMEX> conserved acidic positions
          in the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains suggests that it
          coordinates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> divalent metal ions. Analogous active
          sites, that coordinate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> metal ions, are observed in
          domains with similar activities, such as the classical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">adenylyl/guanylyl</ENAMEX> cyclases, family B <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerases</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol-β</ENAMEX> fold nucleotidyl transferases, and triphosphatases
          or phosphoesterases of the HD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superfamilies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Consistent with these observations, both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThTPase</ENAMEX> have been shown to require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ions for
          their nucleotide cyclase and phosphatase activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] .

          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the CYTH domain
          are most probably involved in the binding of acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> moieties of their substrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
          conservation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the
          majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains suggests that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are likely to possess an activity dependent on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> metal ions, with a preference for nucleotides or
          related phosphate-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">moiety</NUMEX>-bearing substrates. The proposed
          biochemical activity, and the arrangement of predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strands</ENAMEX> in the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the CYTH domain imply
          that the may adopt a barrel or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configuration</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ions</ENAMEX> and the substrate bound in
          the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cavity</ENAMEX>. The only prominent exceptions to the
          basic conservation pattern of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains are the
          versions found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and 
          Dictyostelium pyrimidine kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At1g26190</NUMEX>-like). These versions lack 5
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> conserved acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, but retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This leads to the
          prediction that these CYTH domains are catalytically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX>. However, as they retain the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
          they probably still bind the organic phosphate
          substrates, and function as regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> that are
          linked to P-loop kinase domains.
        
        
          Phyletic patterns, evolutionary history and
          potential biological functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains are present in most of the major
          lineages, for which sequence information is currently
          available, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal superkingdomains of
          life (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We used the multiple alignment of the CYTH
          domain to construct phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> using the least
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">squares</ENAMEX>, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). The monophyletic clusters
          that emerged in this analysis were essentially the same
          as those that were derived through similarity based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTCLUST</ENAMEX>. The majority of archaeal and
          eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> formed a monophyletic cluster to the
          exclusion of most of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (RELL
          Bootstrap support <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This cluster was also
          supported by a unique synapomorphy (a shared derived
          character) in the form of a conserved motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dh</ENAMEX>; where h
          is a hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>) associated with the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology
          resembles that of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in core
          cellular functions such as the DNA recombinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecA</ENAMEX>,
          aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolism proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . This suggests that a
          CYTH domain was present in the last universal common
          ancestor of all extant life forms and the extant forms
          are in part vertically inherited from this ancestral
          form.
          However, there are certain anomalies to this pattern.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains are entirely absent from the small
          genomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogenic bacteria</ENAMEX> such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> and 
          Chlamydia as well as some of the
          large genomes such as 
          Deinococcus radiodurans . At least,
          a single copy of the CYTH domain is seen in most archaeal
          and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> sampled to date, with the
          exception of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and the yeasts, where
          it is absent. This implies that the CYTH domain has been
          lost independently on a number of occasions in evolution.
          CyaB homologs from 
          Aeromonas , 
          Clostridium, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borrelia</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ralstonia</ENAMEX> lie firmly (RELL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrap ></ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>) within the archaeal and eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, rather than with their bacterial counterparts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These bacterial forms also share the unique
          sequence signature in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand with this group
          suggesting that they have been derived through horizontal
          transfer from different archaeal and eukaryotic sources
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In particular the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> homolog from 
          Ralstonia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> very strongly with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> versions and appears to be a recent horizontal
          transfer in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> from the latter clade. The
          possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aeromonas CyaB</ENAMEX> from an archaeal
          source has been previously suggested, and is consistent
          with the enzyme being optimally functional under high
          temperature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains in
          the euryarchaeon 
          Methanosarcina acetivorans , in
          addition to the version which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with the CYTH
          domains that are found, in single or duplicate copies, in
          other archaea and eukaryotes. These former versions,
          strongly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains from actinobacteria
          (Rell Boostrap <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) to the exclusion of other lineage
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Furthermore, they share a fusion to a novel
          conserved domain with characteristic histidines (see
          below) with the actinobacterial versions. Thus they
          appear to have been transferred laterally from the
          actinobacteria into the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Methanosarcina</ENAMEX> lineage followed by
          a small lineage specific expansion in the latter.
          Bacteriophages, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RB49</ENAMEX>, that contain a solo CYTH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, which is closer to the version seen in its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">proteobacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, could have served as conduits for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> distribution of this domain.
          The phyletic pattern of the CYTH domain is not very
          typical of signaling enzymes like nucleotide cyclases.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classic</ENAMEX> adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases show a far more
          sporadic distribution, and are often present in multiple
          copies fused to a variety of signaling domains such as
          the cyclic nucleotide binding domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Cyclic
          nucleotide generating activity is not known to exist in a
          subset of the archaea [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , though most of them
          contain a well-conserved copy of the CYTH domain.
          Experimental analysis on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methanococcus CyaB</ENAMEX> homolog revealed
          no adenylyl cyclase activity comparable to that seen in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeromonas CyaB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Likewise,
          there is no evidence for a widespread presence of the
          ThTPase activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that contain CYTH
          domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Hence, the principal biological
          function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains may be different from those
          of the experimentally characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this
          family. General conservation of this domain across a
          range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and its presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LUCA</ENAMEX> suggests
          the possibility of an important general role in cellular
          process of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. In order to decipher
          the potential biological roles of this domain we used
          different forms of contextual information regarding these
          domains, in the form of domain architectures, gene
          neighborhoods (predicted operons) and experimental
          evidence for interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Both domain
          architecture and operon analysis have been used
          extensively to make functional predictions of poorly
          characterized domains or genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
          Moreover, the presence of evolutionarily conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operons</ENAMEX> often correlates with the involvement of the
          component genes in a sequential pathway or physically
          interacting complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . We summarize the
          different forms of contextual information that we
          extracted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains in the form a network
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagram</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The CYTH domain shows a small array set of fusions to
          other conserved domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most
          prevalent fusions is to an uncharacterized domain, with a
          characteristic pattern of conserved histidines and other
          charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. This domain is predicted to adopt an
          α-helical fold and is according referred to as CHAD
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHAD</ENAMEX>: 
          c onserved 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> istidine 
          α -helical 
          d omain; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The sequence
          conservation pattern (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) suggests that this domain
          is likely to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helices</ENAMEX> each, at its core. While no clear functional
          prediction can be made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHAD</ENAMEX>, the conserved
          charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> could form a strongly polar surface that
          could participate, either in metal chelation, or act as
          phospho-acceptors. Another notable fusion is with a
          specific version of the HD hydrolase domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
          which is also found fused to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
          HSP70-fold domain in the exopolyphosphatase (PPX) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). HD domains typically possess phosphoesterase
          activity, and are fused to catalytic domains that possess
          nucleotide kinase, nucleotidyltransferase, nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclase</ENAMEX> or diguanylate cyclase activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 29</NUMEX> ] . This
          fits well with the observed cyclase activity seen in
          CyaB, but is also consistent with phosphotransferase or
          nucleotidyl transferase for the CYTH domain. Finally,
          catalytically inactive versions of the CYTH domain are
          found fused to the nucleotide kinase domain in uridine
          kinase homologs and may serve as an allosteric
          nucleotide-binding site in these enzymes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          In terms of conserved gene neighborhoods,
          CYTH-domain-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, like mll4592 from
          α-proteobacteria, are frequently found in the
          neighborhood of genes encoding solo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHADs (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Additionally, in 
          Methanosarcina the CYTH-encoding
          genes are found in predicted operons or in the
          neighborhood of genes encoding exopolyphosphatase (PPX)
          and polyphosphate kinase (PPK). Furthermore, in 
          Sulfolobus , a gene for a CHAD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is in a predicted operon along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
          thymidylate kinase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPX</ENAMEX>. CHAD- and CTYH-encoding genes
          are also found in the neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPX</ENAMEX> in 
          Chlorobium tepidum and 
          Geobacter metallireducens ,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Genes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-occur in predicted operons with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for another
          polyphosphate utilizing enzyme, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphate-dependent NAD</ENAMEX> kinase (PPNK), in certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> (eg. 
          Prochlorococcus marinus ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gram</ENAMEX>
          positive bacteria like 
          Oceanobacillus iheyensis . Other
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> are furnished by the co-occurrence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for CYTH-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
          with nucleoside polyphosphate metabolism. These include
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-occurrence with the gene for adenosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetraphosphatase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APAH</ENAMEX>; eg. in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magnetococcus sp</ENAMEX>. ) and with genes
          encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YjbM</ENAMEX>-domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The
          YjbM domain, most often, occurs fused to pentaphosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanosine-3</ENAMEX>'-pyrophosphohydrolase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpoT</ENAMEX>) and GTP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrophosphokinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RelA</ENAMEX>), suggesting a role for it in the
          metabolism of the stringent-response nucleoside
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphate</ENAMEX>.
          These contextual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> are consistent with the
          participation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYTH</ENAMEX> domains in organo-phosphate
          biochemistry, and circumstantially associate it with the
          metabolic network related to polyphosphates and
          nucleoside polyphospates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Specifically,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPX</ENAMEX> have been shown to, respectively, lengthen or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shorten polyphosphate polymers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes
          also appear to interact with the nucleotide metabolism of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPNK</ENAMEX> can utilize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>)
          to synthesize nucleoside polyphosphates, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPK</ENAMEX> along
          with adenylate kinase can carry out
          polyphosphate-dependent phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ]
          . Hence, it is likely that the CYTH domain proteins
          participate directly in this biochemical network along
          with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the CYTH
          domains utilize polyphosphates to synthesize different
          organo-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate derivatives</ENAMEX> including nucleotides.
          Alternatively, they could also function as
          phosphoesterases that hydrolyze particular nucleoside
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX>. These leads could aid further
          experimental investigations on the CYTH domain that might
          help in uncovering ancient, as-yet-unexplored links
          between polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism.
          Finally, at least in some lineages, the CYTH domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> may have been secondarily recruited for other
          functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such case
          where after the original transfer from an archaeon into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">proteobacterial</ENAMEX> lineage it may have acquire the novel
          function as an adenylyl cyclase. However, it is entirely
          possible that even in this case the adenylyl cyclase
          activity is secondary to some other uncharacterized
          metabolic activity. The vertebrate soluble thiamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> has undergone accelerated divergence, as
          it is present on a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the phylogenetic</TIMEX> tree
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThTPase</ENAMEX> is also unusual in lacking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          rdconserved acidic domain of the CYTH domain. Hence, it
          may represent a case of relatively recent acquisition of
          a new catalytic activity.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We show that 
        Aeromonas adenylyl cyclase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CyaB</ENAMEX> and
        thiamine triphosphatase define a novel superfamily of
        catalytic domains that act on nucleotides and
        organo-phosphate substrates. These domains are widely
        distributed in all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> superkingdoms of life and can be
        traced back to the last ancestor of all life forms. We
        identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> conserved acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, that are likely to
        form the active site of these enzymes, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> conserved
        basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, that may participate in interactions with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphate-moiety-containing substrates.</ENAMEX> We postulate that
        these enzymes are likely to chelate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> divalent cations and
        are likely follow a bimetal reaction mechanism similar to
        what has been proposed for nucleotide cyclases, nucleic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid polymerases</ENAMEX>, or certain phosphoesterases such as those
        of the HD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHH</ENAMEX> superfamilies. A version of the CYTH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, which is fused to the catalytic domain of
        nucleotide kinases, lacks the predicted catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
        and probably function as an allosteric regulatory domain.
        Additionally, we detected a novel domain, termed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHAD</ENAMEX>,
        which occurs fused to the CYTH domain or is encoded by
        genes occurring in the same operon as those encoding CYTH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHAD</ENAMEX> contains conserved histidines that are
        predicted to either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chelate metals</ENAMEX> or serve as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphoacceptors</ENAMEX>. Based on phyletic distribution and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> information, we conclude that these enzymes may
        play a critical role in the interface between nucleotide
        and polyphosphate metabolism.
      
      
        Methods
        The non-redundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) was searched using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> and PSI-BLAST
        programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Profile searches using the PSI-BLAST
        program were conducted either with a single sequence or an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> used as the query, with a profile inclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> and were iterated
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>. Additionally, hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> model based
        searches using a multiple alignment of known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were
        run using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HMMER2</NUMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling
        procedure, as implemented in the MACAW program was used to
        detect and evaluate statistically significant conserved
        motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were constructed using
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , followed by manual correction
        based on the PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary structure
        was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPRED</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> programs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . Preliminary
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was done using the BLASTCLUST
        program with empirically determined length and score
        threshold cut off values (For documentation see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ftp://ftp.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/blast/documents/README</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bcl</ENAMEX>).
        Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor
        joining or least square method followed by local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> using the maximum likelihood algorithm to
        predict the most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The robustness of tree
        topology was assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resampling</ENAMEX> of Estimated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Log Likelihoods</ENAMEX> (RELL) bootstrap replicates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLPHY</ENAMEX> and
        Phylip software packages were used for phylogenetic
        analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] .
