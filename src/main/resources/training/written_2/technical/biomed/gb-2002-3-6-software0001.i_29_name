        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> technology has radically changed the way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> address many biological questions. It is now
        possible to measure messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels quantitatively for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes, or even entire genomes, using DNA
        arrays, microarrays or 'chips' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> can, in
        a fairly straightforward fashion, examine the overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes in normal
        cells and tissues, in disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, in response to
        biological, genetic or chemical stimuli (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>), or
        during normal biological processes such as cell-cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and embryonic development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the most commonly used microarrays for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression measurements are oligonucleotide GeneChip
        Â®expression arrays made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> and custom-made cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays are created by a
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and photolithographic
        techniques, whereas cDNA arrays are constructed by spotting
        or printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products or oligonucleotides onto glass
        slides [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Affymetrix arrays contain sets of
        multiple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mer oligonucleotide probes specific for each
        gene or expressed-sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>), whereas spotted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> generally contain longer cDNA probes (usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>) or oligonucleotide probes (usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 to 60</NUMEX>
        bases) for each gene.
        The large amount of information generated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> has been a great strength, but is sometimes
        seen as a frustrating weakness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. A significant
        obstacle in microarray research has been the inability to
        process experimental data easily, assess the data quality,
        manage multiple data sets and mine the data with
        user-friendly tools that can be quickly learned and applied
        for routine analysis by laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HTML</ENAMEX>-based microarray filtering and analysis
        programs were written, one for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> platform
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX>) and one for the cDNA platform (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spot</ENAMEX>) to address
        common data-analysis needs. Our aim in creating Bullfrog
        and Spot is to provide simple tools that enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        at all levels to analyze their data in multiple ways
        without having to use more complex software, without having
        to call in bioinformatics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, and without having to
        learn to program in scripting or database languages.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot were built with an easy-to-navigate user
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> and adjustable analysis criteria, and were
        written to run quickly, allowing multiple microarray
        experiments to be filtered in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several seconds</TIMEX>. They were
        created to provide the bench <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> with uncomplicated
        tools that help focus microarray data from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of</NUMEX>
        genes to a relatively small number of high-confidence,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed candidates. The programs are not
        intended for high-level statistical or other complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, but they do make it easy to export filtered data
        to GeneSpringâ„¢ or other visualization and clustering
        programs. Lastly, the programs are freeware, made publicly
        available to the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in the hope of
        accelerating functional genomics research.
      
      
        Manipulating data sets in Bullfrog
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot can be used to select <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (probes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> or spots) that behave in specific ways across
        multiple experiments by using a combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX>
        different qualitative and quantitative criteria (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        To illustrate a few of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX>'s capabilities, we use data
        obtained in gene-expression studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> mouse
        brain using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. A
        simple question to ask is, "what genes are differentially
        expressed between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different regions of the brain (for
        example, the cerebellum and the amygdala) in a
        129S6<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/SvEvTac</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">129SvEv</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inbred</ENAMEX> mouse strain?" As in most
        experiments, it is important to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estimate the
        false-positive rate for this type of comparison between
        brain regions. The best way to realistically approximate
        the false-positive rate is to perform and analyze
        independent experimental replicates of the same brain
        region from multiple different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the
        cerebellums of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> prepared
        separately and hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different chips. Ideally,
        replicate comparisons from well-controlled experiments
        would show no differentially expressed genes. However,
        experimental noise and biological variation may lead to
        genes being scored as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. For example, small differences in the brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissections</ENAMEX> or differences in the exact time of sacrifice
        can affect gene-expression patterns. It is very important
        to estimate the false-positive rate for the particular
        experimental system being studied, and to set analysis
        filter criteria that lead to appropriate levels of false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> without sacrificing sensitivity to low-abundance
        mRNA transcripts or subtle changes in gene expression.
        To estimate the false-positive rate, a comparison
        between the data for independent replicate 129SvEv
        cerebellums was made (that is, expression data from mouse 1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cerebellum</ENAMEX> versus expression data from mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cerebellum).
        This comparison file (saved as text from the Affymetrix
        GeneChip Â®MAS <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> software) was loaded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and
        the filter criteria were selected. A number of different
        criteria may be selected, but our default criteria for
        calling a gene 'differentially expressed' are as follows: a
        qualitative difference call of 'Increase' (I), 'Marginal
        Increase' (MI), 'Decrease' (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) or 'Marginal Decrease' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>),
        a fold change (expression ratio) of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>, an
        average difference change of greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> (after scaling
        to a mean signal, or target value, across the entire array
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>), and an absolute call of 'Present' for the probe
        set in either or both replicate cerebellums. The use of
        multiple filter criteria reduces the risk of erroneously
        assigning a gene as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed, while
        maintaining sensitivity to rare mRNAs and small differences
        in expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>].
        When applied to the cerebellum replicate data, the
        filter criteria yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> scored as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,529</NUMEX>, a false-positive
        rate of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX>. We have carried out a large
        number of analyses using a combination of qualitative and
        quantitative filters and consistently observe
        false-positive rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1.0%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> well
        controlled independent duplicates using the default
        selection criteria [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 12, 13</ENAMEX>]. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> duplicate
        comparisons for data from different brain regions and
        different strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were analyzed using the default
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> and quantitative criteria. The number of probe
        sets out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,529</NUMEX> that were scored as 'differentially
        expressed' ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 64</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.02% to 1.0%</NUMEX> of the total
        considered), with a mean value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) and a median
        value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>. For the cerebellum data, decreasing the
        fold-change cut-off from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> increased the number of
        selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>. A lower false-positive rate was
        achieved, at the expense of sensitivity, by increasing the
        average difference (signal) change requirement from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> and maintaining the qualitative criteria and the
        fold-change threshold at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>. The average difference
        (signal) is proportional to mRNA abundance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and the
        average difference change is the difference between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity for a probe set on chip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and the signal
        intensity for that same probe set on chip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Raising the
        average difference-change threshold to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> copies of the mRNA transcript per
        cell on average [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> scored as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed, producing a very low
        false-positive rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 0.2%</NUMEX>.
        A common mistake when analyzing gene-expression data
        from oligonucleotide arrays is to ignore the qualitative
        calls (absolute and difference calls) and focus solely on
        the quantitative values (for example, the average
        difference, fold change and average difference change). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> calls are important, however, because they
        provide an assessment of the consistency of the behavior
        across the multiple probes in a probe set. The use of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> calls enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to determine not only whether
        there is a signal (or a signal change), but also whether
        the signal (or the signal change) is due to the gene for
        which the probe set was designed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Signals or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> changes that are not consistent across a probe set
        should not be interpreted with confidence. Ignoring the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> calls in an analysis of the replicate 129SvEv
        cerebellum data and using only quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thresholds</ENAMEX> (a
        fold change greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> and an average difference
        change greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) yielded a long list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">715</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        scored as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed. In other words,
        ignoring the qualitative calls increased the false-positive
        rate by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. To maintain the low false-positive
        rate obtained with the combination of qualitative and
        quantitative criteria (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 0.6%</NUMEX>) using only the
        quantitative fold change and average difference change
        criteria, the thresholds would have to be set very high
        (for example, fold change greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> and average
        difference change greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>). Fold change and signal
        change thresholds this high result in a tremendous loss in
        sensitivity. This example demonstrates that an effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to preserve a low false-positive rate while maintaining
        high sensitivity is to use a combination of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> and quantitative filters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> is designed
        to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> apply these types of multiple-criteria
        analyses.
        The best way to reduce the false-positive rate is to
        combine the filtering criteria described above with the use
        of multiple independent experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicates</ENAMEX>. Inclusion
        of expression measurements for cerebellar mRNA from two
        additional 129SvEv <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (cerebellums from mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and mouse
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) further reduces the false-positive rate. To include data
        from more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, a file for the comparison between
        independent replicate cerebellums from mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and mouse 4
        was created in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cb3 versus Cb4</ENAMEX>). This comparison
        file was loaded into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> along with the comparison
        between the data for mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and mouse 2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
        filter criteria were set to select genes that scored as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in both comparisons (I, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, fold change â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 1.8</NUMEX>, average difference change â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 50</NUMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> (present) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> measurement). 'Directional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX>' was also imposed on the two comparison files.
        Directional consistency means that the direction or sign of
        a change is the same in both comparisons. Adding the
        additional replicates and using these filter criteria
        yielded only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,529</NUMEX>), indicating a very low
        false-positive rate with only moderately stringent
        selection criteria, again consistent with what we usually
        observe [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 12, 13</ENAMEX>].
        Once analysis criteria and an estimate of the
        false-positive rate had been established, it was possible
        to confidently assess differences in the gene-expression
        patterns between the cerebellum and the amygdala. Pairwise
        comparisons between cerebellum (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cb1 and Cb2</TIMEX>) and amygdala
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ag1 and Ag2</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX>(for example,
        Cb1 vs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ag1 and Cb2</TIMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag2</ENAMEX>). Both of these comparisons were
        loaded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and filtered using the criteria that
        yielded the very low false-positive rate (I, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, D, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>,
        fold change â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 1.8</NUMEX>, average difference change â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 50</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> measurement). An analysis of the
        cerebellum-amygdala comparisons with these criteria yielded
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. In the list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX>
        genes, cerebellum-specific genes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purkinje</ENAMEX> cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-D-aspartate</ENAMEX> (NMDA) receptor
        NR2C <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>, were identified as being specifically
        expressed in the cerebellum and not the amygdala,
        consistent with expectations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. On the basis of
        careful analysis of independent replicates, a high
        percentage of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are likely to be correctly
        identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed. Therefore, Bullfrog
        provides the bench <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> with a way to quickly
        identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes for further
        analysis and follow-up.
      
      
        Manipulating data sets in Spot
        Many of the features available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> for
        oligonucleotide arrays are available in Spot for cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. To illustrate the specific capabilities of Spot, we
        use experimental data from a time-course study of wild-type
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mouse thymus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.J. Winrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.G.P.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.T. Vibat</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.J. Bowen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.A. Callahan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.J.L.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.J. Warren</ENAMEX>, B.S.
        Hilbush, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Wynshaw-Boris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.W. Hasel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. Weaver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished observations). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> typically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acquire T-cell</ENAMEX> lymphomas at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3-4 months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The cDNA
        array experiment compared gene expression in the thymus of
        the mutant and wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different times (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks, 5 weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 weeks</TIMEX>).
        As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> experiments, cDNA microarray
        experiments require meaningful independent replicates to
        determine the false-positive rate and to confidently
        identify genes that are differentially expressed. It is
        recommended, when performing cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments
        with the standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fluorophore co-hybridization
        reactions, that all experiments and replicates be performed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fluorophore-</TIMEX>reversed pairs. Reversal of fluorescent
        labeling, in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to be compared are
        labeled once with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fluorophore and once with the other,
        helps compensate for differential incorporation of the
        fluorescent dyes and other sources of fluorophore-related
        systematic errors or bias [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Newer labeling strategies,
        such as amino<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-allyl</ENAMEX>-based labeling, reduce some of the bias
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with differential fluorophore incorporation, but
        it is still important to use fluorophore reversal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. Fluorophore reversal results in two measurements for
        each pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, a forward measurement (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fluorophore 1</ENAMEX>
        = experimental sample, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fluorophore 2</TIMEX> = control sample) and
        a reverse measurement (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fluorophore 1</TIMEX> = control sample,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fluorophore 2</TIMEX> = experimental sample).
        To estimate the false-positive rate for the cDNA
        experiment described above, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from two
        independent thymuses from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 16 weeks</TIMEX>
        were compared, using fluorophore reversal replicates. The
        array data were background subtracted, normalized and
        analyzed with the custom cDNA normalization program
        described below. The forward measurement file was loaded
        into Spot together with the reverse measurement file (saved
        from the custom cDNA normalization program). Application of
        the standard filter criteria (a difference call of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, MI</ENAMEX>, D
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, fold change = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>; signal change = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> in both files,
        after scaling to a mean signal, or target value, across the
        entire array of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, an absolute call of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, and directional consistency) yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene
        scored as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,608</NUMEX>. To
        increase sensitivity, the fold-change threshold was
        decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> and the scaled signal change cut-off to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>. This more sensitive filter yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,608</NUMEX>, indicating a low and satisfactory false-positive
        rate.
        Once the false-positive rate had been estimated, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-course comparisons were filtered for differences
        between mutant and wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. For this cDNA microarray
        experiment, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX>-point comparisons of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> to wild-type mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymus</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 weeks</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 weeks</ENAMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 weeks</TIMEX>). First, we looked for differentially expressed
        genes (wild type vs mutant) at each individual time point.
        Using the criteria established above, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found
        to be significantly different at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. None of these
        genes was common to all time points. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        were common to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- and 5-week</TIMEX> time points, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 8 weeks</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to apply the
        filtering criteria to a subset of the loaded files (done by
        checking the 'Filter?' <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box</ENAMEX> for the relevant files only).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot display the results for all loaded files,
        but the filter criteria are only applied to checked files.
        It is often useful to filter using only a subset of the
        files, while viewing the results across all the files. For
        example, in the time-course experiment, it is possible to
        identify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were differentially expressed in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time point, while also monitoring how those same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> behaved in the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> time points. Using this
        feature, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes were found that were
        directionally consistent for all time points, but were
        slightly below at least some of the thresholds for some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points. Similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullfrog</ENAMEX>, Spot quickly identified a
        list of differentially expressed genes for further analysis
        and follow-up. To determine all this information, including
        estimating the false-positive rate and testing the
        selection criteria, required less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Further features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot
        
          Double-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tiered</ENAMEX> filters
          In addition to the commonly used filters described
          above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot have several double-tiered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filters</ENAMEX> (located on the right in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An example of
          their use is to select genes that are differentially
          expressed with a fold change greater than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.3</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> files AND with a larger fold change of greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> files.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spot</ENAMEX> also contain a simple logical Venn
          function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venn</ENAMEX> function (taken from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Venn diagrams</NUMEX>)
          allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> or spots to be
          compared to find common occurrences within the lists. The
          Venn function lets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> quickly identify the genes in
          common between lists generated from different
          measurements or using different filtering criteria. In
          addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to save the
          results of a filtering operation and reload them for
          further filtering.
        
        
          Attaching gene information
          Once a filtered list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been generated, gene
          information can be attached to the list. This information
          can include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> numbers
          with direct hyperlinks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene Resources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Locus</ENAMEX> Link
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX>, gene names, gene descriptions, BLAST hits, protein
          products, functions, chromosomal locations and known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with particular phenotypes. The gene
          information is stored in tables created in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> and must contain these columns (comma separated) in
          the following order: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set or spot identifier,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> number, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene ID</ENAMEX>, gene title, and map
          location. Additional information may be added past these
          columns. To append gene information to a filtered list in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> or Spot, the browse button next to the 'Enter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Probe Set Description From File:</ENAMEX>' statement at the bottom
          of the filter criteria table is pressed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can choose to show or hide gene information by
          pressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'Show Probe Set Description</ENAMEX>' button. Gene
          lists for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Mu11KsubA</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mu11KsubB</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hu6800</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG-U74av2</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-U95av2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RG-U34a</ENAMEX> Affymetrix chips are available for
          download as additional data files with this article or
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exporting</ENAMEX> results
          Genes (spots or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>) that pass the set filter
          criteria are listed in a simple table format that can be
          exported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). To export the entire
          filtered table with all the information present,
          including gene information, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'Save Table To Excel</ENAMEX>'
          button is pressed. To export a more refined list, check
          boxes are provided. For example, if only the fold change
          and average difference values are needed, the pertinent
          boxes are checked and the 'Save As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Series To Excel</ENAMEX>'
          button is pressed. To export a simple list of the probe
          sets that passed certain filter criteria, without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> information, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Save List To Excel</ENAMEX>' button
          is pressed. This exported data can be analyzed further in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> and visualization programs. In our experience,
          it is often helpful to pre-filter data sets using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot before hierarchical or k-means
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Program architecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot are Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>+ client
        applications running on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows NT</ENAMEX> operating systems. They
        are written using a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTML</ENAMEX> and Scripting
        code (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBScript</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JScript</ENAMEX>). They are relatively small
        programs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MB and 1.2 MB</ENAMEX> respectively, and are easy to
        install. Double clicking the setup.bat module registers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot onto the hard drive.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++</ENAMEX> module (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlprov</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dll</ENAMEX>) performs the
        computationally intensive functions such as parsing and
        filtering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> or cDNA data files. This module
        makes the data files accessible as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft OLE-DB</ENAMEX> data
        source, allowing script code to communicate through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Objects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADO</ENAMEX>) interface.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlprov</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dll</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++ Windows Dynamic Link Library</ENAMEX> developed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Visual Studio 6.0</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADO Interface</ENAMEX> uses the Active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Template Library</ENAMEX> (ATL) to implement the appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Component Object Model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">COM</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interfaces</ENAMEX>, as provided by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Visual Studio Wizard</ENAMEX> for creating an OLE-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DB</ENAMEX> data

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX> and Spot.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX> modules have scripting
        code that uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADO interface</ENAMEX> to query the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++</ENAMEX> module as
        if it were a database. These modules are a combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">static HTML</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBScript</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JScript</ENAMEX> that produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HTML</ENAMEX> on the
        fly (DHTML) and use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ADO commands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recordsets</ENAMEX>. They were
        developed and debugged using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visual InterDev</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visual Studio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NET</ENAMEX>. The static <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTML</ENAMEX> provides a simple
        and familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> for loading files and choosing
        filtering options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> has scripts to
        dynamically create and modify the page's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTML</ENAMEX> (DHTML), such
        as occurs when displaying a results table.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfrog</ENAMEX> and Spot require that data from experiments be
        saved as specific file types before loading. Bullfrog
        requires that the data from .chp comparison files be saved
        as .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">txt</ENAMEX> files (tab-delimited text, refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s
        manual for complete instructions). Spot requires that data
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> summary files, discussed below, be saved as
        .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">csv</ENAMEX> files (comma-separated text). These files can then be
        loaded into their respective programs for analysis by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">clicking the 'Add Text File</ENAMEX>' button (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Prompt For File Auto Load</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> is checked, the program
        will automatically import <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 200</NUMEX> files from the same
        directory or folder. Once the files are loaded, clicking
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'Complete Summary Table</ENAMEX>' button displays relevant

        Features and architecture of the cDNA normalization
        program
        The custom cDNA normalization program is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
        Excel macro and was written in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Visual Basic</ENAMEX> for
        Applications (VBA) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Visual Basic Editor</ENAMEX>.
        The program background subtracts and normalizes raw cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> before data analysis and filtering in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spot</ENAMEX>. The
        normalization program output includes quantitative
        information and qualitative calls similar to those used for
        Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Raw median pixel
        intensities for each gene are loaded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>.
        Median pixel intensities are used because they are less
        likely to be affected by small artifacts or slight
        imperfections in spot morphology. The regional background
        is calculated by dividing the cDNA array into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> equal
        sections, and the average of the lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of spot
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> in a section is considered the section
        background (a section typically contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384 to 418</NUMEX> spots).
        The background signal is the result of nonspecific
        hybridization, binding of the fluorophores to the glass
        surface, and fluorescence and reflection from the surface
        of the cDNA array. The lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of spots (typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-17</NUMEX>
        spots) was chosen as a balance between using multiple spots
        at different locations that accurately reflect nonspecific
        signals and not including too many spots that contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'real</ENAMEX>' signals. A separate background value is calculated
        for each section to help correct for background that may be
        uneven. The background is subtracted from each spot in a
        particular section before further scaling or processing of
        quantitative results. For more information on background
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtraction</ENAMEX>, please review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salk</ENAMEX> cDNA analysis algorithm
        guide in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s manual folder, available with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">online</ENAMEX> version of this article or at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        After background subtraction, the cDNA array signals are
        linearly scaled and normalized to compensate for
        non-biological variation (for example, differential
        fluorophore incorporation, different amounts of labeled
        sample, array-to-array variability). Background-subtracted
        signals are scaled to an overall, average target value that
        can be set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> (the default value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>). The
        scaling factor is calculated on the basis of the total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity, after ignoring the lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> and the
        highest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of signals. We determined empirically, by
        analyzing large amounts of cDNA array data and testing
        different combinations of high and low exclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">percentages</ENAMEX>, that ignoring the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> and top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of
        signals led to scaling factors that were consistent and
        well behaved (for example, the mean and median of the
        resulting distributions were approximately equal). More
        important, scaling factors calculated in this way
        consistently resulted in the smallest number of genes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'differentially</ENAMEX> expressed' between replicates.
        To identify scaled signals that are detectable above
        background and to accurately estimate fold changes
        (ratios), a threshold is set using the scaled background
        values. Scaled signals that are less than the threshold are
        considered undetectable and are set equal to the threshold
        value. For more information on scaling and the setting of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thresholds</ENAMEX> please review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salk</ENAMEX> cDNA analysis
        algorithm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s manual folder, available with
        the online version of this article or at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        The custom cDNA normalization program generates a file
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> that provides a single printable summary
        sheet for each experiment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The file includes
        information on the cDNA array background, the raw average
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity, the scaling factors, the thresholds, the
        percentage of genes scored as present, the number of genes
        with fold changes (ratios) above certain thresholds and
        several correlation coefficients. This file provides an
        assessment of the overall quality of the data and a summary
        of the experimental results for each cDNA array. At the top
        of the summary file, not shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, are several
        user-entered parameters that define the experiment. If
        controls were spotted on the cDNA array, a control summary
        is also created. In addition to the data summary, the
        detailed results for each spot on the microarray are
        provided in a table for further analysis with Spot or other
        programs. The results for each spot (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>) include an
        absolute call of present (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) or absent (A) (a call of
        present indicates that the signal was greater than the
        regional background AND greater than the local background
        measured in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> surrounding the individual
        spot), the scaled intensity, the difference between the
        scaled fluorophore intensities, the fold change or ratio of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color intensities (expression ratio), and a
        qualitative difference or change call of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, MI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>
        (change calls are based on the fold changes across the
        duplicate spot data). The spot-by-spot results are easily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exportable</ENAMEX> to other programs for further visualization or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>. Once the cDNA data are normalized and in a
        systematic format similar to the normalized Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, the data are ready for further analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spot</ENAMEX>. To

        Overall assessment
        By creating an intuitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>,
        adjustable filter criteria, we have established valuable
        research tools for microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Bullfrog, Spot and the
        custom cDNA normalization program were not designed to do
        complex statistical analyses and visualization. Rather,
        they were designed to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> narrow their
        search from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hundred</ENAMEX> or fewer that meet specific, but adjustable,
        criteria. Bullfrog, Spot and the custom cDNA normalization
        program eliminate some of the difficulty of handling large
        numbers of array results and allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to answer
        crucial questions about their data quickly. These programs,
        along with detailed instructions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> manuals, may be
        downloaded at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
