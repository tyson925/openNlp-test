        Opioid ligands exhibit a variety of physiological
        activities and have been utilized extensively in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,
        most prominently in the treatment of pain. However, at
        analgesic doses, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptor agonists</ENAMEX> or partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> can induce unwanted side effects such as
        ventilatory depression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] and the development of
        physical tolerance and dependence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the
        search for opioid ligands which possess analgesic effect
        and lack untoward effects has been a sought after goal of
        the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The overall hypothesis that drives
        the present work is that the ideal opioid analgesics that
        exhibit minimal side effects might be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that bind to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor, but differentially activate
        each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor types <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Î¼, Î´, Îº</ENAMEX>). Such drugs
        would potentially act as a full agonist at a specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor type, while acting as partial agonists or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> at the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> types. For example some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have suggested that opioid ligands with
        agonism at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> and antagonism at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are potentially useful analgesics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . In
        cases where the medicinal effect of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is mediated
        through the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor type that also elicits the
        side effects, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with mixed activity could be
        most beneficial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In such a case, interaction with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> could reverse the unwanted side effects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with activation of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. In order
        to test this hypothesis, the activation profiles of a set
        of non-selective opioid ligands need to be assessed 
        in vitro , followed by 
        in vivo evaluation of analgesic and
        unwanted effects. The completed data set can be used to
        determine the characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ligands</ENAMEX> possessing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analgesia</ENAMEX> in the absence of unwanted effects. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
        steps in such an approach is presented here.
        In order to clearly understand the activity of any
        ligand for mechanistic characterization or rational drug
        design, it is essential that the ligands be tested in a
        well-defined environment under identical experimental
        conditions. Moreover, the use of a transfected cell system
        in which a single receptor type is expressed is critical
        for these types of modelling. Such tools were not available
        until recently when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX>. We have previously characterized these ligands in
        cells expressing only Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The present
        study was devised to characterize the activity of a set of
        opioid ligands in a cell line expressing only Î¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The ligands selected were chosen based on our
        previous data suggesting that they bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> opioid
        receptor types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Previous model tissue data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        and 
        in vivo data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] had suggested
        that some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> displayed differential activation
        profiles at each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor types. Thus, the
        present study was designed to achieve the following goals;
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid
        ligands not previously defined in an isolated cell system
        expressing only Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to compare the
        efficacies of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to the known, highly efficacious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼ receptor agonist</ENAMEX>, fentanyl, the common opioid analgesic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX> and to the endogenous opioid ligand
        Î²-endorphin.
        In the present study, we employed an HEK cell line
        stably <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">expressing Î¼ opioid receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK-Î¼</ENAMEX>) to
        characterize the activation and binding profiles of fifteen
        opioid ligands. These cells do not express endogenous Î¼
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and are easily transfected. Furthermore,
        they have previously been used to study <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] by measuring inhibition of
        forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The results obtained
        from this study can serve to clarify the categorization of
        each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied as an agonist, weak/partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> or antagonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. Moreover,
        these results demonstrate that it is crucial to understand
        the interaction of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> with a single receptor type at
        the molecular level in order to fully appreciate the mode
        of action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Activation assays
          Our results clearly characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied
          as agonists or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> with
          respect to inhibition of adenyly cyclase. Naltrexone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10047</NUMEX> and WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX> were identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>.
          These ligands exhibited little or no measurable
          inhibitory effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP production
          when used alone and were repeatedly able to block the
          inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM etorphine. All other ligands
          studied showed agonism at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor with varying
          maximal effects or efficacies ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29% - 71%</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The rank order of efficacy of the ligands
          tested were fentanyl = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydromorphone</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-endorphin</NUMEX> >
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etorphine</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lofentanil</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butorphanol</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphine</ENAMEX>=
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nalbuphine</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nalorphine</ENAMEX> > <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclazocine</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dezocine</ENAMEX> =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metazocine â‰¥ xorphanol</ENAMEX>. The IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied were between
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-10 nM</TIMEX>, with the exception of etorphine, which was the
          most potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, with an IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> nM, morphine, which was the
          least potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> with an IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nM and the endogenous ligand
          Î²-endorphin with IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nM. A low affinity is
          acceptable for an endogenous ligand that is released at
          very high concentrations at the site of action at the
          synaptic cleft. The rank order of potency of the drugs
          studied were; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">></ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">xorphanol</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nalorphine</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butorphanol</ENAMEX> = lofentanil
          > <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine</ENAMEX> >
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fentanyl > morphine >>>> Î²-endorphin.</ENAMEX> As
          can be seen, the rank order of efficacy was not related
          to the rank order of potency. In fact one of the most
          potent ligands, xorphanol, was the least efficacious.
          Statistical analysis of the differences between the
          efficacies of different ligands was carried out to
          distinguish the full agonists from the partial agonists.
          Based on these analyses, there was no difference in the
          efficacy of butorphanol, etorphine, lofentanil or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nalorphine</ENAMEX> compared to fentanyl or hydromorphone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). However, morphine and nalbuphine both had
          efficacies that were less than fentanyl (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
          Both fentanyl and hydromorphone showed maximal efficacies
          that were not significantly different compared to that of
          the endogenous ligand <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-endorphin</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>), thus
          categorizing them as full agonists compared to
          Î²-endorphin. Finally the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> weakest agonists,
          cyclazocine, dezocine, metazocine and xorphanol all
          exhibited efficacies that showed statistically
          significant difference when compared to fentanyl (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>), and thus were categorized as partial agonists.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1represents</NUMEX> the dose response curves of three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> antagonist. The least efficacious
          (xorphanol, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1a</ENAMEX>) and most efficacious (fentanyl, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          1b) ligands are shown for comparison. The dose response
          curve of nalbuphine that was previously described as an
          antagonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptor</ENAMEX> is also shown (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1c</ENAMEX>) in
          order to demonstrate the robustness of its agonistic
          effect at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptor</ENAMEX>. Finally, a dose response
          curve of naltrexone as it fully blocked the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          nM etorphine is shown (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1d</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Binding assays
          A single clone of transfected HEK cells stably
          expressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3</NUMEX> pmoles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>
          per mg of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, as measured by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DAMGO binding,
          was propagated and used as a model for characterization
          of the binding profiles of a set of opioid ligands at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼
          opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. This level of expression is not
          uncommon for transfected cell systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] ,
          although such receptor expression levels may appear
          higher than reported values from brain tissues. The
          measured values from specific brain regions are average
          estimates over an entire tissue or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and not that of
          a single cell and the actual expression on a single cell
          in the brain is most likely much higher. Furthermore,
          these high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> expression have been
          measured in cell lines that were established from various
          neuronal tissues. For example, similar levels of
          expression have been measured for neuronal cells in
          culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] or primary cultures of
          dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼</ENAMEX> receptor expression in the cell line used in
          this study is comparable to that of cells expressing the
          Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> in various regions of the nervous
          system. Competition binding studies were carried out for
          the ligands that were shown to act as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> or
          weak/partial agonists at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> to confirm
          that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were in fact capable of binding to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼
          opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with high affinity. Competition binding
          studies indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists naltrexone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10047</NUMEX> and WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX> had binding affinities (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i ) in nanomolar range and the two
          weakest agonists, xorphanol and cyclazocine bound the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> with the highest affinities. The rank order of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX> was determined to be; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclazocine</ENAMEX> = xorphanol
          > WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX> > naltrexone > <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10047</NUMEX> >
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX>. This order was in agreement with the relative
          potencies of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, showing that cyclazocine and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xorphanol</ENAMEX> had higher affinities and potencies compared to
          morphine, although they were both less efficacious than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A well-defined receptor expression system was used to
        characterize the activation profiles of a set of opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> and to compare the efficacies and potencies of
        these ligands at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. The main advantage of
        using transfected HEK cells for this study is that these
        cells do not contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous Î¼ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express the G</ENAMEX> proteins necessary for the proper coupling of
        the transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to the respective <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> messenger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. A well established method for assessing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein
        activation by opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and characterizing activity
        of opioid ligands is measuring the extent of inhibition of
        forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>) activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in
        playing a role in mediating the analgesic effect of opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> through Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        Thus, characterizing the ability of opioid ligands to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibit</ENAMEX> cAMP production, such as described in this report,
        could be used as an index for assessing their activity as a
        correlate of their analgesic effects. Moreover, a simple
        well-defined system, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used in this study,
        can be very beneficial in describing the mode of action of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> at a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. However, it is
        understood that once applied to the whole animal 
        in vivo , the overall effect of the
        drug will be a composite of the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> on all
        receptor types interacting with it. Furthermore, the
        pharmacokinetic parameters, such as metabolism, tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> and distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> will play a major
        role in the overall drug effect 
        in vivo. 
        The present set of ligands exhibited a range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacies</ENAMEX> and potencies. The most efficacious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was
        fentanyl, supporting previous 
        in vivo studies describing fentanyl
        as a highly potent and efficacious analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        On the other hand xorphanol was identified as a highly
        potent ligand with the lowest efficacy in inhibiting cAMP
        production through Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clinically,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xorphanol</ENAMEX> is a well tolerated, orally active analgesic that
        provides effective pain relief but shows low physical
        dependence liability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . It is possible that the
        low physical dependence liability of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is due to
        its partial agonism at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>.
        The present study can offer some explanation for the
        existing 
        in vivo data by providing information
        on the relative coupling efficacies of the tested ligands
        from a controlled system. For example, one study
        characterizing butorphanol, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] described this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> as a
        mild analgesic compared to morphine. However, in another
        study, butorphanol was reported to be equipotent in its
        antinociceptive effect to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In our
        assays, we have observed that butorphanol and morphine are
        equally efficacious in inhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> production, although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">butorphanol</ENAMEX> is more potent than morphine in this assay.
        Based on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of results, if the analgesic effect
        of butorphanol is mediated via Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> through
        the inhibitory effect of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on adenylyl
        cyclase, the equal efficacy of morphine and butorphanol
        would support an equal antinociceptive effect of these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Thus, such results demonstrate that it is essential
        to describe the effect of ligands on specific receptor
        types in order to fully define the mode of action of each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        Our data clearly show that nalbuphine is a potent
        agonist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼ opioid</ENAMEX> receptor with an efficacy similar
        to that of morphine, thus agreeing with 
        in vivo data showing that morphine
        and nalbuphine are equally potent as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analgesics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        However, other reports have described nalbuphine as a
        "mixed agonist/antagonist" with agonism at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>º opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and antagonism at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> based on 
        in vivo data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 33</NUMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorization</ENAMEX> is likely due to the fact that nalbuphine
        has been shown to reduce the ventilatory depressant effect
        of other opioids, while adding to their analgesic effect [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nalbuphine</ENAMEX> is also used clinically to reduce the
        opioid-mediated side effects such as itching, without
        completely reversing the analgesic effects of the full
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . According to our data, although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nalbuphine</ENAMEX> is clearly a potent agonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, its
        levels of agonism is significantly lower than the very
        efficacious drug fentanyl and the endogenous ligand
        Î²-endorphin. Therefore, if combined with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> such as
        fentanyl, or in the presence of an internal pool of
        Î²-endorphin, nalbuphine can act as an antagonist in
        inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        the net effect of the mixture of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> at the
        level of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> will be the combined effect. This
        can explain the usefulness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as nalbuphine in
        reducing the side effects associated with the more potent
        opioid analgesics while not totally reversing the analgesic
        action of those ligands.
        Comparing the efficacies of the ligands in this study to
        the endogenous ligand Î²-endorphin indicates that fentanyl,
        etorphine, lofentanil, butorphanol and hydromorphone are
        all full agonists. Thus in physiological pathways where
        inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediates the activity of Î¼
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> will act as agonists at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Other ligands with efficacies
        significantly different from that of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-endorphin</NUMEX>, can act
        as agonists with different efficacies at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>
        when administered alone. However, in the presence of the
        endogenous ligand <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-endorphin</NUMEX> (when released at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synapse</ENAMEX>) or another full agonist, a weaker agonist can
        potentially act as a competitive antagonist. Conversely, it
        is possible for ligands categorized and accepted as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> to act as agonists at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor, if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> alone at high enough concentrations, albeit with a
        very low efficacy. This does not mean that when applied to
        the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, an analgesic effect of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> will
        be observed. The reason is that the affinity, efficacy,
        dose and pharmacokinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> used will
        influence the ultimate effect seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, as will
        the presence of other ligands in the system. When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are
        used in combination, the net effect will depend on the
        intrinsic characteristics (efficacy and affinity) of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> relative to each other and their relative
        concentrations at the site of action. Consequently, it is
        important to have a clear understanding of the
        characteristics of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and the molecular changes that
        occur at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interaction</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . Such knowledge will allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to target a specific
        receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with the aim of attaining a certain
        physiological effect; possibly by mixing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more drugs
        or using a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that possesses different activation
        profiles at various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, this is the first detailed comparative
        report of the inhibitory effect of a set of opioid ligands
        on the accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> in intact cells expressing Î¼
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The activation profiles of these ligands
        have been compared to that of the endogenous opioid ligand,
        Î²-endorphin, and the commonly used opioid analgesics,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX> and fentanyl. Moreover, this report serves to
        clarify the activation profiles of many previously
        uncharacterised ligands in cells expressing only Î¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, thus leading to a better understanding of the
        mechanism of action of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.

          Stably transfected HEK cells were developed as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells were
          transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse Î¼</ENAMEX> opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cDNA</ENAMEX> in the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies, Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> clone with a B 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3326 Â± 674 fmoles/mg</ENAMEX> of protein
          as assessed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DAMGO binding was propagated for use
          in this study.
        
        
          Binding assays
          Saturation binding assays were carried out for [
          3H]-DAMGO in HEK cells as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> was carried out in triplicates in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          total reaction volume containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-25 Î¼g</NUMEX> of crude cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenate</ENAMEX> per assay tube. Incubation was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> mM Tris
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> at room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. The
          assay was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GF</ENAMEX>/B filters followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> washes, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold
          buffer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radioactivity</ENAMEX> retained on the filters was
          measured using liquid scintillation counting.
          Competition binding assays were carried out in crude
          homogenate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEK-Î¼ cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding</ENAMEX> was carried out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>
          Î¼l volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAMGO</ENAMEX> and increasing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-32</NUMEX>) of unlabeled ligand. Incubation
          and washing were as described above. Binding data were
          analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affinity Analysis Software</ENAMEX> as
          described before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . For preparation of crude cell
          homogenate, confluent cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEK-Î¼ cells</ENAMEX> were
          harvested using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate buffered saline</ENAMEX>. Following
          centrifugation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell pellet</ENAMEX> was resuspended in
          ice-cold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7cell/ml</ENAMEX>, and homogenized using a polytron at setting 6
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 seconds</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell homogenate</ENAMEX> was stored in
          aliquots at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-86Â°C until</TIMEX> use. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> content of the cell
          homogenate was determined using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bio-Rad protein</ENAMEX> assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Whole cell adenylyl cyclase assays
          Exponentially growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEK-Î¼ cells</ENAMEX> were harvested and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in serum free <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DMEM/F12</ENAMEX> medium. Cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well micro titer plates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          4cells/well. To each well, phosphodiesterase inhibitor
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine</TIMEX> (IBMX) was added to a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX>, followed by addition of agonists
          at different concentrations and incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Following incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>, forskolin was added
          to each well to a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M followed by
          another incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. The reaction
          was terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition
          of lysis buffer from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Biotrakâ„¢ cAMP Enzyme</ENAMEX> Immunoassay
          kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckinghamshire</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>). The rest of the assay followed the protocol
          provided with the kit. Actual amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> was
          determined for each sample in comparison to a standard
          curve of known amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> kit,
          as described in the kit protocol.
        
        
          Agonism
          Agonistic activity of opioid ligands was assessed by
          measuring the inhibitory effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on
          forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the top of the curve (no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>),
          expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> inhibition of forskolin-stimulated
          cAMP accumulation and were fitted to a sigmoidal function
          by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site competition function as described
          below. The efficacy of each ligand was defined as percent
          inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production
          compared to no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> levels (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> inhibition, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> cAMP
          production).
        
        
          Antagonism
          Compounds with no or very small 
          in vitro agonistic activity
          (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> inhibition of cAMP production) for which the
          dose response curves could not be fitted due to the small
          effect, were tested for antagonism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Antagonists</ENAMEX> were
          defined as ligands that were able to repeatedly block the
          inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM etorphine on
          forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Antagonist was
          added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> of
          incubation, the agonist was added and the cells were
          incubated with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 10 minutes</TIMEX>.
          The rest of the assay was as described above.
        
        
          Curve fitting
          The analysis of drug activity was performed using
          PRISM software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GraphPad Software, Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA). A
          computer-generated "best fit" of non-linear regression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> was used to provide an estimate of the inhibitory
          concentration at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ). Dose response data generated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system were fitted to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site competition function.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> processing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from each dose response curve were normalized to
          the top of the respective curve. The normalized data from
          multiple dose response curves were combined and a new
          dose response curve was fitted to the combined data and
          the IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> and maximal inhibition were
          determined for the combined data.
