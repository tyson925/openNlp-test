        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> is the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (excluding
        non-malignant skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">melanomas</ENAMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> leading cause
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> deaths among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . During the
        1990s, the observed incidence of female breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
        increased, and was accompanied by a significant decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Both trends may be due, in
        part, to the increased utilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammography</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1989 to 1997</TIMEX>, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged = 40 years
        who reported "ever had a mammogram" increased from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.9%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.8%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . However, there was a substantial difference
        between those who were ever screened and the proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> screened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 2 years</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.8%</NUMEX> v. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.3%</NUMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>]) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Relative to areas of higher population density, areas of
        lower population density have been noted to have increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> incidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were also less likely than their urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> to have received a mammogram [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . This
        difference was attributable to disparities in education
        level, household income, and health insurance coverage.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were also less likely than urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to have
        a recent mammogram or clinical breast exam (CBE) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Conversely, a recent qualitative study reported that rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had higher rates of mammography and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBE</ENAMEX> than their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> and suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Providers of primary care services play a critical role
        in determining patient compliance with preventive services
        through direct recommendations to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who were "off schedule" for regular mammograms
        were significantly less likely to have a regular physician
        and to have received a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> recommendation for a
        mammogram than "on schedule" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Another study
        of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and general internists showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who received a provider referral completed a
        screening mammography within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 18%</NUMEX> of
        self-referred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> report
        that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s recommendation to have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        screening is "important" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> survey of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician attitudes</ENAMEX> and practices in early cancer
        detection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> reported that screening guidelines
        influenced their referrals for mammograms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . It
        should be noted that multiple factors contribute to
        clinician compliance with guidelines including:
        provider-related, guideline-related, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-related, and
        environment-related variables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Our study examined
        geographic location of practice to identify any variations
        in approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening among clinicians
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician assistants</ENAMEX>)
        in primary care settings.
      
      
        Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> surveys examining issue of cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> and control were mailed to primary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> assistants
        (n = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1761</TIMEX>) in an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> region of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
        Primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> included family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, general internists, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">obstetricians/gynaecologists.</ENAMEX> Mailing addresses were
        obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> directories of a major regional
        health maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (HMO), supplemented with
        mailing lists from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nurse Practitioner Association of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western New York</ENAMEX> (NPWNY), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western New York</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physician Assistants' Association</ENAMEX> (WNYPAA). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western New</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX> ranks among the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US for Health</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maintenance Organization</ENAMEX> (HMO) penetrance. For this reason,
        essentially all primary care providers are included in HMO
        practitioner mailing lists (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>-confirm this figure).
        An initial mailing to primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and
        non-physician <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX> and physician
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assistants</ENAMEX>) was performed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, followed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        additional mailings to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-week</TIMEX> intervals.
        The first follow up mailing was the same as the initial
        mailing and included an additional copy of the
        questionnaire. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> mailing was a postcard reminding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> to return their surveys.
        The survey consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> items eliciting information
        on clinician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours
        concerning the delivery of general preventive and cancer
        screening services, as well as personal and professional
        demographic information. The survey was pre-tested for
        content validity using a convenience sample of health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX>.
        Responses to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> multiple-choice items were used to
        examine variation in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening practices:
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. At what age should an average-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> initiate screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> using clinical
        breast examination? [accepted answer: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        .
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. At what age should an average-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> get a baseline mammogram? [accepted answer: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>]. No current guidelines address this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX>, although
        it was a prior recommendation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX>, it is not addressed
        in their current guidelines.
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. At what age should an average-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> begin having mammograms every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>? [accepted answer: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        .
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. At what age should an average-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> mammograms? [accepted answer: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Since no single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has issued breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        screening guidelines, which address all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        screening items, we relied upon guidelines issued by
        several different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Family Physicians</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20</NUMEX> ] and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndUnited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Preventive Services Task Force</ENAMEX> (USPSTF) advise
        mammography every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2 years for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-69 years</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] . (Since completion of data collection for this project,
        the 3rd <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USPSTF</ENAMEX> released an updated statement advising
        mammography, with or without clinical breast examination,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 1-2 years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> and older [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        ).
        A summary index of beliefs about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening
        was created by summing the total number of responses in
        agreement with these items; values for this summary
        variable ranged between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. It is important to
        emphasize that the focus is not on "correct" versus
        "incorrect" responses, but rather the variations among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. For example, if a large proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> indicate the same response to an item(s) this
        would indicate limited variation.
        Demographic information collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        included clinician age, gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity,
        professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, board certification, specialty,
        practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, work schedule, involvement with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX> of trainees, and the zip code location of their
        clinical practice.
        Using <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> figures and
        geographic land area (in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square miles</NUMEX>), the population
        density of each zip code area in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> was
        determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square mile</NUMEX>). Calculated population
        densities were matched with the clinical practice site zip
        codes provided by survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. Practice site zip
        codes were then divided into urban, rural, and suburban
        categories. The analysis is based on the location of each
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> and not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the clinician
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        All zip codes identified within the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNY</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffalo or Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> were categorized as "urban." Each
        of these urban areas had population densities exceeding
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square mile</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Communities
        surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> were identified as
        "suburban" if they were contiguous to these major cities
        and had population densities between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>/mile
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> zip code areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Counties</ENAMEX> had population densities exceeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">persons/mile 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> [1050.4/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Amherst</ENAMEX>
        [1068.5/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Tonawanda</ENAMEX> [1222.5/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tonawanda</ENAMEX>
        [3027.8/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Depew</ENAMEX> [3269.1/mile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]), they were
        classified as suburban areas for this study. These areas
        are distinctly separate from the urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, moreover
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have higher socio-economic status and are
        not burdened with the problems often associated with urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. Based on these changes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> clinicians were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reclassified</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%,17/428</NUMEX>).
        The remaining zip code areas were categorized as "rural"
        if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> density was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>/mile
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The majority of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are considered rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> (WNY) by local opinion. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> with total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> or more
        were classified as "suburban" consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Census</ENAMEX>
        criteria. This re-classification impacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredonia</ENAMEX> (total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">population 10706</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olean</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20976</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batavia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">22924</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8391</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockport</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">48859</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamestown</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">49478</ENAMEX>), and Lewiston
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">12104</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">##</NUMEX> of clinician were reclassified. Overall, this
        process resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> classified as urban,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> as suburban and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> as rural.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> statistics were used to compare demographic
        and professional characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> categories. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> analysis was also
        utilized to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between responses to breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening items with independent variables such as
        specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and demographic characteristics (age
        category, gender, etc.). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonparametric</ENAMEX> tests were used to
        evaluate differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> and the reported number of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of continuing medical education credits (CME) as
        these variables were not normally distributed. Odds ratios
        (with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals) were used to compare
        summary scores for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening and utilization
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening guidelines among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        within geographic categories. In addition, we used a
        multivariate logistic regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to test whether
        geographic category represented an independent predictor of
        the summary score for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening and use of
        written screening guidelines. Results are presented as
        adjusted odds ratios and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals. SPSS
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1</NUMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS, Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX>) was used for the
        analyses.
      
      
        Results
        Completed surveys were returned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">469</NUMEX> clinicians,
        yielding an overall response rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">469/1582</NUMEX>);
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> surveys could not be delivered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurse practitioners</ENAMEX> had
        a response rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199/424</NUMEX>), which was
        significantly greater than that of primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202/905</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician assistants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68/253</NUMEX>). Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">469</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were excluded from analysis:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> reporting their clinical practice site
        outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNY</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>);
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> reporting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than one year</TIMEX> in clinical
        practice (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>);
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> who did not self-identify as
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>"/"trainees", but reported that they were neither
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-eligible" nor "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-certified" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>);

        (n= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        Thus, analyses were based upon responses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">428</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">185</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician assistants</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        reported practicing in urban areas (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>), with a relatively
        equal distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> practicing in rural and
        suburban areas (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23% and 18%</NUMEX> respectively).
        As summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, the suburban and urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were more likely to be female. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> did
        not differ by age or race. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were more
        likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>), whereas a large proportion
        of both suburban and urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPs</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAs</ENAMEX>. Also, more rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-certified
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) compared to suburban and urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> respectively). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> were more likely to
        report being involved in the supervision of trainees (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>).
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician respondents</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> or general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> were more likely to be located in rural areas
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>).
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1summarizes</NUMEX> responses to each of the individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening questions. Agreement with "correct"
        responses ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% to 71%</NUMEX> for the individual items.
        Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> agreed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening items.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2presents</NUMEX> the distribution of scores for the
        summary index. While no significant differences were noted
        by practise location, variation is evident illustrating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in responses. As illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the
        distribution of summary index scores differed by clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.049</NUMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of clinician were compared
        separately, the distribution of scores differed only for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX>).
        Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> agreed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        or more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening items (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). There were significant differences between age tertiles
        with the <<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>) being more likely than
        the ><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>) to correctly answer 3 or
        more of these items. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) were more likely than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>) to correctly answer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or more</NUMEX> items (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). Differences were also observed when the summary
        index was analysed by practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30.4%</NUMEX>
        of solo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> agreeing with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> breast screening questions. There were no significant
        differences by geographic categories in the summary measure
        or when individual questions on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening
        recommendations were compared.
        As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported use of some written breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        screening guideline. Analysis of geographic variations in
        the reported use of written breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> guidelines, after
        adjusting for age and professional designation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>,
        nurse practitioner, physician <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>) revealed less use
        of guidelines in both suburban (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>) and urban areas (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>) when compared to rural areas.
      
      
        Discussion
        While there were significant sociodemographic and
        practice-related differences by geographic regions, no
        significant variations were observed in the summary breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening index among urban, suburban and rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. These results are important in highlighting
        differences in how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening is approached,
        with agreement ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% to 71%</NUMEX> for the individual
        breast screening items. Moreover, this group of primary
        care health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> demonstrates marked variation in
        approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening since agreement with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening statement
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 50%</NUMEX>. While this variation could be due to a
        variety of factors, it is more likely that these
        differences reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX>' attempts to reconcile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conflicting</ENAMEX> recommendations issued by various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
        We defined one "accepted" response to each item to serve
        as a basis from which to examine both dichotomous and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polychotomous</ENAMEX> responses. While others might debate which
        response category is "acceptable", the fact that responses
        are distributed across several categories is more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noteworthy</ENAMEX>. That is, regardless of the category selected,
        variation in responses is apparent. It is worth mentioning
        that the response option which we designated as the
        "accepted" answer was generally observed to represent the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modal</ENAMEX> response.
        While a potential limitation of this study is the low
        response rate (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>), it is comparable to the lower range of
        response rates of health care providers reported in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> article of this topic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Our study relied upon
        a passive response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> without any financial inducements
        for completing a multi-page mailed survey. The response
        rates among the geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> surveyed were
        similar.
        It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> working in non-primary
        care settings, and specialities with dual designations as
        "primary care providers" may have been less likely to
        complete the survey because it may have been perceived as
        outside their usual scope of practice. Also, the length of
        the survey may have contributed to a reduced number of
        responses. We were not able to more fully explore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sociodemographic</ENAMEX> and professional variations between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> due to limited baseline
        information beyond mailing addresses and practice location.
        While these limitations may impact the generalizability of
        our study, the comprehensive approach of including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPs</ENAMEX> in combination with the large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> represent unique strengths.
        The predominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> among urban and suburban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> may be due to the overrepresentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> were more
        likely to be involved in the supervision of trainees which
        is reflective of the locations of clinical training centers
        in urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. On the other hand,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> were more likely to report their specialty
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or general practice. This is consistent with a
        national trend of an increasing physician supply of family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians/</ENAMEX>general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] . Interestingly, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> were also more likely to
        be board-certified than their urban and suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. The
        overrepresentation of both family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> may account for this variation.
        Another issue which is not addressed by these data is
        what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> think about the guidelines. In other words,
        it is not clear if the clinicians do not follow the
        guidelines because they are not familiar with them, if they
        have reviewed the guidelines and don't agree with them, or
        if they simply find conflicting guidelines to be
        confusing.
        Guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening are not uniform
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Despite the recent recommendation
        from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rdUSPSTF</ENAMEX> advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammography</ENAMEX>, with or without
        clinical breast examination, every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2 years for women ages
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> and older [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , the issue of mammography among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40-49</TIMEX> remains under debate. The practice of
        obtaining a baseline mammogram, adopted by many primary
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in clinical practice, does not appear in
        the guidelines of any major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The source of
        these guidelines consulted for this paper and included the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>,
        specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and health insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study suggests that primary care clinicians,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse practitioners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assistants</ENAMEX>, lack a consistent approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        screening. This lack of agreement does not appear to be
        impacted by geographic practice location but rather is
        likely a more global clinical issue. The implications of
        this lack of consistency for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or groups
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are uncertain, since it is unclear how
        differences in approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening
        translate into differences in clinical practice.
        Application of an industrial perspective to reduce
        variation would suggest opportunities to develop a more
        consistent approach to how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening is
        addressed in the primary care setting. Development of an
        evidence-based, consensus statement regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, with broad endorsement, would support a single
        set of unambiguous guidelines for implementation across
        primary care settings.
