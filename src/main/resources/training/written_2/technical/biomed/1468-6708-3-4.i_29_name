        With the exception of counting deaths from all causes, a
        common problem in clinical trials is the missing data
        caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who do not complete the study in full
        schedule and drop out of the study without further
        measurements. Possible reasons for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> dropping out of
        the study (the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'withdrawals'</ENAMEX>) include death,
        adverse reactions, unpleasant study procedures, lack of
        improvement, early recovery, and other factors related or
        unrelated to trial procedure and treatments. Missing data
        in a study because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> may cause the usual
        statistical analysis for complete or available data to be
        subject to a potential bias. This review attempts to raise
        the awareness of the problem and to provide some general
        guidance to clinical trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Examples
        
          Example 1
          A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three
          parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> trial to compare placebo, candesartan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ciltexetil</ENAMEX> and enalapril in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mild to
          moderate essential hypertension [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The study
          randomized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> to treatment, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 178</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          were evaluable by protocol at the end of an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-week</ENAMEX>
          treatment period. 'The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were excluded
          from the analysis of blood pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX>) data because of
          major protocol violations, poor compliance with medical
          visits, or withdrawal because of adverse events.'
        
        
          Example 2
          A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-design
          study to compare the treatment effect of niacin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atorvastatin</ENAMEX> (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX>) on lipoprotein subfractions
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atherogenic dyslipidemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . 'Of the
          total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized to treatment, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> withdrew
          from the study. Of those who withdrew, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> were due to
          adverse events, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were lost to follow-up, and one did
          not return for the final visit.'
        
        
          Example 3
          A multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
          placebo-controlled trial to assess treatment effect of
          pimobendan on exercise capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . 'The primary pre-specified analysis
          of exercise time was limited to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had at
          least the first follow up (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-week</TIMEX>) exercise test
          carried out and had shown good compliance up to the day
          of the test. If subsequent tests were not performed,
          whatever the reason, or performed although compliance
          between tests had been poor, the last exercise time value
          obtained while compliance was good was carried forward.'
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two hundred</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">317</NUMEX> randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
          exercise test done with good compliance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>, and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX>. Listed reasons (and number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) for
          missing exercise time data at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX> were: 'exercise
          test not done due to death' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>), 'exercise testing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraindicated'</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), and 'exercise test not done for
          other reasons' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Example 4
          A randomized, double-blind study to compare
          nifedipine-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GITS</ENAMEX> and verapamil-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SR</ENAMEX> on hemodynamics, left
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventricular</ENAMEX> mass, and coronary vasodilatory in patients
          with advanced hypertension [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Fifty-four patients
          were randomized after the placebo run-in phase.
          'Twenty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> failed to complete the (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-month</TIMEX>) trial,
          and thus were not included for analysis because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          withdrawal for symptomatic adverse effects, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) lack of
          response, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) poor compliance.' 'Consequently, there
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with sufficient data sets for inclusion
          in analyses.'
        
        
          Example 5
          A randomized, double-blind, titration study of
          omapatrilat with hydrochlorothiazide in comparison with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrochlorothiazide</ENAMEX> (HCTZ) plus placebo for the treatment
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> of placebo lead in
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCTZ</ENAMEX> period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">274</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          randomized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. 'A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX>
          subjects completed the (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-week</TIMEX> double-blind period)
          study.'
        
      
      
        Effect of withdrawals on the data analysis
        To demonstrate with simple algebra the effects and key
        statistical concepts surrounding missing data, I use the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from Example <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> above. In that study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX>. However, only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who completed the
        trial were included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        excluded from the analysis the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        withdrew early because of adverse effects, lack of response
        or poor compliance. Defining effective control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> by the
        criteria of either maintaining diastolic blood pressure
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX>) ≤ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95 mmHg or achieving a least ≥ 15 mmHg</NUMEX> decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> summarized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> results: 'Eighty
        per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">randomized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> completed the protocol with
        effective control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> and no side effects.' Obviously,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> only counted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">completers</ENAMEX> and obtained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> and ignored the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        dropped out prior to the scheduled end of the study at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. To distinguish the different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this
        example, we denote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (cr)for the former and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)for the
        latter, that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>. It is easily seen that the
        correct summary should be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/54</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.4%</NUMEX> completed the
        protocol with effective control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> and no side effects,
        rather than the reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (cr)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/30</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>. (See Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.)
        If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> really intended to estimate the chance
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to have effective control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> with no side
        effects with the study therapies at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Month 6</TIMEX> ('responders'
        in brief), then we need to do more work. First, the
        calculation should always use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> as the denominator because
        that was the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized to the study;
        however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> measurement at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Month 6</TIMEX>; of
        them, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (cr)were responders. This means that the true
        answer should be (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)+?)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)) = (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>+?)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/54</NUMEX>, where
        the question mark represents the unknown number of
        responders among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)withdrawals counted in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">denominator</ENAMEX>. Next, we calculate the extreme possibilities
        as (a) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/54</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.4%</NUMEX> and (b) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/54</TIMEX> =
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48/54</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88.9%</NUMEX>.
        In (a) we assumed that none of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)withdrawals (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>)
        responded, while in (b) we assume all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)withdrawals
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) responded. Of course, we know that (b) is
        unrealistic since some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> withdrew because of lack of
        response and some because of side effects, but the paper
        did not provide the exact numbers. In general, we usually
        do not feel comfortable with either extreme, but we
        understand that they provide an idea of the uncertainty in
        the data because of withdrawals.
        An estimate between the extremes is (c): to substitute
        the unknown number by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d)×</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/30</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d)×</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.2</NUMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> (cr)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/30</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> is the proportion of
        responders among those who completed the trial. That is,
        when no particular information was available, we may assume
        that the same proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> would have also responded, had they completed
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>. Unsurprisingly, when we do the calculation, the
        estimate becomes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> (cr)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.2</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/54</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43.2/54</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, the
        same answer as that using only the completers. In fact, a
        simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algebra</ENAMEX> can show that this is always so. We can see
        that (c) is in-between (a) and (b), and in this case, leans
        toward (b). See <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reported that a proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        of 'randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> completed the protocol with
        effective control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> and no side effects' (as explained
        earlier, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> should instead be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.4%</NUMEX>), while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        in (c) is an estimate of the chance of effective control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> without side effects with the study therapies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Month</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, under an assumption of 'no information available for the
        missing data'. We should not be confused with these two
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">'80%</NUMEX>'. The former <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> is a wrong summary number; the latter
        is an estimate of the quantity of interest with a
        particular assumption about the missing data. This
        assumption is not likely to be appropriate for all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dropouts</ENAMEX>, especially for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who dropped out
        because of ineffective therapy; more discussion is given
        later. We do not know whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> might have
        intended to make the latter estimate but gave a wrong
        summary instead.
        Even more interesting and useful would be the same
        calculations within each treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> along with a
        comparison of the estimates. Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> did
        not give the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> according to their
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Using proportions simplifies the illustration, but the
        idea can easily be conveyed to the estimation of continuous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> as well, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX>, exercise time, hemodynamic
        measures, and lipoprotein levels.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lessons</ENAMEX> learned
        Several points can be generalized from the simple
        illustration given above and closer examinations of the
        other examples.
        • It does not take very much missing data to mislead an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>. A good principle to avoid being misled is to
        always account for every subject randomized to the study in
        the analysis. Using the total number of randomized subjects
        in the denominator is a step towards accomplishing this
        principle, whether it is to calculate an average or a
        proportion. This principle is known as intent to treat
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX>). However, the much harder job for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> is to account
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> in the numerator. This requires further
        consideration, which follows below.
        • It is important to record and report the reasons for
        withdrawal and the number of subjects in each category of
        withdrawal according to their treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The reasons
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> dropping out can be used to help properly
        assess the nature of the missing data. For example, if all
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> were because of a lack of response or side
        effects, then the calculation in (a) would be appropriate.
        In statistical terms, they would be called informative
        missing data. This is because useful information can be
        found in the reason for the dropout and this can be used to
        estimate the true response. Outcome-related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">informative</ENAMEX> and should not be disregarded in analytical
        study without careful thought. In particular, when a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> dies, whatever the cause of the death might be,
        such as in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Example 3</ENAMEX>, all of the subsequent physiological
        and quality of life data should not even be regarded as
        missing, but as having values equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or the worst
        category. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s clinical status has reached a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">terminal disease</ENAMEX> progression stage (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Heart</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) and they are unable to perform
        exercise testing, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Example 3</ENAMEX>, the exercise time should
        also be equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>, and not simply regarded as
        missing data. For the same reason, the remaining survival
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> after death (of any cause) would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> as well,
        not a censored observation when doing, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX>,
        survival analysis for an endpoint such as cardiovascular
        death. Treating non-cardiovascular death as equivalent to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">censoring</ENAMEX> because of loss-to-follow-up or
        end-of-observation for an endpoint of cardiovascular death
        has unfortunately become a popular practice in many medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> articles. This needs to be corrected.
        • The extreme calculations in (a) and (b) enable us to
        assess the uncertainty of the data which contains missing
        values, especially if we do the calculation for each
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> separately. The bias seen in the medical
        publishing industry in the decisions over which articles
        are chosen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> is a mirror image of the dropout
        problem in patient studies. In the former, positive studies
        have better chance of getting published, while negative
        studies have a higher chance of being rejected. The same is
        true for the latter: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> responding to treatment tend
        to continue in the study, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> failing to respond
        tend to drop out prematurely. Using only the available data
        or only the subgroup of those who complete the study leads
        to a biased result. The approaches in (a) and (b) take this
        consideration into account, although they may also be
        biased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-correction.
        • The assumption underlying the approach in (c) is
        interesting. When no particular information is known about
        the missing data, we are essentially assuming that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> are not much different from the completers. This
        is generally described statistically as missing completely
        at random (MCAR), meaning that the process which caused the
        missing data is not informative about the parameter that we
        are trying to estimate. A good way to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX> is that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> are a simple, random sample of the study
        sample. Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have moved
        away, or study that has closed and the late entry of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> being administratively 'censored'. We have seen
        the convenience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX> in the above illustration: simply
        use the completers and we get the same result. However,
        whether this assumption is valid or not should be examined
        carefully in each individual case. In many situations,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> are not the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> as those who
        stayed within the trial. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX> certainly is less restrictive
        than the assumptions in (a) or (b). Still, other less
        restrictive assumptions than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX> exist, and these are
        discussed later.
        • All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> estimates given by (a), (b), and (c) are
        biased to a certain extent. Had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> given the
        detail about the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropout</ENAMEX> categories of 'lack of
        response' and 'side effects', a better estimate could be
        derived.
        • We would certainly feel more comfortable with a study
        conclusion when it is not altered by different approaches.
        Sensitivity analysis is actually the best way to analyze
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>. Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        should consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statisticians</ENAMEX> when dealing with missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> because there are many possible methods available.
        Some popular approaches are reviewed below.
      
      
        More about methods handling missing data
        
          Objectives
          As in any data analysis, the first consideration is
          the objective of the analysis. In the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dropouts</ENAMEX>, there can be two types of questions: (i) What
          would be the treatment effect without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>? and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          What would be the treatment effect in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>? Question (i) is concerned with an ideal
          situation. It is also known as a 'question for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explanatory</ENAMEX> trials' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It is often concerned with
          the human pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> under
          investigation rather than practical usage. Regarding
          question (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>), we need to further differentiate two
          situations: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> drop out either (a) totally from the
          study and no data are collected after withdrawal, or (b)
          merely from the study assigned treatment with data still
          being collected. For (b) there will be no missing data.
          If we can design trials that will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to be
          followed until the end of the study despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          lack of compliance, then (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) is a very practical
          question, also known as the 'question for pragmatic
          trials' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> studies with all-cause
          mortality as the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">endpoint</ENAMEX> usually follow this
          design. However, other endpoints may also be followed-up
          (until death) in such a design. A recent example is [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
          , in which all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, even those who discontinued
          treatment (lovastatin or placebo), were contacted
          annually for vital status, cardiovascular events, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> history. Since no missing data would occur, the
          design of (b) is highly recommended for all trials if at
          all possible. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> principle originally aims
          to answer question (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) with (b) type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>, where
          no missing data would occur. However, more often than not
          we face studies in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have withdrawn from the
          study entirely and caused the missing data problem, ie,
          type (a), as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Examples 1-5</ENAMEX> (with the exception of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Example 3</ENAMEX>) above have demonstrated. Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          clinical status does not permit further testing after
          discontinuing the study treatment, type (a) dropout
          problem is a common design flaw and should be corrected.
          Nevertheless, the problem of no follow-up data prevails
          in clinical trials. For clinical trials conducted for
          drug registrations it is possible that, in light of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Conference</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harmonization</ENAMEX> (ICH)-E9
          guideline [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , the data analyses have to address both
          questions (i) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Imputation methods
          The analyses illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2were</ENAMEX> methods in the
          general category of imputation. In general, the basic
          idea of imputation is to fill in the missing data by
          using values based on a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with assumptions.
          There are methods based on a single imputation and
          methods based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple imputation</ENAMEX>, which, instead of
          filling in a single value for each missing value, replace
          each missing value with a set of plausible values that
          represent the uncertainty about the right value to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impute</ENAMEX>. The attraction of imputation is that once the
          missing data are filled-in (imputed), all the statistical
          tools available for the complete data may be applied.
          Each method of (a), (b) and (c) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2is</ENAMEX> a single
          simple imputation method, but together they may be viewed
          as a 'multiple simple imputation' method (as opposed to
          the 'proper multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imputation</ENAMEX>' method discussed below).
          The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2only</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time-point (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Month 6</TIMEX>) for
          analysis.
          For longitudinal data with multiple time-points, the
          conventional last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF)
          approach is a common practice of another simple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imputation</ENAMEX>. This approach was used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in
          Examples <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 5</NUMEX>. Attempting to follow the principle of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> to account for all randomized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> method includes
          every randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> who has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          post-therapy observation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> is popular among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> because it is simple to put into effect and
          because of a misconception that it is conservative
          (meaning working against an effective treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>).
          However, every imputation method implicitly or explicitly
          assumes a model for the missing data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> assumes
          (unrealistically) that the missing data after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          withdrawal are the same as the last value observed for
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The consequence of this assumption is that
          it imputes data without giving them within-subject
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> and that it alters the sample size.
          Proper multiple imputation (PMI) methods are described
          in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , which use regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to
          create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> imputed data sets and thus provide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> within and between imputations. PMI method
          has long been a preferred approach in survey research.
          Its popularity has recently gainied in clinical trials
          since the method became automated by commercial computer
          software [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . However, the complexity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> models used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMI</ENAMEX> should be carefully thought
          through by clinical trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, because the
          method assumes that the missing data process can be fully
          captured by the regression model employed on observed
          values. This assumption is called missing at random
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAR</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAR</ENAMEX> essentially says that the cause of the missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> may be dependent on observed data (such as data of
          previous visits) but must be independent of the missing
          value that would have been observed. It is a less
          restrictive model than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCAR</ENAMEX>, which says that the missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> cannot be dependent on either the observed or the
          missing data. The design suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Findlay</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , which forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> upon observing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncontrolled BP</ENAMEX>, uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAR</ENAMEX> principle. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAR</ENAMEX> or MCAR
          conditions are met, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based analyses can be
          appropriately performed based on the observed data alone
          without further modeling the missing data process.
          Another imputation method, which is in-between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMI</ENAMEX>, is the partial imputation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>) or improved
          LOCF method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The idea of this method is quite
          simple. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> imputes every missing visit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-point by carrying the last observation forward until
          the end of the study. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LOCF</ENAMEX> requires the strong
          assumption of stability, the more it imputes the more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> it introduces if the assumption of stability does
          not hold. The method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> does not always carry the
          observations to the end time-point of the study, but just
          far enough to balance the dropout patterns between the
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The underlying principle is that when
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropout</ENAMEX> patterns are made almost identical between
          the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the relative comparison of the
          treatment effects will be less biased. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> does less
          imputation, it is less biased than LOCF because the
          assumption of stability usually does not hold. Some
          simulation results under various missing data processes
          demonstrated the potential usefulness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> over the
          methods of using all available data and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          However, more experience is still needed to test this new
          method in practice.
        
      
      
        Methods based on special missing data models
        Other, more sophisticated methods based on statistical
        models are available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] ; a technical review can
        be found, for example, in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . No general
        computer programs are available to put them into effect
        though, because every so-called informative missing data
        set requires a unique model to describe it.
      
      
        Methods based on ranking observations
        A large class of non-parametric methods is based on the
        ranks or 'scores' of the observations instead of the actual
        values. Commonly used non-parametric methods in clinical
        trials include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> signed-rank test, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
        test, and so on. Example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> also used a ranking method after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOCF</ENAMEX> for a secondary analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incorporating</ENAMEX> missing data
        into these methods can be easily done, by ranking the
        missing data, according to the reasons for withdrawals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] , and, in longitudinal study cases, the time of
        withdrawal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . For example, death would be given the
        worst rank, followed by 'lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>', then 'adverse
        reaction', 'patient refusal', and so on. Within the same
        category of withdrawal, early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> would be given worse
        ranks than later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>. Ground rules for the ranking
        should be set prior to unmasking the treatment codes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analyses to avoid being post-hoc. After missing data
        are replaced by their ranks, the usual testing procedure
        can be carried out. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major drawback in these methods is
        that they do not provide any estimation of the treatment
        effect in the original measurement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, because the data
        are replaced by the ranks.
        All these methods, parametric or non-parametric, require
        much closer collaboration between medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statisticians</ENAMEX>. In the parametric case, the observed outcome
        cannot provide statistical tests to select the missing data
        models. In both cases, the validity of the various models
        or ranking rules requires an examination of the missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> information and strong faith in the reasons given for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' withdrawal. Still, the main issue is the
        question that these methods are addressing. They attempt to
        follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> principle (but with missing data) to answer
        question (i) above, hoping that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> can
        hypothetically be removed by, say, a truly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> design, or
        by successfully using concurrent treatments for intolerable
        side effects without affecting the efficacy of the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Composite comparisons
        Many believe that removing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s dropout process
        is not plausible in clinical practice. In this case, the
        dropout process itself may be an outcome of interest and
        not a nuisance effect. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Federal Drug</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>'s draft guidance on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> trials
        specifically requested the consideration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the problem becomes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'composite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX>' issue. This is the approach taken in
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , and it has lately been extended to modeling the
        joint distribution of the longitudinal and time-to-event
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (ie, time to withdrawal) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . In this setting,
        we would compare the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> aspects
        simultaneously: (a) the chance (or duration) of complying
        with the prescribed protocol and, (b) the outcome measure
        (eg, mean change in systolic blood pressure) given the
        pattern of compliance. The comparison (a) is
        straightforward by either the standard binomial or survival
        techniques. The comparison (b) requires the same care as
        has been discussed here previously, because, given the
        pattern of compliance, the subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has already
        been self-selected. The randomization mechanism used for
        achieving comparability between treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is broken
        by the post-randomization stratification of compliance. It
        is then important to check the key outcome-correlated
        baseline characteristics between the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for
        any incomparability among these subgroup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This was
        done in Example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> but not others. Recognizing that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> are no longer randomized, we should treat this
        portion as a semi-observational study imbedded in the
        randomized trial. Techniques used for analyzing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies should be applied to this part of
        comparison [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Generally speaking, in an observational
        study, bias can only be reduced but not entirely eliminated
        by methods of adjustment or matching. Sensitivity analysis
        in this approach is to consider different baseline
        covariates for matching or adjustment.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The issue of what to do about missing data caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> in clinical trials is a research topic that is
        still under development in statistical literature. As has
        been noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICH-E9</ENAMEX> guideline [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , 'no universally
        applicable methods of handling missing values can be
        recommended.' The issue of handling missing data is
        intrinsically difficult because it requires a large
        proportion of missing data to investigate a method. On the
        other hand, a large proportion of missing data would make a
        clinical study less credible. The best available advice is
        to minimize the chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> at the design stage and
        during trial monitoring. A truly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> design is absolutely
        encouraged. This requires follow-up data to be collected
        even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> discontinue the treatment, whenever the
        clinical status of the patient permits. If it is
        anticipated that there will be many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>, then perhaps
        the study's duration should be shortened. Alternatively,
        the medical procedure that is deemed to be the most likely
        cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' withdrawal should be altered. All data
        after death of any cause should be given a value of zero
        instead of a blank. Consideration may also be given to
        define an endpoint (event), instead of a measurement value,
        as the primary response variable, which can be determined
        even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> withdraws from the study. In an
        analysis, one should be clear about the question or
        objective of the analysis with missing data, and conduct
        sensitivity analysis with a set of plausible, pre-specified
        models of the missing data.
