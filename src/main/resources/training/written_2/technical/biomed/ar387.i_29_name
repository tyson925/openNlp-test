        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteoarthritis</ENAMEX> (OA) of the hip is a frequent source of
        functional disability and pain in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 55</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. While the disease is generally assumed to be age
        related, there is evidence that health risk behaviors that
        might be potentially modifiable are involved in its
        development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Despite some evidence linking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>], this finding is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equivocal</ENAMEX> and has previously been documented mainly in
        small studies of relatively young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, usually in the
        absence of radiographic evidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>].
        The specific objective of this study was to examine
        whether excess body weight, a health risk that is
        potentially amenable to intervention, might be associated
        with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>. We hypothesized that because of a history of
        sedentarity, pain and/or a high prevalence of
        cardiovascular comorbidi-ties, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed as having
        clinical and radiographic hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> would tend to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese, rather than underweight or of normal
        weight. We further expected that if weight is implicated in
        producing damage at the hip joint, the prevalence of high
        body mass indices (BMIs) might be higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hip OA</ENAMEX> than in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Finally, because
        infection or prosthetic loosening after hip replacement
        might be weight-related, we sought to explore whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> requiring either prosthetic removal or
        reimplantation surgery are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese.
      
      
        Methods
        The presurgical <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">BMIs of 1021</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, ranging
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 to 94 years</TIMEX> and who had been diagnosed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> and radiographically as having moderate to
        severe end-stage unilateral or bilateral hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>, were
        calculated from the appropriate height and weight data
        found recorded in their complete medical records. The
        severity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' condition was determined by their
        Kellgren grades on radiographs and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> for
        Special <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Surgery Hip Scoring System</ENAMEX>, which includes an
        assessment of pain, walking status, muscle power and
        overall function, using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point scale for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>,
        systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">psoriatic arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lyme disease</ENAMEX>, septic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">traumatic arthritis</ENAMEX> were excluded.
        These data, which were available for the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing arthroplasty of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both hip joints
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January 1 and October 31, 2000</TIMEX>, were collected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systematically</ENAMEX>, along with pertinent demographic and
        clinical data by checking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> admissions at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a week. Excluded were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for whom all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were not available. The single hospital population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sampled</ENAMEX> was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Surgery</ENAMEX>, a
        world-renowned orthopedic hospital treating difficult cases
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> as well as standard cases of the disease from all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and all boroughs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> data were categorized according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>)
        guidelines of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988-1994</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and entered systematically
        onto a spreadsheet for purposes of primary analysis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were classified as underweight if their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was
        <<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.5 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>, of normal weight if it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.5-24.9 kg</NUMEX>/m
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, overweight if it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.0-29.9 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2and</ENAMEX> obese if it was
        â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>. Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> data required for comparison
        purposes were obtained from currently available
        population-based estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> adult
        population [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>] and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> age-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of
        both genders without symptomatic hip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoarthritis</ENAMEX> who
        were hospitalized concurrently.
        After the data had been coded and categorized according
        to gender, laterality, and surgical-procedure requirements,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> data were stratified and analyzed with respect to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-29</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-39</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-49</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-59</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-69</NUMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70-79, 80-89, 90-95 years</TIMEX>. Statistical analyses were
        performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPSS Version 10</ENAMEX> software.
      
      
        Results
        
          Patient characteristics
          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1021</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> studied, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">586</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX>
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, with an average age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66.09</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.70 years</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX> were white and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> were either black,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> or of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> ancestry. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> had
          evidence of a pre-existing medical condition, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
          cases requiring bilateral hip surgery were younger on
          average, with a mean age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54.24</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13.27 years</TIMEX> than
          those undergoing other procedures ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.001</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' age at
          symptomatic onset of their disease ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> months
          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>. Their overall impairment level was
          indicative of a cohort with mild or moderate functional
          impairments, requiring use of a walking aid in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the
          cases. There were none that could be classified as having
          normal physical function without impairment. There were
          also none that could be defined as having serious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impairment</ENAMEX>, such as being bedridden or aphasic.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> distributions
          BMIs indicative of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obesity were recorded
          for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 70%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the cases surveyed,
          while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1%</NUMEX> were classified as underweight. In contrast
          to age-adjusted population data for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 20-74</TIMEX>, of
          whom <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> are considered obese [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> sample we studied were obese. The percentage
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> was also higher than
          the current prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> in the adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 34%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> in our study also had higher
          BMIs than those of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without any symptomatic hip problem
          who had an average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without any
          symptomatic hip problem who had an average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>, or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> who had a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.4</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age associations</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> indicated that each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was on average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese, except for age groups <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-29</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-95 years</TIMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24.0 Â± 2.7 and 23.0 Â± 1.9</NUMEX>,
          respectively. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the highest percentage
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was found in the age
          ranges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-59 and 60-69 years</TIMEX>, the average age at which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hip OA</ENAMEX> is generally expected to occur in any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          However, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in these age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
          also categorized as being obese more often than older
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-49 years of age</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-39-year</TIMEX> age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> contained the highest percentage of obese patients
          of all ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.001</NUMEX>), and their average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28.2 Â± 7.3 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>) was very close to the definition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Gender associations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> had higher mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in all age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-39 years</TIMEX>. Analysis according to weight
          categories showed that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese in all categories except the morbidly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obese</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> ><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>), where there were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Among all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>, a
          smaller percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> than of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were
          categorized as having 'normal' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMIs</ENAMEX> or as being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underweight</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Comparative data
          Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values were found for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
          unilateral and bilateral hip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> and revision
          surgery. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>sided lesions
          tended to be heavier than those with right-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
          As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX>, those who had comorbidities, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, were heavier
          than those with no comorbid disease history.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with unilateral infected
          prostheses that required prosthetic removal, plus an

          were undergoing reimplantation surgery because of
          uncontrolled infection, had higher BMIs than those of the
          other hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.008</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the removed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros-theses</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> following a previous

          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> and a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and atrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with complications
          Of the subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who required either
          removal or reimplantation of a prosthesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were
          rehospital-ized at twice the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were heavier on average, with a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31.3</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.8 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>, versus <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28.5 Â± 5.3 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2for</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were also younger (mean age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58.9</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.35 years</TIMEX>)
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> requiring the same procedure (mean age
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71.75</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7.9 years</TIMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 30-39 years</TIMEX>, an age range not
          implicitly associated with the presence of degenerative
          disease of the hip, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had evidence of a prior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">comorbid disease</ENAMEX> history. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> required
          surgical revision and one required reimplantation
          surgery.
          Regression analysis showed that of age, side, type of
          surgical procedure (unilateral or bilateral joint
          replacement, revision, debridement, relocation or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reimplantation</ENAMEX>) and gender, the only significant
          predictor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was surgery type ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.035</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our most important finding was that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two-thirds</NUMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in our sample were overweight at the time
        of their surgery. This figure is higher than that recorded
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> ages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-39 years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutrition Examination Survey</ENAMEX> (NHANES) III sample, in which
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2or</ENAMEX> higher [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The high BMIs
        recorded for those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30-39 year</TIMEX> age range (mean for
        females <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28.3 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2and</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27.9 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>) were very
        similar to those deemed by Heliovaara 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roach</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] to increase the risk of
        developing hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX>, which are rough indicators
        of fatness, were observed to a similar extent with respect
        to both unilateral and bilateral cases of hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>. This is
        noteworthy because according to the NHANES findings of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hochberg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and a related study by Nevitt 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], obesity is associated
        more strongly with bilateral than with unilateral hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. Our findings are also interesting in light of the
        case-control study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VingÃ¥rd</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">239</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with BMIs
        greater than the mean + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> for the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>;
        that study did show an increased risk of developing severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hip OA</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        less than the mean + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. Those slightly obese at 40 years
        of age had a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> for later surgery of the
        hip. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartz</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> of the hips was
        significantly associated with obesity only in white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        and nonwhite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of the our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> comprised
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellgren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> to be
        at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> of the hips [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Overall, the percentage
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> who had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obese</ENAMEX> range was higher than those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> reported for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in general [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. In our study, almost
        twice as many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-39 years of age</TIMEX> with hip OA
        (an age when significant hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> is relatively uncommon)
        were obese or overweight relative to national standards [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. While these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> standards are subject to
        error and may not be representative of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> because
        of sociodemographic and other factors, we observed that
        nonosteoarthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> of similar ages had lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> on
        average than those with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> of the hip in the context of the
        same hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> and study time period.
        While having hip OA could lead to obesity, and while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> may not be related and hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> may not
        occur in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> to the same extent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 17</TIMEX>], it
        is possible that cumulative exposure to excessive body mass
        may increase the risk of subsequently developing hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>] and the worsening of the disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 15, 18</TIMEX>].
        This could occur through either metabolic or mechanical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanisms</ENAMEX>, or both, and these mechanisms could prevail to
        differing degrees in susceptible males and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        Although, with rare exceptions, no independent relation has
        been found to exist between metabolic correlates of obesity
        and the presence of knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 19</ENAMEX>], the same relation may
        not apply to the hip joint [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. It has also been shown
        recently that those who have high BMIs are likely to have
        decreased hip joint rotation and lower strength capacity as
        a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>], and this may
        detrimentally affect the loading patterns at the hip joint
        by fostering the repetitive application of greater axial
        loads than the hip joint can accommodate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 23</TIMEX>].
        Our study design and data analyses do not permit us to
        discern what the initiating factor causing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hip OA</ENAMEX> was, or whether having hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> may lead to pain and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sedentary</ENAMEX> lifestyle. Moreover, we cannot determine whether
        a subsequently increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> is more important than other
        factors in increasing the risk of hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>. However, studies
        of the effects of body mass on avian degenerative joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, which shares common pathologies with human
        degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, have clearly shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> can be
        mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. That the majority of patients
        who required prosthetic reimplantation had high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> may
        indicate an association between being overweight and a poor
        postsurgical prognosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. This observation is further
        supported by the study of Stickles 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], who observed an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and problems climbing stairs 1 year
        after total joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arthroplasty</ENAMEX>. There is also a weak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between pain in the hip and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], and
        evidence that body weight and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> are significant
        predictors of the onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> of the hip [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. That
        prosthetic removals were warranted for a greater proportion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in our study, even though males
        constituted a smaller proportion of the study sample as a
        whole ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), may imply the existence
        of different pathogenic processes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        The finding that more obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> under the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        sustained postoperative infections than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> suggests
        that obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> under the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 60 years</TIMEX> may
        be especially vulnerable to postoperative infection and may
        therefore have a poor prognosis.
        Because we did not obtain serial measurements in this
        study, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> observed for a large percentage of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hip arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> cannot be deemed causative of the
        disease process. Conversely, we have no evidence that hip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> led to the presence of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> in our study sample.
        Yet the possible influence of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX> in mediating
        postoperative hip infections and further hip OA disability
        cannot be ignored. Our data suggest that we should not
        exclude the possibility that the proclivity to be inactive,
        together with high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body masses</ENAMEX> that produce increased joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loading</ENAMEX>, may have resulted in the premature hospitalization
        of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-39-year-olds</TIMEX> in this sample. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 95%</NUMEX> of
        the cases we studied had medical evidence of long-standing
        cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insufficiencies</ENAMEX> and other comorbidities such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, although frame size, muscularity, fat
        distribution and the changes of aging may all be reasons
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> being classified as having a high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, as might
        the factor of height [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], the implications of our data
        for preventing hip joint <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should not be overlooked.
        Although the measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> is not an ideal measure and
        does not reflect the distribution of obesity at all
        adequately, it remains the preferred measure of fatness for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Our conclusion that body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> may influence the etiopathogenesis of hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> is also
        supported by the work of others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 5, 24</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>].
        Although not without limitations, our data provide
        additional support for the view that symptomatic unilateral
        and bilateral hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> is associated with an increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
        especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 30 and 59 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        with post-prosthesis complications may also have increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMIs</ENAMEX>. This suggests that interventions to prevent
        overweight early in adulthood may mitigate the magnitude
        and prevalence of hip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> and its related disability.
        Longitudinal analyses of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to confirm the
        present findings and to test the above hypothesis are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>.
