        Thymocyte development occurs within a complex network of
        cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, and secreted factors referred
        to as the thymic microenvironment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Current evidence
        suggests that this microenvironment is created during fetal
        thymus organogenesis through stage-dependent interactions
        between differentiating thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and
        developing thymocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> at
        different stages of thymocyte development result in
        differential effects on TEC differentiation and function.
        Because of the complex interdependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> and thymocyte
        differentiation, defects in fetal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> development can be
        caused either directly by cell-autonomous TEC
        differentiation defects, or indirectly by defective
        thymocyte maturation. Once a mature thymic environment is
        formed, many, if not all stages of thymocyte maturation
        require interactions with thymic epithelial cells.
        Therefore, defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> can in turn cause defects in
        thymocyte differentiation, proliferation, or cell
        death.
        Thymocyte differentiation undergoes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3 -4 -8 -</ENAMEX>(triple
        negative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX>) to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+8</NUMEX> +(double positive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX>) stages.
        During this transition, T cell precursors sequentially gain
        and lose cell surface expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD44</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>,
        express the pre-T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> receptor (pTCR), and undergo
        Î²-selection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . The other transition is from CD4
        +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +single positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>) thymocytes, in
        which DP cells express <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, rearrange their Î±-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>, undergo
        positive and negative selection, and down regulate CD4 or
        CD8 to become functional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 +SP T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
        . In addition to functional and cell surface marker
        changes, each thymocyte differentiation stage is marked by
        characteristic changes in proliferation and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        The most well defined role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> in directly
        affecting thymocyte differentiation is to mediate positive
        selection via expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 19 20 21 22</NUMEX>
        ] . However, it is still unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> directly
        promote specific stages of thymocyte differentiation during
        stages that do not involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC-TCR</ENAMEX> interactions, or whether
        their role at other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> is primarily to promote cell
        growth and /or survival. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokines</ENAMEX> produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> have
        been shown to promote proliferation in early stages of
        thymocyte development, and have been proposed to regulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and differentiation, although their precise roles
        remain controversial [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> have also been shown
        to promote thymocyte proliferation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SP cells</ENAMEX> after
        selection has occurred [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However, a defined role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> at the TN-DP transition remains elusive. Much of the
        research on this transition has focused on the role of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-TCR</ENAMEX>. Mounting evidence suggests that the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> does
        not require interaction with a ligand to perform its
        function, and the subsequent CD44 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-25</NUMEX> -(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TN4</ENAMEX> or pre-DP) to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DP</ENAMEX> transition has been termed "programmed differentiation"
        to indicate that this step can occur in isolated
        thymocytes, presumably without input from extrinsic signals
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . However, there is also evidence that the
        thymic microenvironment does contribute signals required
        for the TN-DP transition, particularly to promote thymocyte
        proliferation and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . The specific
        nature and purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> contribution during this
        important transition therefore remains to be
        determined.
        In order to investigate the regulation of thymocyte
        development by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>, we are studying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Hoxa3
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pax1</ENAMEX> are transcription factors that act in a common
        pathway regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymus organogenesis</ENAMEX> and thymic
        epithelial cell development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants have defects
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> development including reduced numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>, fewer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> Class II +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>, and changes in TEC proliferation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. These TEC defects result in thymocyte maturation
        defects that include a decrease in total thymocyte number
        and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold reduction in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> thymocytes, but
        an apparently normal transition from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TN3</TIMEX> to the pre-DP
        stage. The decrease in DP cells is associated with
        increased apoptosis in both pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and DP cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . As
        the defects at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> transition in these mutants are
        caused by defective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> function rather than
        thymocyte-intrinsic defects, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> represent an
        opportunity to study the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> in promoting this
        transition.
        To further investigate the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> in promoting
        thymocyte death and growth during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> transition,
        we assayed the proliferation of specific thymocyte subsets
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation, which detects cycling cells in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX>. We compared fetal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> with 
        Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 34</NUMEX> ]
        . We also assayed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, which have defects in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> development due to arrested thymocyte maturation at the
        TN3 stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . We found stage-specific differences in
        proliferation levels between fetal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX>. We also found distinct patterns of thymocyte
        proliferation in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>and 
        Hoxa3,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pax1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>. The abnormal cell
        death and proliferation patterns in the 
        Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound mutant fetal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> might be caused in part by observed reductions
        in the transcription levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokines IL-7</ENAMEX> and SCF
        produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>. Our results support a critical role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> in regulating thymocyte
        proliferation during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> transition, and show that
        this function is disrupted in 
        Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Thymocyte proliferation patterns are different in
          fetal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>
          As an initial analysis, we compared thymocyte
          proliferation between thymocytes from late fetal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E17.5</NUMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-8 week</TIMEX>) wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL6/J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Although
          differences in the proliferation of fetal vs. adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>-expressing thymocytes and have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ,
          we were interested in investigating the more immature
          thymocyte subsets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">BrdU</ENAMEX> labeled fetal and adult thymi
          were analyzed for the percent of proliferating cells in
          different CD3 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4 -8</NUMEX> -TN thymocyte subsets defined by CD44
          and CD25 expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+4 +8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was
          defined by co-staining of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> markers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). A
          typical analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in DP cells and the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four CD44</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD25</NUMEX> subsets within the TN cell population
          is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Compiled data for each subset from
          all experiments is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          The wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1F</TIMEX>) and fetal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D,
          1F) thymocyte proliferation profile patterns differed
          significantly at specific stages. The overall
          proliferation level in TN cells was increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in
          fetal thymocytes (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). Most dramatically, the
          percentages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in fetal thymocytes were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> at the earliest, TN1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD44 +25 -</ENAMEX>) thymocyte differentiation stage (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). A much lower, but still significant increase was
          seen in fetal TN2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> increase, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>).
          Proliferation was also significantly higher at the fetal
          TN3 stage compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> increase, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>).
          Proliferation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TN4</TIMEX>/pre-DP (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD44 -25 -</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> was
          similar between fetal and adult thymocytes. In contrast,
          DP cells showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold increase in proliferation in the
          fetal thymus relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          nearly every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> from the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> stages
          showed significantly increased proliferation in fetal
          thymocytes relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
          It was possible that the lower percentage of
          proliferating cells seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TN1</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in adults
          was due to an increased number of B cells and NK cells in
          the adult thymus, which would not have been excluded in
          our initial analysis. As this was one of the most
          striking differences seen between fetal and adult stages,
          we repeated this analysis adding antibodies against B220
          and NK1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 8</NUMEX> in the excluded gate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1G,
          1H). Even excluding these cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, there is
          still a significantly lower percentage of proliferating
          cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TN1</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the adult thymus than in
          the fetal thymus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1I). Therefore, this difference is
          not due to different numbers of B and NK cells in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adult</ENAMEX> vs. fetal thymus.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>fetal thymocytes have a stage-specific
          increase in proliferation relative to wild type
          We also compared proliferation of fetal thymocytes
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to the results
          obtained from wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thymocytes</ENAMEX> in the adult 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-thymus</ENAMEX> have been previously
          shown to have overall lower levels of proliferation than
          adult wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TN thymocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , particularly at
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN3</NUMEX> stage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] . At fetal stages, our
          results showed that proliferation also varied between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> in the wild type and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>thymus at discrete stages
          of thymocyte differentiation. At the earliest <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN1</NUMEX> stage,
          thymocyte proliferation levels in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>thymi were similar to fetal
          wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1F</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). At the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN2</NUMEX> stage,
          fetal thymocytes from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had a proliferation
          level nearly twice that of wild type fetal thymocytes (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). By the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN3</NUMEX> stage, the percentage of
          proliferating 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-thymocytes</ENAMEX> had dropped
          slightly below that of wild type fetal thymocytes (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
          decrease, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), equal to wild type adult TN3
          proliferation levels. In addition, the percentages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TN1 and TN2</TIMEX> subsets in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>fetal thymus were
          significantly higher than those of the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). These results with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>fetal thymocytes contrast
          with thymocytes in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-</ENAMEX>adult, which have much lower
          proliferation than wild type adult thymocytes at all
          stages of thymocyte differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Thymocyte proliferation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hoxa3</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/-</ENAMEX> Pax1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>thymocytes at the TN-DP transition
          Our previous analysis of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutant thymocyte
          phenotype showed a specific partial block at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to DP
          transition, associated with increased apoptosis at both
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN4</NUMEX>/pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> subsets, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold decrease in
          DP cell numbers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BrdU</ENAMEX> analysis, we compared
          the proliferation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>fetal thymocytes during the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> transition compared to littermate controls.
          Thymocyte proliferation levels for all genotypes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 +/-,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>) were similar to wild type
          in all of the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TN1-TN4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,2C</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>), consistent with the normal percentages and cell
          numbers for these subpopulations previously reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          ] . Recent papers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penit, et al.</ENAMEX> have provided data
          from cell cycle analysis suggesting that a discrete CD44
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> lopopulation with a specific proliferation profile
          can be identified, such that the transition from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TN3</TIMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> can be further subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD25</NUMEX> hi, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lo</ENAMEX>, and
          CD25 -subsets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Analysis of proliferation using
          these more narrowly defined subsets still showed values
          similar to wild type in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD44 -25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">losubset</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,2F; Table 2</ENAMEX>). In contrast, the proliferation level
          of DP cells increased nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> mutants
          compared to wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2F</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In spite of
          this increase in the percentage of proliferating cells,
          the actual number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> +DP cells was reduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold
          compared to wild type in the compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15.03</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.73 Ã— 10 4vs</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61.94 Â± 32.12 Ã— 10 4in</NUMEX> wild type; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). The numbers of proliferating cells at the pre-DP
          stage were unchanged (not shown). Combined with our
          previous results, this result shows that both increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and reduced proliferation contribute to the
          decrease in DP cells in the 
          Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>.
          Unfortunately, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> die at birth,
          preventing analysis of thymocyte proliferation in adult
          compound mutants.
        
        
          Cytokine production is decreased in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-fetal thymus</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokines</ENAMEX> produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> are good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for
          mediating at least some of these changes in thymocyte
          proliferation and apoptosis in the 
          Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>. Using
          semi-quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, we analyzed the expression of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cytokines that are produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX>, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooled</ENAMEX>, genotype-matched E14<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> thymi (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants had
          decreased transcription of both cytokines relative to all
          other genotypes, including 
          Pax1 -/-single mutants. However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants were not
          completely missing either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokine</ENAMEX> analyzed, and the
          magnitude of the decrease was variable between pools.
          To test whether the changes in cytokine levels were
          responsible for the observed thymocyte development
          phenotypes, we attempted to rescue these phenotypes by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX> in fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC).
          E15.5 embryonic thymic lobes from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> separately in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTOC</ENAMEX>, with or without added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-7</ENAMEX>
          or SCF. Cultures from control genotypes (wild type, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 +/-,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>) behaved as expected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44 45 46</NUMEX> ] , with addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX> causing an
          increase in the percentage of DN cells and a
          corresponding decrease in DP cells, while adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> had
          no significant effect on thymocyte development (data not
          shown). However, to our surprise the two separated lobes
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants did not
          always develop in predictable ways. In fact, separated
          lobes cultured under identical conditions in the absence
          of any added cytokines had widely differing results.
          Changes in thymocyte cell number and differentiation
          after culture were highly variable; for example, cell
          numbers could differ stochastically after culture by as
          much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold between two</NUMEX> lobes from the same compound
          mutant embryo. This result was never obtained with
          separately cultured thymic lobes from any other genotype,
          which always developed identically when cultured without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX>. This property of the compound mutant thymic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lobes</ENAMEX> probably reflects phenotypic variability previously
          seen in our histological and gross morphological analysis
          of these mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 34</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we have examined thymocyte proliferation
        in the fetal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> wild type thymus. Our results showed
        clear stage-specific differences in wild type thymocyte
        proliferation depending on the developmental age of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> (i.e. fetal vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>). We also analyzed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutant strains that have either cell-autonomous ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>) or non-cell-autonomous ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag1 -/-</ENAMEX>) TEC defects, with blocks at
        different stages of thymocyte differentiation. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Abnormal TEC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in both of these mutant strains resulted in
        both increases and decreases in thymocyte proliferation in
        a stage-specific manner, rather than simply an overall
        reduced ability to promote proliferation.
        There is considerable evidence that thymopoiesis differs
        in the fetal thymus during the initial creation of the
        microenvironment, as opposed to adult thymus function
        (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] ). Differences have been reported in
        responses to some cytokines, in signaling at the TN-DP
        transition in fetal compared to adult thymus, and in
        proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 +SP thymocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . The
        proliferation profiles of both wild type and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-</ENAMEX>fetal thymocytes support the
        hypothesis that fetal thymocyte maturation is fundamentally
        different from thymocyte development in the adult thymus.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> stages both show increased proliferation in
        wild-type fetal thymocytes compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. This
        difference at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN1</NUMEX> stage is not due to the presence of
        more B or NK cells in the adult thymus. Although it is
        formally possible that some other cell type may still be
        included in our TN1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, this analysis strongly
        suggests that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TN1</NUMEX> cells have different proliferation
        profiles in fetal and adult thymus.
        It has been well documented that thymocytes in adult 
        Rag1 or 
        Rag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> have dramatically
        reduced proliferation compared to wild type, particularly
        at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN3</NUMEX> stage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penit et</ENAMEX> al.
        reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2-10</NUMEX> fold reductions at every stage of thymocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Recent work by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petrie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> has shown that this reduced proliferation is
        not intrinsic to 
        Rag mutant thymocytes, but rather is
        secondary to thymic microenvironment defects in 
        Rag mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Our results show
        that at fetal stages, 
        Rag mutant thymocytes have a
        proliferation profile that is much more similar to wild
        type thymocytes at the same stage, with less than a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        difference in the percentage of proliferating cells at any
        stage. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN3</NUMEX> stage thymocytes in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-</ENAMEX>adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thymus</ENAMEX> have
        proliferation levels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold below wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 37</NUMEX>
        ] , while in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-fetal thymus</ENAMEX> TN3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25-30%</NUMEX> lower than in wild type fetal thymus.
        Proliferation is not changed at all stages, and is actually
        increased relative to wild type at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN2</NUMEX> stage. This
        increase at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TN2</NUMEX> stage may be due to the failure of TN2
        cells to initiate TCRÎ² gene rearrangement at this stage,
        which is normally associated with decreased proliferation. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-mutants</ENAMEX> have a profound
        thymocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">development block</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TN3</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TN4/preDP</ENAMEX>
        transition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal wild</TIMEX> type fetal thymus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, significant DP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell development</ENAMEX> does not occur
        until E16.5 in most genetic backgrounds. As a result, at
        E17.5 the thymic microenvironment in 
        Rag mutants has not been exposed to
        abnormal thymocyte development for very long, and has not
        yet developed the full phenotype seen in the steady state
        adult 
        Rag mutant thymus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        In the 
        Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>,
        cell-autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> defects cause a partial block at the
        DN-DP transition, so thymocytes do progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SP</ENAMEX>
        stages, albeit at reduced frequencies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . TEC defects
        are seen as early as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E12.5</ENAMEX> in these mutants, from the
        earliest stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the
        TEC defects in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> would be expected to have
        different effects on thymocyte proliferation than in 
        Rag mutants. In this study, we found
        stage-specific changes in thymocyte proliferation at the DP
        stage. Our previous analysis reported decreased DP cell
        number and increased apoptosis in both the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and DP
        stages in these mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . DP cell numbers in both
        this and our previous study were decreased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>. At first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glance</ENAMEX>, the increase in the percentage of proliferating
        cells at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> appears contradictory to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. However, this increase actually corresponds to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">decreased</ENAMEX> numbers of proliferating DP cells compared to
        wild type. In contrast, pre-DP cells did not have a change
        in the number or percentage of proliferating cells,
        suggesting that the signals promoting proliferation of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is still present, and that proliferation of DP
        and pre-DP cells may be regulated independently. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pre-DP</ENAMEX>
        cells do have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fold increase in apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ,
        suggesting that separate signals regulate proliferation and
        survival of these cells. Combined with our previous data,
        this result suggests that the decrease in DP cell numbers
        seen in the 
        Hoxa3<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Pax1</TIMEX> compound mutants is both
        due to an increase in the number of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> and DP cells
        undergoing apoptosis as well as a decrease in the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proliferating DP</ENAMEX>.
        Insufficiencies of multiple cytokines might be involved
        in the changes in proliferation and cell death at the CD44
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> -and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> stages in 
        Hoxa3<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX> are first expressed as early as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E12.5</ENAMEX> in the
        developing thymus, well before significant thymocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> takes place [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . Although the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX>-fold in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>, the number
        of thymocytes is reduced by a slightly greater amount,
        around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the reductions seen in
        cytokine message levels in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants are not
        secondary to decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> numbers. In fact, these mutants
        should have a relative increase in the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>,
        making the reductions seen in cytokine levels in the mutant
        thymi even more striking. The reduced expression of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>compound mutants could be an
        indirect effect of defective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEC</ENAMEX> differentiation, or could
        be direct downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> since both 
        Hoxa3 and 
        Pax1 are expressed in fetal thymus [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . Comparison of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>phenotype with those of
        cytokine mutants do not reveal many similarities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 46 56</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59 60 61</NUMEX> ] , probably because of the simultaneous
        reductions in multiple cytokines in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-mutants.</ENAMEX> For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX> have been shown to have synergistic functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63</NUMEX>
        ] . Therefore, changes in multiple cytokines in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>mutants would be expected to
        have complex effects on thymocyte development that could be
        difficult to predict.
        Interpretation of the observed phenotype is further
        complicated by the fact that none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> tested
        are completely absent. A striking example is the complete
        absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î³Î´TCR</NUMEX> +thymocyte development in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, in
        contrast to normal Î³Î´TCR +cell development in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , which have
        dramatically reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-7</ENAMEX> levels. This result suggests that
        although Î³Î´TCR +cell development requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7</ENAMEX>, low levels
        are sufficient for this function. Therefore, analysis of
        mutants with low levels of cytokines may provide a system
        for uncovering both dosage-dependent requirements and later
        functions for these factors in promoting thymocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. It is also possible that some of the
        differences seen between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoxa3 +/-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pax1 -/-</ENAMEX>and cytokine mutant
        phenotypes reflect different effects of cytokines at fetal
        and adult stages. Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7R</ENAMEX> mutants showed
        relatively normal thymocyte maturation at fetal stages,
        albeit with reduced thymocyte numbers, in contrast to a
        severe block in thymocyte differentiation in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thymus</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] . Analysis of cytokine mutants during fetal stages
        could therefore reveal a more complete picture of the role
        of these cytokines during fetal thymus development.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results show that fetal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> wild type
        thymocytes have stage-specific differences in
        proliferation, with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TN1</ENAMEX> and DP cells exhibiting higher
        levels of proliferation in fetal thymus. This fetal
        wild-type profile was very similar to that seen for fetal 
        Rag mutant thymocytes, in contrast to
        adult 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-thymus.</ENAMEX> Therefore, the changes
        in proliferation seen in the fetal 
        Rag mutant thymocytes reflect the
        earliest microenvironment changes occurring as a result of
        defective TEC-thymocyte interactions in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rag -/-thymus.</ENAMEX>
        The current study further supports a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX> in
        regulating both thymocyte proliferation and survival during
        the DN-DP transition, and suggests that proliferation and
        apoptosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TN4</ENAMEX> and DP cells are regulated independently.
        Our results provide direct genetic evidence for these
        functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECs</ENAMEX>, by showing that these processes are
        defective in mutants with a primary TEC differentiation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defect</ENAMEX> (the 
        Hoxa3,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pax1</TIMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mutants</TIMEX>). Taken
        together, our results further define the role TECs play at
        this complex stage of thymocyte development.
