          Model of an oscillating biochemical network
          In [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laub</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loomis</ENAMEX> propose a model of the
          molecular network underlying adenosine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX>'-cyclic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophosphate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>) oscillations observed in fields of
          chemotactic 
          Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The
          model, based on the network depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, induces
          the spontaneous oscillations in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> observed during the
          early development of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum. 
          In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, changes in the enzymatic activities of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are described by a system of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          non-linear differential equations:
          
          where the state variable 
          x = [ 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,..., 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] represents the concentrations of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACA</ENAMEX>], 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX>], 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERK2</TIMEX>], 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REG</ENAMEX> A], 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>],

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] and 
          x 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> = [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAR1</TIMEX>] and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> different 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           represent system parameter values. It was shown
          numerically in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] that spontaneous oscillations appear
          at the nominal parameter values found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Note
          that because there are typographical errors in the
          original paper, the values being used here for the
          nominal parameters were obtained directly from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          This particular model is primarily concerned with
          describing self-sustaining oscillations in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> system. From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, it is clear that at the
          nominal parameter values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, this is achieved.
          We seek to determine whether the system is robust - that
          is, if we change these kinetic parameters, will the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> oscillatory behaviour persist? We next present
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible means, based on whether parameters are
          changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at a time or in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Single parameter robustness: Bifurcation
          analysis
          Self-sustained oscillations such as those being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modelled</ENAMEX> here appear as stable limit cycles in trajectory
          of the underlying dynamical system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The existence
          and stability of these limit cycles may change under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parametric</ENAMEX> perturbations. Whenever a stable periodic
          solution loses stability as we vary the underlying
          parameters of the system and this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution transitions</ENAMEX> to
          another qualitative solution - for example, a
          steady-state equilibrium - we say that the system
          undergoes a 
          Hopf bifurcation. It is therefore
          possible to use bifurcation theory as a means of
          quantifying the robustness of this oscillatory network
          model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
          Using the bifurcation analysis package AUTO [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ,
          it is possible to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-parameter bifurcation
          diagrams for each of the model parameters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX> illustrate the steady-state
          behaviour of the systems as the parameter values are
          changed. Suppose that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopf</ENAMEX> bifurcations occur at 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           
          
            i 
           and 
          
            i 
           so that (stable) limit cycles occur for the range ( 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
            
              i 
             
           , 
          
            i 
           ). Both the size of this interval as well as the
          proximity of the nominal parameter value to either
          boundary are measures of the robustness of the system. To
          compare the robustness of the system to the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, we can define a series of parametric
          robustness measures. We define the 
          degree of robustness (DOR) for each
          parameter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           as:
          
          It is straightforward to see that this value is always
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. The former indicates extreme
          parameter sensitivity whereas the latter implies large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insensitivity</ENAMEX>.
          Bifurcation diagrams provide an excellent means of
          determining the robustness of systems to single parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbations</ENAMEX>. We next describe a method for analysing
          and quantifying robustness to simultaneous changes in
          several parameters.
        
        
          Multiparametric robustness: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Structural</ENAMEX> singular
          values
          
            Determining the limit cycle: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harmonic</ENAMEX> balance
            method
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step is to obtain a mathematical
            expression for the limit cycle oscillation. The
            harmonic balance method can be used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The basic
            idea is to represent the limit cycle by a Fourier
            series with unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficients</ENAMEX> ( 
            a 
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , 
            i  , Ï† 
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , 
            i  ) and period 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> :
            
            The non-linear differential equation can be used to
            set up a series of algebraic equations that the
            coefficients must satisfy. These equations can be
            solved using numerical packages such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathematica</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>. Depending on the particular form of the limit
            cycle, a small finite number of coefficients can be
            used. We can denote this periodic solution as 
            x *( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ).
          
          
            Linearization
            The non-linear differential equation must now be
            linearized about this periodic orbit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Writing
            the state vector 
            x ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) as
            
            x ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
            x *( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) + 
            x 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )
            then the local behaviour of the non-linear system is
            governed by that of the linearized system:
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) â‰… 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( 
            x *( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )) 
            x 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â‰ˆ</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )
            where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobian matrix</ENAMEX> of the
            vector field 
            f . Note that since the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearization</ENAMEX> is performed about a periodic orbit, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> system is periodic.
          
          
            Restructuring into nominal/uncertainty
            systems
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobian matrix</ENAMEX> includes all uncertain
            parameters. At this point we need to separate the
            system into a nominal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and a feedback
            interconnection that involves all parametric
            uncertainty. We first write each parameter as
            
            where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
            
              i 
             is the nominal value and Î´ 
            
              i 
             is the relative amount of perturbation in the 
            i thparameter. We now separate
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobian matrix</ENAMEX> as
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( 
            x *( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )) = 
            A 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) + 
            B 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) Î” 
            C 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
            where 
            A 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobian matrix</ENAMEX> with
            all parameters at their nominal value, and Î” is a
            diagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix</ENAMEX> containing all the uncertainties Î´ 
            
              i 
             . Let 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
            C 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) 
            x 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = Î” 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ), the system is now of the
            form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqn</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) (with 
            x (

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )).
          
          
            Discretization
            The system can be discretized by sampling the state
            and output with sampling period 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> = 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/n</ENAMEX> , where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is a positive integer and
            assuming that the inputs are piecewise constant; this
            is also a standard technique in control engineering [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . In particular, a linear continuous-time system
            governed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqn</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) gives rise to the discrete-time,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> system

            Lifting
            The final step in preparing the system for SSV
            analysis is to transform the periodic, linearized
            system into an equivalent time-invariant one. The
            technique for this is known as 
            lifting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Rather than
            giving the general formulae, it is easier to illustrate
            the general principle with an example.
            Suppose that a discrete-time system with state
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable Î¾</ENAMEX>, input 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , and output Î· obeys the
            difference equation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¾</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) = 
            a ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k )Î¾</ENAMEX>( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) + 
            b ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î·</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) = 
            c ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k )Î¾</ENAMEX>( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )
            where the time varying coefficients 
            a ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ), 
            b ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) and 
            c ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) are all periodic with period
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Calculating the state variable and output
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">step-by-step</ENAMEX> leads to:
            
            for any integer 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> . By defining "lifted" inputs
            and outputs
            
            and considering the system state only at the even
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points ( ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">= Î¾</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> )) we arrive at an equivalent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-invariant system.
            The lifting technique has been illustrated above for
            a discrete-time system with period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX>; however, it can
            be applied to systems with arbitrary period - though
            the corresponding formulae are considerably more
            complicated; see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Computation of SSV
            There is considerable literature in control theory
            on the computation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX>; see for example [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] . For general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of uncertainty, computing Î¼ 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î”</ENAMEX> is known to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-hard [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
            Typically, given the feedback loop consisting of 
            G and Î” we compute upper and
            lower bounds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The lower bound is
            exactly equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î”</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ; unfortunately computing
            this lower bound involves a search over a non-convex
            set and therefore may converge to local optimums that
            are not global. In contrast, the upper bound can be
            rewritten in terms of a convex optimisation problem, so
            that a global minimum can be obtained. However, this
            upper bound is, in general not tight. A software
            package is commercially available that can compute Î¼ 
            upper and uses a power algorithm
            to attempt to compute Î¼ 
            lower [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Single parameter robustness
          The robustness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laub</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loomis</ENAMEX>'s oscillatory model
          was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysed by means of single-parameter
          bifurcation diagrams. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> typical diagrams are shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The activity of internal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> ( 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ) is plotted as a function of the
          variation of each parameter. We use internal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagram</ENAMEX> as it is the element that is usually observed
          experimentally [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In each of the diagrams, there
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX>: stable steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
          unstable steady state and limit cycle oscillations.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX> illustrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopf</ENAMEX> bifurcations occur
          for each parameter; that is, the oscillatory behaviour
          exists only in a limited range of parameters around the
          nominal value. For each of these parameters, the
          respective intervals and values for degree-of-robustness
          are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Structural singular value
          From the numerical simulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-linear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we observed that the oscillatory curves
          did not deviate greatly from a simple harmonic oscillator
          plus a constant offset. Thus, to obtain an analytic
          expression for the periodic orbits we assume that the
          state variables are expanded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourier</ENAMEX> series
          containing only the fundamental and constant terms:
          
          for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Since it is the relative
          phase shift between each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> variable that is relevant,
          we assume that Î¸ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. The substitution of the Fourier
          series into the original equations leads to a series of
          real algebraic equations for the coefficients (not shown)
          whose solution was obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathematica</ENAMEX>. This leads
          us to obtain the corresponding periodic solutions where
          the values of 
          A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0,</ENAMEX> 
          i  , 
          A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX> 
          i  and Î¸ 
          
            i 
           are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The period 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 7.31 minutes</TIMEX>.
          This analytic solution matches well with the numerical
          simulation except for an arbitrary phase shift, which
          does not affect the shape and location of the limit cycle
          in the phase space and can thereby be ignored (not
          shown).
          Following our prescribed methods, we next linearized
          the system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobian matrix</ENAMEX> is obtained and was
          decomposed as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eqn</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) to obtain:
          
          The matrix 
          B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = { 
          B 
          
          i , 
          j  } where
          
          Similarly, the matrix 
          C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = { 
          C 
          
          i , 
          j  } where all coefficients are
          zero except for the following:
          
          Finally, 
          D 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and the perturbation structure
          is given by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î”</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diag</ENAMEX> {Î´

          Note that since the nominal trajectory is periodic,
          the matrix functions in the nominal description are also
          periodic. Note also that in the uncertainty matrix, Î”,
          some uncertainties are repeated (Î´ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ,Î´ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ,Î´ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> and Î´ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ) while Î´ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX> is missing.
          The system was then discretized and lifted following
          the procedure outlined above. A comparison of the system
          response for each of the approximations at the nominal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> values is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B.
          For the sampling time we tried various values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> but found negligible differences
          for values above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>. Finally, we computed the bounds
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX>. Once again, we found that the values of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bounds were not affected much by the sampling
          frequency provided that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>. The upper
          bound was successfully computed using [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The
          maximum over all frequencies is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12.06</NUMEX>.
          However, the high dimension of system causes convergence
          problem during the computation of Î¼ 
          lower using this package. To obtain
          an acceptable lower bound, we calculate the spectral
          radius at each frequency. This gives us a lower bound for
          Î¼ 
          lower . The plot of the bounds for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. We can
          use Î¼ 
          lower to obtain a conservative
          region for robust stability. The highest value over all
          frequencies for Î¼ 
          lower is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.636</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> has seen an appreciation that key cellular
        properties are robust to variations in individual parameter
        values. Based on the topology of many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>,
        this should not be surprising. Feedback - both negative and
        positive - control systems are ubiquitous in most
        biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and one of the reasons for using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX> is that it reduces sensitivity of a system's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviour</ENAMEX> to its parameter values.
        In modelling biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, it is important that
        this robustness also be in evidence. The particular
        behaviour being characterized by the model should not rely
        on precise values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s parameters - for example,
        reaction rate constants or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations. In
        particular, a precise measurement of these constants is
        difficult whereas protein concentrations will vary from one
        cell to another or throughout the lifetime of any
        individual. Deviations from the nominal model parameter
        values should not result in a loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s
        performance; thus, parameter sensitivity can be used to
        validate mathematical models of biochemical system. That
        is, the more insensitive the system response is to the
        accuracy of the parameter, the more faith we should have in
        the model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        In looking at certain classes of behaviour, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> changes in the stability of the system are
        possible, bifurcation diagrams provide an elegant means of
        evaluating robustness. For example, in evaluating the
        robustness of the model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laub</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loomis</ENAMEX>, of primary
        importance is determining whether the oscillatory behaviour
        will persist if the parameter values are altered. This
        qualitative difference in performance - from limit cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> to constant steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> - can be quantified
        and compared across parameters or from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> model to
        another. Once the robustness of the oscillatory behaviour
        is established, further investigations of the robustness of
        some of the oscillatory features, for example frequency and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitude</ENAMEX> can further be evaluated.
        From the bifurcation diagrams obtained for each of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> parameters, we know that oscillations exist only
        in a limited range around the nominal value. We find the
        system to be quite sensitive to variations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> and mostly insensitive to the others.
        Single-parameter bifurcation analysis also shows that the
        amplitude of the oscillation is greatly affected by the
        variation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> parameters ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ).
        Based on the SSV stability to interpret multiple
        parameter sensitivity, we can conclude that robust
        stability of the periodic orbits will be maintained,
        provided that
        
        Since the uncertainty matrix consists only of diagonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, this bound applies to each of the individual
        parameters. Thus, we can guarantee that the system will be
        robustly stable provided that no single parameter differs
        more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX> from its nominal value.
        In our analysis we found a large gap between Î¼ 
        upper and our lower bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î¼</ENAMEX>. As
        we later show, for this system the upper bound is fairly
        tight, as we are able to obtain a destabilizing
        perturbation of size <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>. For general biological models, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">robustness</ENAMEX> measure based on the upper bound Î¼ 
        upper may also be more appropriate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Robustness</ENAMEX> bounds for systems in which arbitrarily
        slowly-time-varying parameter values are allowed are known
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . For these systems it has been shown that the
        bounds converge as the time-variations approach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to the
        upper bound Î¼ 
        upper [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Since many of the
        parameters in models of biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> represent
        features that will vary over time, such as enzyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> may therefore be more
        indicative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s true robustness.
        The ability to consider the effect of time-variations on
        the robustness of the system is one great advantage of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> over other methodologies. One drawback of the SSV
        approach compared to the bifurcation theory is that it does
        not provide the precise combination of parameters that
        destabilizes the system - only its size. Also, since the
        upper bound is only sufficient to guarantee robustness,
        this number may, in general, give an overly conservative
        notion of robustness.
        It must be emphasized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> approach denoted here
        is based on the linearized model of the system. For some
        classes of systems this linearization may not be possible -
        in this case, the linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> approach documented here will
        not be applicable. However, for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> used to
        describe biochemical reactions, this should not be a
        problem.
        Because we are concentrating exclusively on the local
        stability of the linearized model, important parameters of
        the oscillatory behaviour such as robustness of the
        frequency and amplitudes of oscillation are not evaluated.
        Also, the effect of parameter variations on the equilibrium
        orbit are omitted. In particular, varying the kinetic
        parameters will change the behaviour of the system in two
        different ways: the equilibrium periodic orbit will change
        and the stability of deviations about this orbit will also
        change. The SSV allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to quantify the robustness of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effects. It does not say anything
        directly regarding the effect of parameter variations on
        the equilibrium periodic orbit. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of bounding the
        effect of these parameter changes is to write the original
        differential equation as
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
        f ( 
        x , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )
        where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> + Î´ is the set of kinetic parameters
        with nominal values 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . If the nominal periodic orbit (when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î´</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>) is given by
        
        x *( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
        x ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) - 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> )
        then, linearizing about this orbit yields
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
        A ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î´</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) + 
        v 
        where Î´ is a constant vector that includes the effect of
        this parametric uncertainty. Thus, the system can be
        considered as being perturbed by a constant input signal 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> . Provided that the homogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is exponentially stable (and this is guaranteed by
        the existence of a stable limit cycle) and that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> is not "too large", the perturbed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will remain in a neighbourhood of the origin
        if the 
        f ( 
        x , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) in the original equation is
        reasonably well behaved in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> . Detailed bounds and conditions on
        
        f are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Theorem</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        , though it should be emphasized that these bounds tend to
        be overly conservative in practice.
        To illustrate the local nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> analysis for
        this system, we perturbed the system parameters by varying
        amounts. The particular parameters were either increased or
        decreased so as to bring them closer to the Hopf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bifurcation</ENAMEX>. For example, the nominal value of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is closer to 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
         
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 than to</TIMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> so that we reduced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> whereas 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> is closer to 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 than to</TIMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
         
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> so we increased 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7we show the response of
        these systems to changes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7% and 9%</NUMEX> both for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearized</ENAMEX> system - where the linearized response has been
        superimposed on the nominal limit cycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A) and the
        original non-linear system (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B). For the smaller
        value, the linearized response is stable and we see that,
        after a transient, the response settles to the nominal
        limit cycle. We also see this same behaviour in the
        response of the non-linear system with this level of
        parameter perturbation. For a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> change in the parameters,
        however, the linearized system is unstable. We see this as
        a deviation from the nominal limit cycle. In the non-linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>'s response, this translates into an end to the
        stable limit cycle. The response does not "blow up" but
        instead settles into a fixed point.
        This example illustrates how a robustness analysis of
        the linearized system can be used to deduce the robustness
        of the original non-linear system, as it shows that when
        the linearized system is unstable, the desired behaviour of
        the non-linear system will no longer be present. This
        example also points out the fact that the upper bound Î¼ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upper â</ENAMEX>‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX> is not overly
        conservative for this system as we were able to produce a
        destabilizing perturbation of size <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>.
        Finally, we note that multiparametric robustness
        analysis considered here is based on local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
        the dynamical system, since we are evaluating the
        robustness of the linearized model. Extensions to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-linear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are the subject of active investigation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] .
        However, it is by combining the robustness analysis of
        both single and multiple parameters, we can obtain a more
        thorough understanding of the region of stability of the
        periodic solution in the high dimensional parameter space
        and use this to improve upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. In this particular
        example, we find that the system's robustness is governed
        by several "robustness limiting" parameters, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Determining the robustness of mathematical models of
        biological systems is important for several reasons. First,
        there is growing evidence that many aspects of the networks
        being modelled have evolved in such a way so that they are
        robust as this allows them to tolerate natural variations
        in the environment. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful models</ENAMEX> should replicate
        this robustness. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, robustness of the models provide a
        means of validating model quality since the performance of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> should not rely on precisely tuned parameter
        values that are impossible - or at best - difficult to
        measure exactly.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we illustrated the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tools
        developed in dynamical systems theory and control
        engineering to assess robustness quantitatively. For an
        example, we considered an oscillatory molecular network
        model due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laub</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loomis</ENAMEX> that aims at describing
        oscillatory behaviour in cAMP signalling observed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> amoeba 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum. This behaviour appears
        as a stable limit cycle of the equations describing the
        model. We have evaluated the degree to which this limit
        cycle is robust to variations in all the system
        parameters.
        The robustness of the oscillatory behaviour to single
        parameter variations was quantified using bifurcation
        analysis. Using the bifurcation analysis software tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUTO</ENAMEX>
        we determined that single parameter changes as small <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 20%</NUMEX>
        from the nominal value can cause the limit cycle to
        disappear and a stable equilibrium to appear. In addition
        to the stability robustness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUTO</ENAMEX> is also able to evaluate
        the sensitivity of the amplitude of the oscillation to
        these parameter changes.
        To investigate the robustness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
        simultaneous changes in parameter values, the structured
        singular value (SSV) analysis tool was used. Once the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was in the correct framework for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSV</ENAMEX> analysis, we
        were able to determine that the system can only tolerate
        very small changes in the parameter values - in the order
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> - if we allow these parameters to vary with time
        arbitrarily slowly.
        Finally, it is important to note that to understand
        completely the robustness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of a model, it is
        appropriate to combine single and multiple parameter
        sensitivity analyses.
