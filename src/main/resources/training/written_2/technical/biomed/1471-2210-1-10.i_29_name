        High levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum cholesterol</ENAMEX> and low density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) have been associated with the genesis of
        atherosclerosis, a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases
        that affect a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all over the world. It
        has become clear that the pathological conditions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an excess level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> are actually caused
        by the oxidized products of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . More specifically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> (also termed oxysterols), the oxygenated
        derivatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, appear to be the major
        cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . These
        compounds have a hydroxyl- or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">keto- group</ENAMEX> on the
        cholesterol molecule. Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> oxides
        include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-OH-, 7-keto-, 19-OH-</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-OH- and
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] for a recent review).
        Tissue damage caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> has been the
        subject of many studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> are cytotoxic
        to a variety of cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . These compounds can
        damage endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and
        fibroblasts, all of which are major components of the
        arterial wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> are also toxic to cells
        derived from the immune system, such as macrophages,
        thymocytes, lymphoma cells and leukemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>cells.
        Pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX> capable of reducing cholesterol
        oxide toxicity are yet to be discovered.
        The mode of cell death caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> has
        generated much interest recently. There is evidence showing
        that programmed cell death (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX>, also known as apoptosis)
        occurs in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> is a special type of cell death that can be
        induced by growth factor deprivation or toxins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ]
        . By using the PCD induced by nerve growth factor
        deprivation in sympathetic neurons as an example, the cell
        death process begins with the generation of reactive oxygen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">species</ENAMEX> followed by a significant decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        uptake, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and protein synthesis, activation of the
        immediate early <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, c-jun, and release of cytochrome c
        from mitochondria. Cell death is executed by the activation
        of a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteases</ENAMEX> termed caspases. Morphologically,
        cells dying of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> appear atrophic and exhibit condensed
        nuclei, which can be stained with nuclear stains
        (bisbenzimide or propidium iodide), or by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted from cells dying of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> is often fragmented
        and shows a characteristic ladder-type pattern on the
        agarose gel upon electrophoresis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mitogen-Activated Protein</ENAMEX> kinases) have
        very important roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX>. The MAP kinase pathway
        consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> major parallel pathways designated as the ERK
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPK/JNK</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p46</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stress-Activated Protein Kinase/ c-Jun</ENAMEX> NH2-terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinase</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p38 pathways</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Activation of each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> above involves phosphorylation of a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the pathway.
        During growth factor deprivation induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> in neuronal
        PC12 cells, there is a sustained activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and
        p38 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> while the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway is
        inhibited. It was proposed that a dynamic balance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JNK-p38</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> can determine if the neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> will
        live or die [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Similar interplay of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> kinases
        was shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> of non-neuronal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . It is
        known that oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> can cause activation of MAP kinases
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX>, the main toxic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> in oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, can induce MAP kinase
        activation, and whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase activation</ENAMEX> has a role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide induced PCD</ENAMEX> remain to be investigated,
        and is the subject of this study.
        Peroxisome proliferator-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (PPARs)
        belong to a group of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> which includes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">steroid</ENAMEX>, retinoid, thyroid hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and others [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of PPARs: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> is found
        predominantly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, heart, kidney, brown adipose
        and stomach mucosa, and is important for lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catabolism</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> is found in adipose tissues, and is important for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adipogenesis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ²</ENAMEX> is found in most tissues, but its role
        is less well-defined.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> is expressed in atherosclerotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and
        is important in the process of atherogenesis. Depending on
        the experimental system and the particular question asked,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> can be involved with pro-atherogenesis or
        anti-atherogenesis. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> is involved in a
        positive feedback mechanism that induces the formation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foam cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, activation of PPARÎ³
        was shown to inhibit monocyte [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and macrophage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        inflammatory responses by preventing the activation of
        nuclear transcription factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-kB</ENAMEX> (nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">factor-kappa B</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">activator protein-1</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STAT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        (signal transducer and activator of transcription <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> plays an important role in atherogenesis, this
        anti-inflammatory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> should help to reduce the
        risk of atherogenesis. Development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonists that
        retain the antiatherogenic activity but dismiss the
        proatherogenic activities will be of great value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Many naturally occurring or synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> are
        agonists for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . For example, a number of
        prostaglandins are agonists for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-deoxy</NUMEX>-delta <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-PGJ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), is the most potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endogenous</ENAMEX> PPARÎ³
        agonist known. On the other hand, many synthetic compounds
        such as the non-steroid anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (NSAIDs)
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Since these are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> used clinically for other purposes, it is important
        to determine whether interaction of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with PPARs
        could modulate atherogenesis in a positive or negative
        manner.
        While most research regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> are
        focused on the cardiovascular system, it should be noted
        that the nervous tissue has the ability to generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX>, which may exert toxic effect on cells
        and tissues of the nervous system. For example, it has been
        shown that synaptosomes and mitochondria prepared from CNS
        tissue can convert <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX>, which
        may play an important role in brain tissue damage during
        oxidative stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with this notion, we
        have shown cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxides</ENAMEX> are toxic to neuronal PC12
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> derived from sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ganglia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and cerebellum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microglia</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system express
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scavenger receptors</ENAMEX> and are involved in the oxidized LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> and metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are, thus, the
        macrophage-equivalent in the central nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
        . Results from this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> showed that cholesterol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxides</ENAMEX> can cause programmed cell death in microglia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ,
        which suggests that microglia, similar to macrophages, can
        be a potential target for oxidized LDL toxicity.
        Based on the observations that: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. cholesterol oxides
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cause PCD</ENAMEX> but the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> remains to be
        investigated; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> are important in atherosclerosis but
        the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> activation on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> has not been determined, this study was designed to
        test if a dysregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> was associated with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide induced PCD</ENAMEX>, and to determine if PPAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> could modulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX>.

          Cytotoxicity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> toward
          microglia
          A set of dose- and time-response experiments indicated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that 5, 10</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol treatment for one
          day reduced the viability to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~97</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 and 52%</NUMEX> of controls,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M reduced the
          viability to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> of controls after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-day</TIMEX> treatment. In
          contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-Î²</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was much less toxic to
          microglia, such that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î¼M showed little
          toxicity to the cells after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 1-day</TIMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-day</TIMEX> treatment of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Î²-OH-cholesterol reduced the viability to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> of
          controls. These results confirmed and extended those
          obtained from our previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Activation of c-jun as a result of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol treatment
          Because c-jun was shown to play important roles in
          programmed cell death in many cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , and
          microglia were shown to undergo programmed cell death
          after cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , experiments
          were performed to determine if c-jun activation was
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide induced microglial</ENAMEX> cell
          death. Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Î²-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, then processed for
          Western blot analyses. Antibodies against c-jun,
          phospho-c-jun (at position serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ERK 1/2</NUMEX> (an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> which can recognize both <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ERK 1 and ERK 2</NUMEX>) were
          used in this set of experiments. Results indicated that
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> oxides caused an increase in c-jun in
          microglia, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol showing a more
          pronounced increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Furthermore,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> caused the phosphorylation of c-jun, a
          phenomenon not observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Î²-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX>. The levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK 1/2</NUMEX> were not altered by
          either treatment. These results suggested that c-jun
          activation was associated with the toxicity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX>.
          A set of experiments was performed to determine any
          dose-dependent change in c-jun activation by
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>. Microglia were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 or 20 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, then
          processed for Western blot analysis. Results indicated
          that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol treatment led to an increase in
          c-jun and phospho-c-jun at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serine 63</NUMEX>. The levels of ERK
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> were not altered by this treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Time-dependent change of MAP kinase
          activities
          Further studies were performed to determine the effect
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> on different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX>.
          The time-dependent change in c-jun, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX> levels
          was determined. Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3, 6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 or 24 hours</TIMEX>, then
          processed for Western blot analyses. Results indicated
          that there was an increase in c-jun after
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol treatment <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1-12 hours</TIMEX> of
          treatment. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> dropped to a non-detectable level
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after treatment. In addition, there was an
          increase in the levels of phospho-c-jun on the serine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> (at both position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> and position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX>). The
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JNK 1 and JNK 2</NUMEX>), however, were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altered</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> were similar during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, then dropped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 12-24 hours</TIMEX> after treatment.
          The levels of phospho-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> increased <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1-6 hours</TIMEX>
          after treatment, then decreased to a non-detectable level
          afterwards (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This decrease in phospho-ERK
          expression occurred at a time coincided with the
          appearance of phospho-c-jun. The changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX> or
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phospho-p38</TIMEX> levels were minimal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Modulation of c-jun activation by PPAR
          agonists
          It was reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> activation could
          down-regulate the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 by interfering with
          the functions of c-jun [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, the
          following set of experiments was designed to test if PPAR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> could reduce c-jun activation in
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> treated microglia. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonists
          including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-steroid
          anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, indomethacin and ibuprofen, were
          tested in this series of experiments. Cells were treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> together with these PPAR
          agonists for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, then processed for Western blot
          analyses. Antibodies against c-jun, phospho<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-c-jun</NUMEX> (at
          serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK 1/2</ENAMEX> were used in this set of
          experiments. Results indicated that while
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol induced the expression of c-jun and
          phospho-c-jun, these PPAR agonists reduced the expression
          to various degrees. The apparent potency to reduce
          phospho-c-jun among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> tested was: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">15d-PGJ</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> > indomethacin > ibuprofen
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These results indicated that while 15d-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was very effective in inhibiting
          c-jun activation, ibuprofen appeared to be ineffective in
          this regard.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonists attenuate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> in microglia
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonists</ENAMEX> appeared to reduce the c-jun
          activation caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol treatment, the
          following experiment was designed to test if these agents
          could reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>.
          Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> together
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonists to be tested for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, then the
          viability of each treatment was determined. Results
          indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could prevent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol
          induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. While
          treatment of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol
          reduced the cell viability to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of controls, addition
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.62</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 or 10 Î¼M</NUMEX> 15d-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> raised the viabilities to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 34</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The rescue by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> 15d-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was statistically significant (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at concentrations above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M was
          toxic to microglia. The solvent for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , methylacetate, was without any
          rescue effect.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indomethacin</ENAMEX> also prevented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol induced
          cell death in a dose-dependent manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 50</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M raised the viability
          from ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~11</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 19</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> of controls, respectively.
          A further increase in indomethacin to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼M did not
          increase cell viability. The rescue by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-200 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          indomethacin was statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). Ibuprofen, on the other hand, had little rescue
          effect even at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). It is important to note
          that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> also had no inhibitory effect on c-jun
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is considered to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonist,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indomethacin</ENAMEX> and ibuprofen can activate both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The following experiment was conducted to
          determine if a pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> agonist, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WY14643</TIMEX>, could
          modulate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>.
          Results indicated that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was without rescue
          effect at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 or 100 Î¼M</NUMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼M, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WY14643</TIMEX> raised the
          viability from ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% to ~28%</NUMEX> of controls. The difference
          was statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). No further
          increase in viability could be achieved by this agent
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-OH</TIMEX>-cholesterol induced an alteration of
          phospho-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK 1/2</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 6 hours</TIMEX> of treatment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), an experiment was performed to test if
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathways could affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol
          induced cell death. Microglia were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> together with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> AG126 (ERK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059</TIMEX> (MEK inhibitor, an up-stream member
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, then the viability of
          each treatment was determined. Results indicated that
          neither of the pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> tested had any
          rescue effect toward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25-OH</TIMEX>-cholesterol induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> pathway inhibitor,
          SB203580, had no rescue effect under the same
          experimental conditions (results not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> are formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>-containing
        food (powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg products</ENAMEX>) during storage [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] or during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> catabolism in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ]
        . The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat product</ENAMEX> increases
        significantly during the cooking process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
        can take up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> oxides in a way similar to the
        absorption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exogenously</ENAMEX> can be cleared from plasma rapidly and be
        widely redistributed in different parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> and authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> are
        transported within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by a similar mechanism, but the
        transport is more efficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        High levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> have been observed in
        hypercholesterolemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. For example, the plasma level
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol increases from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M to approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼M in rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> treatment can lead to alterations of
        cellular functions. These compounds can activate some
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> including steroidogenic factor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXR</ENAMEX>, which may be partially responsible for their
        biological activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol biosynthesis pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . The ability to
        bind to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular</ENAMEX> receptor, oxysterol binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, may be responsible for their inhibition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . It should be noted
        that addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> does not prevent cholesterol
        oxide induced cell death, which leads to the suggestion
        that inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol synthesis</ENAMEX> is not the cause
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide induced PCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] . The critical
        events that result in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> remain to be determined.
        Results from this study indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol
        was very cytotoxic to microglia, such that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-day</TIMEX>
        treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M 25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol reduced cell
        viability to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of controls. In contrast,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Î²-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was much less toxic to microglia (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2</ENAMEX>). Selective toxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> oxides toward a
        particular cell type was also observed in our previous
        studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Further experiments with Western
        blot analyses indicated that the cytotoxicity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX> was associated with their abilities to
        cause c-jun activation, as evidenced by the increase in
        activated c-jun, i.e., phospho-c-jun, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol
        treated cells but not in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Î²-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> treated cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). There was a dose-dependent increase in c-jun
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in cells treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        It has been suggested that a dysregulation of MAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> is responsible for the growth factor deprivation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] or chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this idea, results from this study suggest
        that an unfavorable balance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> causes the
        cell death observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> treated microglia.
        Cells treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> showed a
        time-dependent increase in c-jun <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as well as
        phospho-c-jun (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This c-jun activation was apparent
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> after treatment. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol
        caused a slight, initial increase in phospho-ERK, which
        decreased to a non-detectable level <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> after
        treatment. The change in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38 and phospho-p38</TIMEX>, on the other
        hand, was not as apparent. It was reported that rabbits fed
        with high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> diet exhibited high JNK protein
        levels and JNK activity in their atherosclerotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>,
        and oxidized LDL caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation in cultured smooth
        muscle cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Based on this study, there is a
        possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> oxides in oxidized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> were
        responsible for those previous observations.
        Activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway can lead to the
        phosphorylation of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">members</ENAMEX> including c-jun that
        belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transcription factor family [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 52</NUMEX> ] .
        Because results from this study indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway
        was activated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, one could expect that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 would be activated in cells treated with cholesterol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxides</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this idea, it was shown that LDL
        could induce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide</ENAMEX> treatment could lead to increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        DNA binding activity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 dependent transcription in
        other cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . Results from this study, thus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complemented</ENAMEX> and extended the findings of those
        reports.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonist, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , functions as a general inhibitor of
        microglial functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58</NUMEX> ] . For example, this agent
        inhibits the expression of inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthase</ENAMEX>,
        tumor necrosis factor-Î±, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interleukin-1 Î²</TIMEX> and major
        histocompatibility complex class <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microglia</ENAMEX>.
        Inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> 1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">STAT-1</ENAMEX>) and the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
        may be partially responsible for the inhibitory effects.
        Results from this study further indicated that PPAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> could reduce c-jun activation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Given the
        suggestion that an up-regulation of c-jun is a cause of PCD
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] , a reduction in c-jun activation by PPAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> should attenuate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-cholesterol induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this idea, results from this
        study indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , indomethacin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WY14643</ENAMEX> could
        attenuate the cytotoxicity caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> to
        various degrees (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 8, 10</TIMEX>). Since the protective
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WY14643</ENAMEX> could be observed only at concentrations
        higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼M, there is a possibility that this agent
        acted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> receptor to achieve the protection.
        Similar protective roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonists</ENAMEX> have been shown
        in other nervous tissues. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonists were
        shown to protect cytokine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> in cerebellar granule
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> could also block the neurotoxic
        effects caused by Î²-amyloid activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microglia</ENAMEX>, and thus
        might be beneficial in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . In non-neuronal tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> activation was
        shown to suppress both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spontaneous rat</ENAMEX> hepatocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> and
        the PCD induced by transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î²1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ]
        .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Treatment of microglia with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> caused an
        induction of c-jun, phospho-c-jun and a reduction in
        cellular viability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> agonists reduced the
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-OH</NUMEX>-cholesterol induced c-jun activation and attenuated
        the cytotoxicity. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of compounds may be useful in
        future development of pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxide induced cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cell culture
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N9</NUMEX> murine microglia cell line was a gift kindly
          provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . This
          cell line has been used extensively as a model for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64 65</NUMEX> ] . These cells were derived by
          immortalization of day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> embryonic brain cultures with a

          Cell viability
          Cells grown in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> cells/well, ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confluency</ENAMEX>) were treated with testing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for a period
          of time as indicated in the figure legends; then, the
          viability from each treatment was determined by the MTT
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,5-dimethylthiazole-2yl</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,5</NUMEX>-diphenyltetrazolium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bromide</ENAMEX>) assay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Culture medium was removed after
          treatment, then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> MTT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml prepared</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX>) was added to each well. The cultures were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incubator</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> solution was then removed, and the
          cells in each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> were lysed by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          dimethly sulfoxide. The plate was placed on a shaker for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> at room temperature to complete the lysing
          process, then the optical density of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> was
          measured by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with a filter setting
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">570 nm</NUMEX> (reference filter setting was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">630 nm</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Western blot analysis
          Protein isolated from cytoplasm was separated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> polyacrylamide gels and transferred to

          Statistical analysis
          Unless otherwise stated, results of cell viability
          experiments were pooled from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicate samples</ENAMEX> derived
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> independent experiments, and expressed as mean Â±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX>. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> (one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> test
          to determine the significance of difference.
