        Agrobacterium vitis <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of crown gall, an economically important
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . 
        A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is an effective
        biological control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> against many 
        A. vitis tumorigenic strains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> produces an antibiotic toxic to many 
        A. vitis strains 
        in vitro. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lines of
        evidence suggest that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> plays a minor role in
        disease suppression. Strains that are susceptible to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antibiotic</ENAMEX> 
        in vitro, such as 
        A. vitis strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG78</TIMEX>, are able to
        infect the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and Tn5
        mutants of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> lacking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> production appear
        to be unaffected in crown gall biological control [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Biological control by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is grape-specific, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is
        not effective on non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grapevine host plants</ENAMEX> such as 
        Nicotiana glauca. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>
        is not effective against all 
        A. vitis strains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        enhancing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> biological control phenotype and
        extending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> range of the efficacy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> beyond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grape</ENAMEX> would be beneficial for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> control in field
        applications.
        
        Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K84
        is the most studied crown gall biological control strain
        and is commercially utilized for crown gall disease control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. Strain K84 biological control is primarily due
        to production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two plasmid</NUMEX>-encoded antibiotics, agrocins
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84 and 484</TIMEX>, encoded by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pAgK84</TIMEX> and pAgK434
        respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Agrocin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX>, an adenosine analog [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        , is effective against tumorigenic strains carrying
        nopaline/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">agrocinopine tumor</ENAMEX>-inducing plasmids, and requires
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acc</ENAMEX> system in the target strain for
        activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agrocin 434</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di-substituted</ENAMEX> cytidine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>, is effective against, and specific for, a broad
        range of 
        A. rhizogenes strains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Curing
        of either agrocin-encoding plasmid results in reduction of
        biological control activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K84</NUMEX> demonstrates
        the efficacy of antibiosis for crown gall biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. However, the commercial application of the K84
        biological control system is limited where 
        Agrobacterium strains of certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> are not inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K84</TIMEX>. As a result, alternative
        biological control systems for crown gall <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are
        needed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trifolitoxin</ENAMEX> (TFX) is a peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> produced by 
        Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii
        T24. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibiotic</ENAMEX> production and resistance functions are
        encoded by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-gene 
        tfx operon and the unlinked 
        tfuA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> is derived
        from post-translational cleavage and modification of the 
        tfxA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> effectively
        inhibits growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the Î±-proteobacteria
        including strains of 
        Brucella, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochrobactrum, Rhodobacter</ENAMEX>,
        Rhodospeudomonas, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhizobium</ENAMEX>, and the etiological agent
        of crown gall <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> is highly
        specific for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as demonstrated by a lack of
        observable effect on the majority of the bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean rhizosphere</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This suggests
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> could be used to control crown gall diseases of
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with limited effects on non-target bacteria
        outside of that very specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX>-sensitive
        Î±-proteobacteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> is rapidly degraded in nonsterile
        soil but is readily extractable from sterile soil
        inoculated with a TFX-producing strain, suggesting that TFX
        is sensitive to 
        in situ proteolysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Despite
        this rapid turnover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production confers enhanced
        nodulation efficiency upon TFX-producing 
        Rhizobium <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> under field
        conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Degradation of antimicrobial peptides such as cecropin B
        and attacin E also has been observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> apoplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 16 17</ENAMEX> ] . This is likely due to apoplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteinases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 16</ENAMEX> ] . Expression of antimicrobial peptides
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> has had mixed results for enhancing disease
        resistance. For example, cecropin expression in transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> did not confer resistance to 
        P. syringae pv 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tabaci</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , likely due to low
        apoplastic peptide concentrations due to proteolysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, prior to this work it was not clear whether a
        peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> could play a role in the inhibition of
        galling by tumorigenic 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> in planta. 
        
        Agrobacterium rhizogenes is capable
        of producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TFX</ENAMEX> by addition of the stable plasmid,
        pT2TFXK, which contains the 
        tfx operon but not 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tfuA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 20</NUMEX> ] . This suggests
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production by crown gall biological control
        strains of 
        Agrobacterium, such as 
        A. rhizogenes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K84</ENAMEX> and 
        A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>, may be enhanced by TFX
        production. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> would be excellent delivery
        vehicles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> to the infection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
        Here we present experiments demonstrating the
        TFX-sensitivity of a range of 
        A. vitis strains and the effect of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production and resistance phenotypes on the
        expression of biological control of crown gall using the
        model plant 
        Nicotiana glauca. Strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> was
        chosen as the recipient of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this work
        because it is an avirulent strain that expresses a
        biological control phenotype on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. As a result,
        F2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/5</ENAMEX> is an ideal strain in which to test the ability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> system to confer biological control of crown gall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and to broaden the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-range efficacy of a known
        biological control strain.
      
      
        Results
        
          In vitroTFX antibiosis against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> vitis
          
          Agrobacterium vitis strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were tested for sensitivity to trifolitoxin. As
          expected based on previous results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , the tested 
          Agrobacterium vitis strains were
          sensitive to TFX-producing strains. However, the level of
          susceptibility was lower than predicted based upon
          previous TFX sensitivity measurements with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG48</ENAMEX> and CG74
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . No zones of 
          A. vitis growth inhibition were
          observed around 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum T24 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, and
          only relatively small zones were observed around 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> etli <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CE3</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>), which
          produces more TFX than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T24</TIMEX>. Furthermore, one 
          A. vitis strain, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>, was
          TFX-resistant.
          Because 
          A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> produces an
          antibiotic to which most of the tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
          sensitive [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> on 
          A. vitis was assessed against
          TFX-producing and non-producing 
          Rhizobium <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. None of the
          tested strains were sensitive to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T24</TIMEX>, which
          produces relatively low amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX>. All of the 
          A. vitis strains except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>
          were sensitive to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> etli <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CE3</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) as evidenced
          by zones of growth inhibition around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CE3</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. 
          A. vitis growth was not inhibited
          by a non-TFX metabolite or nutrient competition by
          CE3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) as evidenced by the lack of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> around
          the near-isogenic 
          tfxA mutant CE3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TX3K</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Wild type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of inhibition
          versus the other agrobacteria used in this work. This
          occurred because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> production previously
          observed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>. These zones of inhibition were much
          larger when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pT2TFXK</ENAMEX> was added to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> and unchanged with
          the addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pT2TX3K</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> vitisstrain
          F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>)
          Strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) inhibited TFX-sensitive 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum bv. trifolii
          ANU794 but had no effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ANU794</TIMEX> following addition of
          the TFX resistance genes provided by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pT2TX3K</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pT2TFXK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pT2TX3K</ENAMEX> confer resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX>,
          tetracycline, and kanamycin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pT2TFXK</ENAMEX> also providing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production to a host strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Since strains
          F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TX3K</NUMEX>) produced no zones of inhibition
          against ANU794 or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ANU794</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TX3K</NUMEX>) (data not shown),
          F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) is producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TFX</ENAMEX>. In addition, this shows
          that the agrocin-like molecule produced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> does not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">inhibit ANU794.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          In plantabiological control of crown gall conferred
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production
          As expected, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> did not inhibit galling by
          tumorigenic 
          A. vitis strains on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> glauca. However, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio of
          
          A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>):pathogen
          caused a statistically significant reduction in mean gall
          size relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> non-producing controls on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">glauca</ENAMEX> stems for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          tested tumorigenic strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>). High
          concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) also reduced gall
          incidence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG435 and CG78</TIMEX>, but not for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG49</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>):<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CG435</NUMEX> also resulted in a
          significant reduction in gall size and in gall incidence
          compared to controls. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>):CG49
          or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG78</ENAMEX> did not affect either incidence
          of galls or reduce gall size. Similarly, an excess (a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX> ratio) of any of the virulent strains to
          F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) resulted in a high incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and
          large gall size.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        As all strains of 
        A. vitis tested were sensitive to TFX
        both in this work and in a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ,
        experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness
        of a TFX-producing, avirulent strain of 
        A. vitis in the prevention of crown
        gall caused a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains of 
        A. vitis. Although 
        A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is an effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX>-gall biological control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> against most
        tumorigenic 
        A. vitis strains when co-inoculated
        with a tumorigenic strain, it is not an effective against
        all strains of 
        A. vitis. 
        Where 
        A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is effective as a
        biological control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX>, its control is only effective
        when numbers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> are equal to, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than</NUMEX>, the
        number of cells of the virulent strain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Strains that
        are resistant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> biological control are known. For
        example, strain CG78 is not controlled when co-inoculated
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> principle benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> are
        demonstrated here. Biological control is extended to a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> glauca. Furthermore, biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> is extended to a strain that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> fails to control
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CG78</NUMEX>). These effects are due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production as
        demonstrated by the lack of efficacy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG49</TIMEX>,
        CG435, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG78</ENAMEX>, and by the lack of efficacy of the
        near-isogenic TFX-non-producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TX3K</NUMEX>) against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG78</TIMEX>.
        TFX confers biological control when the TFX-producing
        strain is present in excess of the tumorigenic strain.
        Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) effectively inhibited gall incidence by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tested tumorigenic strains when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-inoculated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX>-fold excess.
        F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) inhibited gall size by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> with
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> tumorigenic strain tested. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 or 1:10</TIMEX> inoculum
        ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>):pathogen biological control was
        reduced or lost. High ratios of biological control:
        pathogen strain should be easily achieved in field
        situations by dipping the roots of planting stock in
        suspensions of the biological control strain, or by
        directly applying the bacterial suspension to the planting
        bed. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> is inhibitory towards all tested
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrobacterium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . These results
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production would enhance crown gall
        biological control for other biological control strains,
        such as 
        A. rhizogenes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K84</TIMEX>, and on other host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, especially where a mixed inoculum of different
        tumorigenic 
        Agrobacterium species occurs.
        K84 biological control is thought to be primarily due to
        production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two plasmid</NUMEX>-encoded antibiotics, each of
        which accounts for a portion of the observed disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . This naturally occurring example suggests
        that pyramiding biological control mechanisms within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        strain can enhance disease control. Strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> also
        produces an 
        A. vitis -specific antibiotic 
        in vitro, but this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> is not
        involved in disease control [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the addition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> is a successful example of pyramiding unrelated
        disease control mechanisms and clearly demonstrates that
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX> can be effectively developed as a
        mechanism of disease control.
        Although plasmid-borne traits are frequently unstable,
        pT2TFXK contains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RK2</NUMEX> plasmid-partitioning locus that
        confers a high degree of stability both 
        in vitro and under field conditions [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . Stable TFX expression would be beneficial under
        field conditions when the biological control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> is
        inoculated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> or on roots dipped in a bacterial
        suspension prior to planting.
        Trifolitoxin production enhances rhizosphere
        competitiveness of 
        Rhizobium etli <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CE3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) in
        sterile soil and enhances nodulation efficiency in
        non-sterile soil when compared to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX>-sensitive strain [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . Trifolitoxin production also increases bean
        nodulation competitiveness of 
        Rhizobium etli <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CE3</ENAMEX> in the presence of
        indigenous rhizobia under agricultural conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Field application of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> etli <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CE3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pT2TFXK</NUMEX>) dramatically
        reduced the diversity of indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Î±</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bean</ENAMEX> rhizosphere without affecting unrelated species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production by 
        A. vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX> should enhance the
        competitiveness and aid in establishment of this beneficial
        strain in the rhizosphere. The ability to displace
        indigenous tumorigenic 
        Agrobacterium strains would be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> in those areas already infested with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX>.
        Compared to other treatments available for pathogenic
        agrobacteria, the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> on non-target species is
        very low. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX>, a broad spectrum bacteriocide, is
        commonly used as a treatment of bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Although no comprehensive studies have been published on
        the taxonomic range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K84</TIMEX>, it is
        known that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K84</ENAMEX> produces multiple antibiotics and that K84
        can inhibit strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erwinia</ENAMEX> and 
        Pseudomonas that are unaffected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . TFX-producing strains inhibit only a
        very specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> within the Î±-proteobacteria in culture
        and in the field [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 26</NUMEX> ] . These observations suggest
        that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K84</NUMEX>-producing strain may have a more serious impact
        on non-target organisms than does a TFX-producing strain.
        However, there has been no study of the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K84</TIMEX> on
        non-target soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by culture-independent means to
        compare the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K84</TIMEX> versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> system in a
        natural system.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production effectively enhances crown gall
        biological control by 
        Agrobacterium vitis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-plant range and range of tumorigenic 
        A. vitis strains controlled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>
        are both broadened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> production. In addition, virulent
        strains of 
        A. vitis not previously controlled by
        F2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/5</NUMEX> are controlled following the addition of the
        trifolitoxin production and resistance genes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2/5</NUMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> used to confer trifolitoxin production and
        resistance, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pT2TFXK</TIMEX>, is stably maintained in the absence of
        selection pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This plasmid is not
        self-transmissible but is mobilizable. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFX</ENAMEX> system,
        the biological control of 
        Agrobacterium pathogens may be
        extended to many crops far beyond what is possible today
        with currently available commercial products.

          In plantabiological control of crown gall by
          TFX-producing strains
          
          Agrobacterium vitis strains were
          suspended in sterile distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> prior to the
          determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (CFU) per ml. These
          suspensions were adjusted to OD
