        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> introns are catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> that are also mobile
        genetic elements. Although their primary sequences vary
        considerably, the intron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> fold into well-conserved
        structures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The generalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II intron
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> helical domains
        emerging from a central wheel [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II
        introns are capable of self-splicing; however for efficient
        splicing 
        in vivo , the intron-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host-encoded</ENAMEX> splicing factors are required [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobile</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group II</ENAMEX> introns encode a reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptase</ENAMEX>/maturase,
        with the coding region generally located in domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> introns were first identified in fungal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> and grouped on the basis of their secondary
        structures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 5</NUMEX> ] . They have been found in organelle
        genomes of fungi and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and also in a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . None have been found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, although
        it has been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> of nuclear spliceosomal introns based on
        similarities between nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and the splicing mechanism used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of splicing, there is a nucleophilic
        attack by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point residue on the nucleotide at
        position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the intron, resulting in a lariat structure
        with the intron remaining attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' exon. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> transesterification results in exon ligation with
        the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lariat RNA complexed</ENAMEX> with the intron-encoded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This ribonucleoprotein (RNP) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is an
        endonuclease, which can initiate reverse splicing into an
        intron-less target site in a process known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrohoming</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . After the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron RNA</ENAMEX> reverse splices into one strand
        of the double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the intron-encoded protein
        cleaves the other strand at position +9 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> downstream
        of the intron insertion site, and the generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand is used as a primer for reverse
        transcription of the inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron RNA</ENAMEX>. Integration of
        the resultant cDNA occurs via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s recombination or
        repair mechanisms.
        At this point, however, it is not clear what the exact
        structural requirements for retrohoming are, or which
        tertiary interactions are dispensable for the reaction.
        This mutational study is an effort to understand what
        structural features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron RNA</ENAMEX> are important for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX> and to utilize that information to construct a
        minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron</ENAMEX> capable of retrohoming. The development of a
        core functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> would be interesting not only from
        an evolutionary perspective, but would also facilitate
        manipulation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Domain I
          Domain I possesses numerous intra- and inter-domain
          interactions by which it serves as a scaffold for intron
          folding. It associates with domain V to form the
          catalytic core. It is also important for recognition of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon in 
          cis splicing reactions and for
          targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Not
          surprisingly, deletions in sub-domain structures,
          particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ic</ENAMEX>, greatly diminish mobility. In this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, the ratio of 
          amp 
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R to 
          amp 
          R <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of each mutant,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the wild-type ratio, was used as a measure
          of mobility frequency. It is important to note that for
          mutants with a very low mobility (≤ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.001%</NUMEX>), this ratio
          may not reflect mobility frequency due to background 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and it was necessary to
          verify intron insertion by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> analysis.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> deletions in domain I retained some mobility;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain Ib</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.06%</NUMEX>, and the κ helix (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nts 190-204</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.37%</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ib</ENAMEX> deletion mutant had a mobility frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.06%</NUMEX>,
          which may indicate that the α tertiary element is not
          absolutely essential for mobility. This result is
          interesting in that only the α deletion mutant is mobile,
          while both the α' deletion and the α-α' double deletion
          are not. This is in contrast to the results of splicing
          assays with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> introns <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aI5γ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU/2</ENAMEX>,
          where it has been shown that the α-α' interaction is
          essential for splicing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . This discrepancy
          could reflect the fact that the mobility assay is more
          sensitive and can detect greatly diminished levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> and mobility. It is also possible that other
          structural features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ll</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LtrB</ENAMEX> or its interaction with
          LtrA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> help it properly orient important regions
          flanking the α element.
          Based on an earlier secondary structure of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Id</ENAMEX>(i-iii) region, the κ helix included positions <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">190-204</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). A deletion of this sub-domain resulted in a
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.37%</NUMEX>. However, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
          redrawn based on comparative analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          , and the new helix containing the κ interacting element
          was deleted (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nts 185-201</ENAMEX>), the frequency dropped over
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold. These results imply that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">κ-κ'</ENAMEX> interaction
          itself may not be essential for the activity of the
          intron, but the overall structure of this region is
          critical. This is further indicated by the deletion of
          the helix just above it (nts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210,339</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">346</NUMEX>), for which
          no mobility was detected. The finding that κ-κ' is not
          essential is similar to a finding by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX>/2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> in which a deletion of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)a stem
          loop containing the κ element was still capable of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Additionally, this element is absent
          from the introns 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S.p.cox2 I1,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.a.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cox1 I4</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A.m.cox1 I3</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.a.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cox1 I1</ENAMEX>, along with Id(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The loss of the interaction might also be
          compensated for by the intron-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This is
          supported by a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> enhanced crosslink between
          U191 (near κ in domain I) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C2421</TIMEX> (near κ' in domain V)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lambowitz</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
          None of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> sub-domain deletions in domain I
          were mobile. Even the double deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> α-α' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">β-β'</ENAMEX>, which presumably affect local folding and hence
          could be less deleterious overall, did not restore
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>. The observed homing frequencies in the range of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3- 10 -4%</NUMEX>, are close to the background level of
          appearance of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3%</NUMEX>).
          Surprisingly, neither the single nor the double
          deletions involved in the β-β' interaction are mobile.
          This interaction is not well conserved and is missing
          from some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> classified into the following
          structural categories: bacterial classes B (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">B2</NUMEX>-like
          intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>), C (novel hybrid) and D (unusual
          B-like) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . However, this region may be involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX>, based on strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> protections
          observed in this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Strong protein
          protections are also observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Id4</TIMEX> terminal
          purine-rich loop. In fact it is these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI</ENAMEX>,
          which exhibit the strongest LtrA protections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain II</ENAMEX>
          From the mobility analysis it is clear that deletions
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-domains</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> are mobile to some extent,
          while a complete deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">domain II</ENAMEX> is not functional.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> picked from both deletions were true
          homing events (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10/10</NUMEX>). This is consistent with previous
          reports where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bachl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmelzer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] showed
          that a partial truncation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DII</ENAMEX> leaving a short hairpin
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the intron bI1</TIMEX>, had no pronounced effect on splicing
          efficiency, whereas a complete deletion eliminated the
          reaction. This was also demonstrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aI5γ</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)a,b deletion of nucleotides <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">404-459</ENAMEX> was mobile to a
          small extent, (frequency <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.23%</NUMEX>). This region includes the
          η interacting element, indicating that it may not be
          essential for mobility.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">η-η'</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> has been primarily observed to
          mediate a conformational change between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . It is also missing from some
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class A1</ENAMEX> and bacterial classes B, C and D
          intron structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, which may indicate that it is
          not absolutely essential for splicing.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain III</ENAMEX>
          Many reports indicate that domain III is absolutely
          required for splicing 
          in vivo and 
          in vitro . Although its exact
          function is unknown, it has been speculated to be
          involved in the formation of the catalytic core [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Besides this, it was shown for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron</ENAMEX> aI5γ
          that the phylogenetically conserved basal stem loop
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most internalized regions of the
          molecule [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Here it was found that neither deletion
          in domain III could be tolerated. Frequencies were at the
          background level in both cases (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><10</NUMEX> -3to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4%</NUMEX>) and
          no bona fide homing events were found.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain IV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain IV</ENAMEX> is the most variable domain and has not been
          shown to have a large effect on either splicing or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>. In fact the mobility frequency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion</ENAMEX> is almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the wild-type intron, which is
          the highest mobility observed for any deletion in this
          report. In this case, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> tested were true
          homing events.
          Surprisingly the deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVa</ENAMEX> (which is the
          primary binding site for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LtrA</ENAMEX>) exhibited a low level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4%</NUMEX>), although the number of true homing
          events was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 60 - 80%</NUMEX>. This is likely due to residual
          binding whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LtrA</ENAMEX> recognizes other features of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> to promote splicing and mobility [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 18</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cui</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lambowitz</ENAMEX>, in preparation].
        
        
          Domain V
          It had previously been reported that the invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the catalytic AGC triad in domain V was
          critical for self splicing 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo . Here, point mutants of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> were made. Although the mobility frequency
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3- 0.25%</NUMEX>) was greatly diminished, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3A</TIMEX> was the
          least affected presumably reflecting a requirement for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purine</ENAMEX> and/or base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at that position, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G3C</ENAMEX> and
          G3U had frequencies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 100</NUMEX>-fold lower. Interestingly,
          it was observed upon sequencing the isolated homing
          products, that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3C and G3U</TIMEX> were revertants back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, the
          wild-type nucleotide. By contrast, the G3A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were
          verified to involve integraton of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3A</NUMEX> intron. For the
          G3C and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G3U</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">revertants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> plasmids from these 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were also isolated and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to verify that they had the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
          In a mutational analysis of the same triad in the aI5γ
          intron, it was found that mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3</TIMEX> were some of
          the more deleterious ones in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Revertants that
          restored base pairing were also identified. Further, the
          G3U mutant could not be rescued but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G3A mutant</ENAMEX> could,
          suggesting that a purine is required at this position, as
          seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ll</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LtrB</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domain VI</ENAMEX>
          A deletion mutant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">(ΔA54</NUMEX>), along
          with the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> substitution mutants <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A54G</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A54C</ENAMEX> and
          A54U were tested. Interestingly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ΔA54</TIMEX> mutant gave a
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.003%</NUMEX>, but upon sequencing the homing
          products, no true ΔA54 mutation was found. Instead, a
          variety of sequence changes surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point
          A were observed in the homing products, although the
          original deletion mutation remained the same in the donor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It appears that this mutation can be
          rescued by many kinds of secondary mutations as
          indicated. It was reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns could go
          through a hydrolytic splicing pathway to generate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> intron even without a bulged nucleotide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          Our findings suggest that if a linear intron is generated
          by hydrolytic splicing of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔA54</TIMEX>, it is unable to carry out
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>. Hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point nucleotide is
          absolutely required for mobility.
          Recently, the crystal structure of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">aI5γ</NUMEX> intron was
          determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Surprisingly, it revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> bulged
          nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVI</ENAMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aI5γ</TIMEX> it is
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point A and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following 3</TIMEX>' nucleotide which
          is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, that are both bulged out. This appears
          inconsistent with the revertant sequences here, which
          show selection for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Crick</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">position 3</ENAMEX>' but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX>.
          Support for the observations in this report comes from
          work by Chu 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] on the aI5γ
          intron, in which they propose that a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 bp stem 3</ENAMEX>' of the
          branch-point is one of the determinants for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Additionally, they state that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> wobble
          pair above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point is also a determinant, which
          fits in with the observation that a non-canonical pair
          (A:A or A:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) is found at this position in some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revertants</ENAMEX>. More recent support for this upstream weak or
          non pairing with simultaneous downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pairing</ENAMEX>, was
          observed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lariat</ENAMEX> forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroplasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13/16</TIMEX> introns lacked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson-Crick</ENAMEX> pairing above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C was
          the downstream base pair whenever there was an upstream
          A:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Additionally</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley intron</ENAMEX> was
          found, in which the upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Crick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> coincided
          with a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> or other weak pair.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> branch-point substitution mutants tested
          were mobile to differing extents with relatively high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.02%</NUMEX>), indicating that any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point position can function in mobility. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          of these products were true homing events.
          Although it is specifically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N6</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the
          branch-point A that is recognized, many lines of evidence
          suggest that the actual base at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> site is not
          required to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Naturally</ENAMEX> occurring introns have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> times), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 occurrences</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occurrence</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Comparative RNA</ENAMEX> Web Site database:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aI5γ</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> at the
          branch-point were found to allow for some branching to
          occur [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Also, it was observed that even if the
          branch-point residue was paired, it did not have a large
          effect on splicing efficiency and no effect on the choice
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          C was also found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point position in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8/25</NUMEX>
          ΔA54 homing products. From previous reports it was noted
          that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point nucleotide was changed to a C,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">branching</ENAMEX> was reduced [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22</NUMEX> ] . In this case it is
          likely that the sensitivity of our assay permits the
          detection of homing products. Surprisingly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A54G</TIMEX>, which
          demonstrated the highest mobility among these three
          substitution mutants, was not found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ΔA54</TIMEX> homing
          products. It remains elusive how the sequences were
          changed at positions surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point and why
          only C, along with wild-type A, were selected at the
          branch-point, despite the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A54G</ENAMEX> was slightly
          better than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A54C</TIMEX> in mobility (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional combinations of mutants were made. One
          containing deletions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DII</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)a,b and the κ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">190-204</ENAMEX>) that resulted in an intron that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">710</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nts</ENAMEX> in size, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one containing an additional
          deletion of domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ib</ENAMEX>, which resulted in a reduction to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">694 nts.</TIMEX> However, both constructs exhibited no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The largest deletions that preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ll</ENAMEX>.LtrB intron
        mobility were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> nt deletion in domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>) and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> nt deletion in domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX>. The smallest derivative
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ll</ENAMEX>.LtrB intron that retained mobility was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">725</NUMEX> nts,
        resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DII</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)a,b deletions
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.23%</NUMEX>). The tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> whose deletion does not
        completely abolish mobility are alpha, kappa and eta. Only
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3A</NUMEX> substitution mutant in the catalytic triad of DV
        was mobile, while the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were revertants
        back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. In DVI</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point nucleotide was found to
        be essential for mobility. It was also observed that any
        nucleotide at this position supported mobility to some
        extent.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Bacterial strains
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli HMS174</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>) was used for the genetic mobility assay. The
          cloning strain was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DH5α</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Construction of mutants
          Intron deletions were made by overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and
          cloned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor plasmid</ENAMEX> pACD2 (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] for
          details). This plasmid carries a ΔORF+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> version of the
          intron that contains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIV</ENAMEX> (from which
          the tetracycline resistance - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R gene is expressed after homing
          takes place). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LtrA</ENAMEX> is also expressed from the donor
          plasmid, but at a downstream location, outside the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX>. In this study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor plasmid</ENAMEX> has been further
          modified to contain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> nucleotide deletion in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIVb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>). It must be noted here that part of the DIVb
          helix substructure is maintained by the insertion of the
          T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
          Domain I deletions that were upstream of the 
          Bsr <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> site (intron position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX>),
          were cloned using the 
          Hin dIII and 
          Bsr <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> sites on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor plasmid</ENAMEX>.
          Deletions downstream of the 
          Bsr <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> site and the point mutants
          were cloned using the 
          Bsr <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> and 
          Pst I sites. All mutants were
          verified by sequencing.
        
        
          Mobility assay
          The genetic mobility assay was performed essentially
          as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guo</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          In brief, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor plasmids</ENAMEX> (carrying the mutant or
          wild-type introns) were each co-transformed with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recipient plasmid pBRR3</ENAMEX>, carrying a promoterless 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R gene downstream of the target
          site (which are the ligated exons; positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-30/</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).
          After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> induction (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μM</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>) and plating
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ampicillin</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg/ml</ENAMEX>) ± tetracycline (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25 μg/ml</ENAMEX>)
          plates, mobility events were identified as 
          amp 
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tet</ENAMEX> 
          R <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. It is important to note
          that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LtrA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overproduced</ENAMEX> in this assay, which might mask more subtle
          effects of these mutations.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were picked from each of the
          selection plates and tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to confirm true homing
          events. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers used were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rsense</ENAMEX> (recipient
          plasmid primer) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCACA-3</ENAMEX>' and LtrBAs2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">intron primer</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTCTCCTACAGATTGTACAAATGTGG-3</ENAMEX>'. In the
          case of deletions Id3(i)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and Id4</TIMEX>, the intron primer used
          was LtrBAs3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GATTCTCGGCATCGCTTTCG-3</ENAMEX>'.
          All positive homing products were isolated and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to verify the deletion. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DV</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVI</ENAMEX> revertants, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> plasmids from the PCR positive
          homing events were also isolated and sequenced to verify
          the mutation. True homing events were identified based on
          all of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tests - selection on plates containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ampicillin</ENAMEX> and tetracycline, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> verification
          and sequencing.
