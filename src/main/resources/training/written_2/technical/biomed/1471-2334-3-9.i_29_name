        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smallpox</ENAMEX>, while not found in the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at
        present, remains a potential health hazard especially due
        to the possibility of its use as a bioweapon [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ]
        . There is currently no accepted treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>,
        although a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have been evaluated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Therefore, new therapeutic or virucidal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> could have
        great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in slowing both the progression and spread of
        the disease in an epidemic situation. In the present study,
        we have investigated the potential of porphyrins (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Por</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phthalocyanines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pc</ENAMEX>) to prevent infection by vaccinia virus
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porphyrins</ENAMEX> and phthalocyanines
          Porphyrins were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midcentury Chemicals</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontier Scientific</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>)
          and used as received. Porphyrin designations are as
          follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX>, protoporphyrin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP</ENAMEX>, hematoporphyrin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>, 
          meso -tetraphenylporphine; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNapPS</ENAMEX>,
          sulfonated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,10,15,20-tetra-naphthalen-1-yl-porphyrin</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAnthPS</ENAMEX>, sulfonated
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,10,15,20-tetra-anthracen-9-yl-porphyrin</NUMEX>. Other
          porphyrins are tetraphenylporphyrin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>, e.g.,
          TPP2F is tetraphenylporphyrin with a fluoro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-position on each phenyl ring. An "S" at the end of the
          name indicates that the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">porphyrin</ENAMEX> was sulfonated.
          In most cases, these are mixtures with variable numbers
          of sulfonates and/or positions of the sulfonates on the
          ring. The sulfonated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper phthalocyanine</ENAMEX> [sold as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CuPcS</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>"<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>"')] was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldrich</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cell lines and virus strains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSC-40</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-143B</ENAMEX> cells were maintained in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium (DMEM) supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were utilized for virus
          titer determinations and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-143B</ENAMEX> cells were used in
          virus stock preparations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S3</ENAMEX> cells were grown at
          37Â°C in RPMI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX> culture medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin.
        
        
          Growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus (VV)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus (VV) were used in this
          study: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Reserve</ENAMEX> (WR) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Health</ENAMEX>
          Department-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX>) strains. The WR strain, produced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virotech International</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>), was a gift from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Feinberg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory University</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> strain
          was grown as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-143B</ENAMEX> cells,
          grown in roller bottles, were infected with the WR strain
          of the virus and incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. The cells
          were collected, resuspended in a buffered solution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 9</ENAMEX>) and homogenized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> strokes in a
          Dounce homogenizer. Large debris and nuclei were
          sedimented by centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. The
          supernatant was collected and trypsin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>) added.
          This was then loaded on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> sucrose cushion and the
          virus pelleted by centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,500</NUMEX> rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> min
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SW28</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rotor</ENAMEX>. Extracellular particles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> were obtained by infecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-143B</ENAMEX> cells. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, the culture medium was pre-cleared
          and the virus was concentrated by centrifugation at
          13,500 rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 min</TIMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SW28</NUMEX> rotor and resuspended in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 9</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection
          A plaque assay was used to determine the ability of
          test compounds to prevent infection. Compound stock
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">solutions, 5 mg/mL</ENAMEX>, were diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> and mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> particles to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> final
          concentrations: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 and 0.08 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> (in the dark) the virus-drug mixture was
          diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> (without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î¼L</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼L</ENAMEX> added to each well of confluent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1</ENAMEX> or BSC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> cells
          grown in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well plates. This afforded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pfu</ENAMEX>/well (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã—
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 -3pfu/cell</ENAMEX>). Following virus-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> adsorption onto the
          monolayer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell monolayers</ENAMEX> were washed twice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> to remove residual virus-drug mixture. New growth
          medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> was then added to each
          well.
          A plaque assay was used to determine the quantity of
          infectious particles remaining after drug treatment. Two
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after infection, the growth medium was removed and
          the cells washed twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. A solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          crystal violet, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> in phosphate buffered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) was then added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>
          incubation, the stain was removed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> washed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and allowed to dry. The number of plaques was
          then determined and activity calculated based on the
          reduction in average number of plaques, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> where
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> was pre-incubated with the virus, compared
          to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> inoculated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">untreated virus</ENAMEX>. As
          an alternative to the liquid overlay, agar overlays were
          also investigated. Similar results were obtained with
          both assays. Hence, further plaque assays were done using
          liquid overlays.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values were calculated as response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">= min +</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">max-min</ENAMEX>)/(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exp</ENAMEX>(log[drug]-logEC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> )] using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaleidagraph</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synergy</ENAMEX>
          Software, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reading</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>). Reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values are the average and standard
          deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate determinations, each
          replicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times.
        
        
          Inhibition of virus yield
          Confluent monolayers of CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were infected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Ã— 10 5pfu/</ENAMEX>well (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pfu</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>.
          The cells were then washed twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> to remove any
          residual virus. Compound stock solutions, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 mg/mL</ENAMEX>, were
          diluted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> to final concentrations of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 or 25 Î</TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/mL.</ENAMEX> This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼L</ENAMEX>)
          was then added to the cells. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> h post-infection, cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monolayers</ENAMEX> and culture medium were harvested and
          subjected to several cycles of freeze/thawing to release
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extracellular</ENAMEX> virus particles. A plaque
          assay on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1 cells</ENAMEX> was used to determine the virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titer</ENAMEX>. CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were infected with the virus inoculum
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h; the growth medium was removed and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> added to the cells. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, the cells were
          washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and later stained with a solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          crystal violet, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and the viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">plaque</ENAMEX> number was counted. To determine if viral
          inactivation occurs after cell lysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> monolayers
          were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> to remove the compounds
          then harvested and subjected to several cycles of
          freeze/thawing to release intracellular virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cell proliferation assay
          Cell proliferation was measured by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-thymidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . HeLa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S3 cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 10 4cells/well</ENAMEX>) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates in the presence of varying
          concentrations of the tetrapyrroles for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>,
          after which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H-TdR</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼Ci/well</ENAMEX>) was added. The cells were
          further incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 h</TIMEX>, then harvested and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-TdR
          incorporation monitored by using a liquid scintillation
          counter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are from a single experiment.
        
        
          Cytotoxicity of active tetrapyrroles
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1</ENAMEX> and BSC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> cells were seeded at a concentration
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 Ã— 10 4cells</NUMEX>/well in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate and allowed to
          attach <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, after which they were ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> confluent.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compounds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> were added to the cells.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, a trypan blue viability assay [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] was
          performed. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> cytotoxic concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ) is the concentration required to
          reduce viable cell numbers by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> relative to untreated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cell numbers. This was determined by incubation
          in growth medium containing serial dilutions of compounds
          in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 - 2000 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, after which
          the viable cell numbers were determined. To determine the
          effect of the compounds on cell proliferation, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h
          incubation, the cells were washed and further incubated
          in the absence of the compounds for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 day</TIMEX>, and then a
          trypan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue assay</ENAMEX> was done. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are from a single
          experiment.
        
        
          Cytostatic activity
          CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were seeded at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 3cells/well (in
          growth medium) in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate and allowed to attach
          overnight; the compounds (in growth medium) were then
          added. Following a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 h incubation</NUMEX>, the cells were
          counted.
        
      
      
        Results
        Initial screening of porphyrins and phthalocyanines
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> different compounds.
        These compounds were pre-incubated with the virus and then
        the mixture was inoculated on CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells and residual virus
        titers were determined by plaque assay. Based on the
        results obtained, we were able to determine the most active
        compounds, that is, compounds at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> Î¼g/mL that inactivated
        the virus completely (no plaques seen) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These
        were chosen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for further study.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porphyrins</ENAMEX> (based on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protoporphyrin</ENAMEX> ring skeleton of hemin) were evaluated. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with the hematoporphyrin ring (i.e.,
        hydroxyethyl <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-positions, see CuHPIX
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were found to be more active than structures
        with the protoporphyrin (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZnPPIX</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
        mesoporphyrin, deuteroporphyrin or deuteroporphyrin
        disulfonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> rings (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethyl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> or sulfonate at
        positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 4</TIMEX>, respectively). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CuHPIX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZnPPIX</ENAMEX> were
        evaluated in more detail. CuHPIX was more active than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZnPPIX</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.7</NUMEX> Î¼g/mL for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1 cells</ENAMEX>)] but neither was as active as the
        sulfonated porphyrins ( 
        vide infra ). The ability of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> to prevent infection was also compared in BSC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        cells. Generally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50</ENAMEX> data obtained from both cell lines
        were of the same order of magnitude; however, in the BSC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        cell line, the WR strain of the virus showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>-fold
        greater sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CuHPIX</ENAMEX> as compared with CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        A large number of sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">derivatives</ENAMEX> was also evaluated. A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> metal
        chelates of tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TPPS4</NUMEX>) was
        tested, but none showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> activity at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>
        using either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> strains; these candidates
        therefore were not pursued. A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        tetraphenylporphyrin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> made via sulfonation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Br</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-F</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cl</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-F</ENAMEX> and Cl
        tetraphenylporphyrins was evaluated. Many of these
        derivatives completely blocked infection by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> at
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). TPP2ClS and TPP2FS
        were studied in more detail. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> derivatives had
        similar activities (within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> assays. A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfonated</ENAMEX> derivatives of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-difluoro and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-dichlorotetraphenylporphyrins was also
        studied. The parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) chelate of
        the difluoroporphyrin completely inhibited infection at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) chelate had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX> (CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.74 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSC-40</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> assay and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.44 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL (CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested were less active, i.e.,
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> Î¼g/mL, they inactivated the virus by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> non-halogenated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porphyrin</ENAMEX> derivatives with aryl side

        high activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). All of these had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 5 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX> in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNapS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAnthS</ENAMEX> were more active against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX>
        than WR strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1 cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]
        also had high activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.17</NUMEX> (CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BSC-40</ENAMEX>) Î¼g/mL for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> assay; and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.7</NUMEX> (CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX> (BSC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] is a
        neutral compound with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>);
        this may give it amphiphilic properties that could play a
        role in blocking infection.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> sulfonated phthalocyanines (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcS</ENAMEX>) were
        evaluated. Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and chromium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcS</ENAMEX> were able to
        inhibit viral infection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> phthalocyanine
        sulfonate only had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL in the WR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> in both cell lines. It was somewhat more active in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> assays, but the sulfonated phthalocyanines were
        not studied further.
        Since there are major differences in surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX>,
        and presumably in the host cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> and extracellular particles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] , we also compared the sensitivity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms to
        the compounds to be tested. Generally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested
        were highly effective against both forms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Comparison of the intracellular mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">virion</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMV</ENAMEX>, third
        column in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV)
        forms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> strain showed differences in activity of
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> in blocking infection by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>. These results suggest that the tetrapyrroles may
        be binding to different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> on the surface of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of the virus and thus show differences in
        efficiency of preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection.
        The active compounds exhibited very low to moderate
        toxicity in assays for their effects on cell viability
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Therapeutic ratios, calculated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">50 /EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> , were found to be in a range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>
        - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZnPPIX</ENAMEX>, for which the ratios
        were in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - 3</ENAMEX>. The compounds were also tested
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1 cells</ENAMEX> and a human cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HeLaS3</NUMEX>) for their
        effect on cell growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested
        generally inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV-1</ENAMEX> cell growth at high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine uptake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> only at concentrations above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL except for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F2</NUMEX>)S (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 < 5 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>).
        The ability of a number of tetrapyrroles to inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus replication</ENAMEX> was determined in CV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells infected
        with the WR strain in the absence of compounds. Following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus adsorption</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 h</ENAMEX>), compounds in growth medium were
        added to the cells. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> h post-infection, cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> were collected, virus was released by freezing and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thawing</ENAMEX> and virus yields determined by plaque assay.
        Reduction of virus yield was observed with all compounds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), with most compounds resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> -
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> reduction at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 Î¼g/mL.</ENAMEX> These results indicate that
        infectious virus production is being inhibited by these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX>.
        These results were compared to those of other
        experiments in which the compounds were removed before
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">titration</ENAMEX> was done (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The effect on viral
        yield was found to be significantly reduced when the
        compounds were removed prior to harvest, indicating that
        the inhibitory effect occurs predominantly after viral
        release. Using a lower moi (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pfu</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>), and removing
        the compounds before the viral harvest resulted in
        reduction of viral yields by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 98%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>),
        indicating that the compounds block multiple cycle
        replication of the virus. Inhibition of virus spread by
        these compounds has also been observed when the
        tetrapyrroles were included in the overlay medium in a
        plaque assay. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">44 h</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell monolayers</ENAMEX> were stained
        and the plaque numbers determined. We observed substantial
        reductions in plaque numbers and size (data not shown)
        indicating inhibition of both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection and
        spread.
      
      
        Discussion
        Photoinactivation of viruses by diamagnetic porphyrins
        and phthalocyanines has been widely studied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Photoactivation involves absorption of
        light by the tetrapyrrole with resulting production of free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> and singlet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>. In the current study,
        inhibition of vaccinia infection is not due to
        photoactivation of the tetrapyrroles, as shown by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        aspects of the experiments. First, there was little
        exposure to light during experiments, with no additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we observed that the extent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> was not a function of the spin state
        (diamagnetic or paramagnetic) for metal chelates of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porphyrins</ENAMEX> and phthalocyanines. Only diamagnetic
        tetrapyrroles are able to inhibit viruses via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoinactivation</ENAMEX>; the excited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the paramagnetic
        derivatives have short half-lives and do not give
        significant amounts of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">singlet oxygen</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrapyrroles</ENAMEX> previously have been reported to inhibit
        certain other viruses by mechanisms not involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoactivation</ENAMEX>. A cationic phthalocyanine was reported to
        inhibit human rhinovirus type 5 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porphyrin</ENAMEX> derivatives inhibit specific viral
        targets including retroviral reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 protease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        In previous studies of the antiviral effects of
        porphyrins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Song et</ENAMEX> al. investigated the antiviral effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX> 
        
        meso -tetrakis(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>-disulfonatomesityl)porphyrin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FeTMPS</ENAMEX>), and 
        meso -tetra(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-carboxyphenyl</ENAMEX>)porphyrin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPPC</ENAMEX>) and its iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel chelates</ENAMEX> for a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        50 s were generally <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL or greater
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSV</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSV-1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coxsackie</ENAMEX> virus B4 and
        poliovirus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. FeTMPS showed activity in this range also for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semliki</ENAMEX> forest virus.
        FeTMPS was more active for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sindbis</ENAMEX> virus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VZV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        50 s of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 25</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/mL.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX> TPPC
        were also quite active against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porphyrins</ENAMEX> and metalloporphyrins have also been shown to
        have antiviral activity against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Previous studies indicated
        that some porphyrins inhibit the interaction between the
        virus envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 31 32 33 34</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . We have shown also that porphyrins block
        infection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> and that this activity appears to be a
        result of an interaction with the envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        In this regard, the compounds that were active in blocking
        infection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> tended to be sulfonated compounds or
        other negatively charged compounds. In the present study,
        it is of interest that the uncharged molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] was one of the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested.
        This result indicates that the activity of this compound
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VV</ENAMEX> is not merely a reflection of an interaction
        between a negatively charged molecule and positively
        charged sites on the viral surface, but that other
        structural features are important for interaction with
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> strains exhibited similar
        sensitivity to most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested, some
        differences in their relative sensitivity was observed. The
        WR strain was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3- to 6</NUMEX>-fold less sensitive than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IHD-J</ENAMEX> to
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAnthPS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CuHPIX</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TPP2FS</ENAMEX>,
        but was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX>-fold more sensitive to inhibition by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPP</ENAMEX>[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. These results support the conclusion that
        the compounds block infection by interacting with specific
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>(s), and that strain-specific differences in
        protein structures determine the differences in
        sensitivities to specific compounds. The sensitivity of the
        activity to relatively small structural changes in our work
        indicates either that amphiphilicity and steric and
        specific axial ligand effects significantly control binding
        to the virion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, or that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> mechanism of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> is operational.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50</ENAMEX> data obtained from both viruses
        studied ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05 to 40 Î¼M</NUMEX>. This range is comparable
        to that observed for other compounds active against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccinia</ENAMEX>. For example, cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside
        with activity against a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>, used
        clinically in some instances [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , has been shown to be
        effective against a number of poxviruses with the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 values: 2.3 Î¼M</TIMEX> (camelpox), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46.2 Î</NUMEX>¼M
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">vaccinia</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 Î¼M</NUMEX> (monkeypox) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58 Î¼M</NUMEX> (cowpox) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ]
        . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of compounds have been tested for their
        effectiveness against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus including the IMP
        dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 4 - 100 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMP</ENAMEX> decarboxylase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/mL</ENAMEX>), and polyanionic compounds
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/mL</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        In conclusion, we observed that both porphyrins and
        phthalocyanines have substantial antiviral activity against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus. Examples of the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porphyrin</ENAMEX>,
        sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin, neutral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetraphenylporphyrin</ENAMEX> and sulfonated phthalocyanine classes
        were all found to be active. These results, as well as the
        high therapeutic ratios observed, indicate that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> represent attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> as antiviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to control poxvirus infection.
