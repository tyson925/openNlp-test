        For the development of an all-encompassing potential
        energy function for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> folding problem that can
        simulate both the thermodynamic and kinetic processes, it
        is argued that one must start from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> principles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, given the complexity of the problem, involving
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of atoms and an extremely large number of
        conformations available to these atoms, the available
        computational power posses a serious restriction.
        Alternatively, one could use the available experimental
        results to develop empirical potential functions using a
        simplified representation for the system which does not
        require an explicit enumeration of the entire system. Here,
        we present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such simplified method to train a potential
        energy function using a small set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which places
        a significant number of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> conformations
        near its minima.
        Ideally, we would like to obtain a potential energy
        function which assigns correct free energy to the native
        and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, this
        requires knowing the complete distribution of energy states
        and total number of degeneracies for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and
        denatured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, quantities which are not readily
        available even for a simplified representation of our
        system. This has led to design of potential functions with
        restricted objectives.
        Knowledge-based potentials are obtained from a survey of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein crystal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. In this case, there is no
        training of parameters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue-residue interaction</ENAMEX> can
        be defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> vs. no-contact type [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] or,
        alternatively, can also be defined as distance dependent [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . The resulting potentials depend upon the training
        set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, reference <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and the functional form [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas and Dill</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] have pointed out that these
        potential functions do not assign the correct value to the
        energy parameters, though they do rank them correctly.
        On the other hand, the potential parameters are
        explicitly trained in the optimization-based methods. In
        these cases, the goal is to obtain a potential function
        which either maximizes the difference between the native
        and average non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> state energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ),
        maximizes the ratio of folding to glass transition
        temperatures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] or requires that all the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> be
        of energy higher than the native [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Here, the native
        state is represented by a single conformation. While the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches provide reasonable results, they do
        not guarantee complete success in terms of fold recognition
        even for the training set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A somewhat better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> is to require that all the non-native
        conformations have energy higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>. In this
        case, if the energy function is chosen such that the total
        energy of the conformation is a linear function of its
        adjustable parameters, then the problem can be stated as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> programming problem with a suitable objective
        function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> factors that govern the training of a
        potential function using optimization-based methods: (i)
        representation of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) choice of the
        interaction energy function, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) training set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) generation of the alternative conformations
        or decoys and (v) the objective function.
        The representation of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> depends upon the
        amount of atomic-level detail one wishes to incorporate in
        the calculations, starting from a single point per residue
        representation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] to an all-heavy atom
        representation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . As more and more details are
        included, the complexity of the calculations increases;
        however, a coarse-grained <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can not be expected to
        produce very refined structure predictions. While the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lattice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have usually stayed with single point
        representation, the continuous state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have used
        different variations from a single point per residue to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom representation.
        The choice of the interaction energy function to some
        extent depends upon the physical property of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        which is deemed important, as well as on the type of amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid representation</ENAMEX> used. The most commonly used pairwise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-residue interactions can be treated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX>/no
        contact [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 22</NUMEX> ] , discrete distance ranges [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 23</NUMEX>
        ] , and continuously varying functions of distance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 24 25</NUMEX> ] . The energy function should be flexible enough
        without causing overfitting. While having more parameters
        does provide the flexibility, having too many of them is
        not always helpful, as seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] where a
        80,000 parameter potential performed worse than a simple
        contact type function. Such discontinuous functions could
        also lead to problems if used for kinetic calculations or
        for local optimization. Furthermore, it has been shown that
        distance dependent energy functions perform better than
        contact type in a continuous conformation space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Furthermore, excluded-volume effects play an important
        role in the performance of a potential function. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">& Dill</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] have pointed out, one of the reasons for
        failure of the potential functions is the absence of any
        excluded-volume effects in the interaction energy models.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park & Levitt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] show that a van der
        Waals type energy function gives better results than
        contact type or solvation potential alone, and a
        combination of surface energy function with a van der Waals
        type energy function performs even better.
        Another crucial requirement for the development of
        potential functions using optimization-based methods is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of realistic and challenging decoys. A great
        deal depends upon the set of decoys used to define the
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. It has been demonstrated by various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19 26</NUMEX> ] that using a set of decoys
        obtained mostly by threading does not enforce a very
        stringent training criterion, and the potential functions
        so obtained fail to even place the training set native
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> near a local minimum, let alone the global
        minimum. Similarly, one can obtain low energy conformations
        by manipulation of conformations in a contact map
        representation, though this may lead to geometrically
        unrealizable conformations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Other methods which
        have been used to generate low energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">decoys</ENAMEX> include
        Monte-Carlo simulations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and molecular dynamics
        simulations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] , both of which require significant
        computation time, discretization of conformational
        variables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and inclusion of rigid pieces of
        structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        A necessary, though not sufficient, condition for a well
        behaved potential function is that the native conformation
        be at or near a minimum of the potential function. As
        pointed out earlier [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19 26</NUMEX> ] , the potential functions
        derived with mostly threaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> fail to satisfy
        this condition, even when a large set of conformations is
        used. The reason for such a failure is that the training
        conformations are fixed and not allowed to relax given a
        potential function. This results in most of the
        conformations being of significantly higher energy and only
        a small set of conformations end up providing an active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX> set. However, if the inactive conformations are
        allowed to relax, they would provide a much more stringent
        set of constraints and will improve the performance of the
        potential function significantly. In this work, we place a
        milder condition on the training by only asking that the
        native be near a local minimum. No condition is placed for
        the global minimum. We use energy minimization to generate
        new decoys which are physically realizable low energy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decoys</ENAMEX> and provide better training. Furthermore, a
        physically meaningful objective function is used during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadratic</ENAMEX> programming. Here we train a potential function
        using only a few single domain, monomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which do
        not require any hetero <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or ligands to stabilize their
        folded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> (using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ) and significantly different
        crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (average rmsd of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~11 √Ö</NUMEX>). Once trained,
        the potential function is able to place <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, even
        including some multi-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CASP3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">~4 √Ö</NUMEX> of the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native conformations</ENAMEX>.
        Here we present a method that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> a reasonably good
        potential function using only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIE</ENAMEX> function
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX> function, shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters
          per interaction type, hence a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> parameters.
          The potential function was so trained that when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native conformations</ENAMEX> of the training set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          energy minimized, the resulting local minimum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> is within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 √Ö</NUMEX> rmsd. For all choices of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          ‚â§ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G ‚â</ENAMEX>§ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60.0 and 0.05 ‚â§</NUMEX> œÅ 
          
            cut 
           ‚â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.25</NUMEX>, the potential was trainable, i.e., the
          potential function had enough flexibility that we did not
          run in to a situation where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX> could not come up with
          a solution, though at times solutions were suboptimal.
          The performance of these potential functions on the test
          set proteins varied greatly. In general high 
          G and low œÅ 
          
            cut 
           values resulted in a very rough energy surfaces
          which led to large energy changes for small
          conformational variations. On the other hand, low 
          G and high œÅ 
          
            cut 
           values resulted in a potential function that is too 
          flat and allows easy conformational
          changes. For these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we found that a value of 
          G = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> gave us the best results. This potential
          function (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIE3</NUMEX>) is able to place <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein native conformations</ENAMEX> to within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd of a
          local minimum (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> are between
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-12 √Ö</TIMEX> rmsd.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> function
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> function is very simple and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 21</NUMEX>
          adjustable parameters, one for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> and one for
          the overcrowding which prevents a complete collapse of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> as well as prevents any unrealistic chain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlaps</ENAMEX>. Once again, we used the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          used various combinations of 
          G and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           to obtain solutions. However, this time, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>
          function by itself, we failed to obtain a potential
          function even for a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, let alone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> together. As soon as the conformations were
          generated by energy minimization process, we obtained a
          set of inequalities which resulted in a null feasible
          solution <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX>. This shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> function
          by itself does not have enough flexibility to give a
          trained potential function when decoys are generated by
          more rigorous methods. Yet, this function was
          successfully trained by threading using experimental
          crystal structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> function
          As with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX>, the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are used for
          the training purposes. Since this is a sum of the other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> energy functions, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">920</NUMEX> parameters, the one
          parameter for overcrowding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> function having been
          removed since the 
          f 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX> function performs a
          similar function. Once again, we obtain various sets of
          trained parameters depending upon the value of 
          G and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           , and once again we find that 
          G = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> give the best results for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          In this case (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PSE3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> remain within
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 √Ö</NUMEX> rmsd and all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> are within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">~6 √Ö</NUMEX>. Considering that
          the test set contains both close homologs and
          significantly different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the training
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in terms of their size, sequence, and structure,
          this is a very encouraging result since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all 12</TIMEX> test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> remain within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6 √Ö</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~12</NUMEX> √Ö for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX>. It
          shows that using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> function, one can train a
          potential function using only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which would
          be applicable to many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The comparison
          between the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PSE3</ENAMEX> functions is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          The training for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PSE3</TIMEX> was performed using three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set A = {1ayi</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1bk2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1ubi}</ENAMEX>), none of which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contains Cys</ENAMEX>. However, there were many other interactions
          which remained untrained in the final version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PSE3</TIMEX>. To
          get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 300</NUMEX> pairwise interactions to train at least
          moderately, we had to either select larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which
          contain all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in sufficient number or enlarge the
          training set even if all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are not present in
          any one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Since computation time increases
          as square of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length, we chose to enlarge the
          training set using smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set B</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">{1enh, 1bk2, 2era, 1ubi}</ENAMEX>) contains all
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids collectively</ENAMEX>. However, in the final
          trained potential function (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PSE4</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the
          interactions still remain completely untrained. This set
          was then further expanded by including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set C</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">{1enh, 1bk2, 2era, 1ubi, 1ail, 1dsl}</ENAMEX>).
          The final trained potential function using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set C</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PSE6</NUMEX>)
          has all the pairwise interactions at least mildly
          trained. Set C contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1enh and 1ail</TIMEX>) with
          mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Œ±-helical structure</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1bk2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2era and 1dsl</TIMEX>)
          with mostly Œ≤-sheet structure and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1ubi</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Œ±</ENAMEX>/Œ≤
          structure. However, there is very little sequence
          identity between any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and their crystal

          The best results for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set B</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PSE4</NUMEX>) are obtained using

            cut 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>. The potential function PSE4 places <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> test set native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">~4 √Ö</NUMEX> of a
          local minimum (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) which is a significant
          improvement over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PSE3</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PSE4</NUMEX> was further applied to
          another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> native
          conformations were placed within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd of a local

          within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd. Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PSE4</TIMEX> places a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> (including the training set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) of
          very different sequences and crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to within
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 √Ö</NUMEX> rmsd of a local minimum out
          of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> proteins
          contains a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, some of which are
          multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d3b</TIMEX>) or require a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stabilization</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1cc5</TIMEX>).
          The best result for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set C</ENAMEX> (potential function PSE6
          with 
          G = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1</NUMEX> and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>) places <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> test set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to
          within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In all, out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> are within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6</NUMEX> √Ö
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> are within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4 √Ö</NUMEX> (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CASP3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>).
          The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PSE6</ENAMEX> is able to place <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd of a local minimum for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of very different sequences, crystal structures,
          and length points to the robustness of the potential
          function, and, therefore, the usefulness of the
          approach.
        
        
          Threading test
          To further test the validity and usefulness of the
          final potential function <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PSE6</TIMEX>, we performed an ungapped
          threading test using all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We first energy
          minimized each of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> and obtained
          the conformation of the local minimum using potential
          PSE6. These local minimum conformations were then used as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decoys</ENAMEX> during ungapped threading tests for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          The threaded conformations were not energy minimized. In
          the threading test, instead of the usual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> point
          representation for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, we use a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> point
          representation for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, since the potential PSE6
          has been trained using this representation. Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native conformations</ENAMEX> are ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
          the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1dsl, 1snc</ENAMEX>) are ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. This test
          is conducted using a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180,878</NUMEX> decoys. Therefore,
          we see that a potential function trained using the
          procedure outlined in this work also performs well when
          subjected to the threading test, whereas the potentials
          designed using only threaded conformations do not perform
          well when decoys are generated using energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimization</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the drawbacks of this procedure is that the
          training process is not sequential and, therefore, quite
          time consuming, i.e., addition of inequalities for a new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> after the training for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is complete
          does not necessarily give better results. Any change in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> set, 
          G , œÅ 
          
            cut 
           or any other strategy change requires starting all
          over again, since the set of conformations generated for
          the training are based on the current set of parameters,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, the process is memory dependent. However, given
          that the potential energy surface is of very high
          dimension and highly irregular, it is to be expected.
          By only considering the energy minimization of the
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native conformation</ENAMEX>, we reduce the amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> required to train the potential function. Each
          potential function could be trained within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> running
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> workstations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPU</ENAMEX> speeds: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHz-450</ENAMEX> MHz).
          However, we had to perform many training runs to get the
          best possible potential function for each set, and at
          this point it guarantees only the local minimum condition
          for the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, not the global one.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        A necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the
        stability of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is that the
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> conformation be at or near a minimum of
        the potential function. We show that by using only a small
        set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, potential functions can be trained that
        put a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> near a local minimum of
        the potential function. While this does not guarantee the
        stability of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, this does ensure that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native conformation</ENAMEX> is not sitting at highly unstable
        points on the potential surface, a condition which is
        encountered in other potential functions. Our best
        potential function (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PSE6</NUMEX>) obtained using training Set C
        (containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) is able to place a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        native conformations to within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> native
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> to within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6</NUMEX> √Ö rmsd of a local minimum of the
        potential function out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We also find
        that while the pairwise interaction energy function is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trainable</ENAMEX> using the more rigorously generated decoys, the
        solvation potential alone is not. The solvation potential
        has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 21</NUMEX> adjustable parameters and can not provide
        enough flexibility to satisfy all the constraints in our
        case, though it was trainable using threaded conformations
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX>. The best results are obtained using the pairwise
        energy function in combination with the solvation energy
        function. We further test the final potential function PSE6
        with threaded conformations for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and find that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> are ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and the
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. The training process is
        further improved by the use of a physically meaningful
        quantity for the objective function in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX> optimization
        which helps in identifying a better solution.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of native structure
          For the purposes of training, we select only single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, monomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which do not require any
          hetero atoms or ligands for their stabilization in the
          folded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the atom positions are
          available for the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> heavy atoms and at least the
          corresponding C 
          Œ≤ atom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. The crystal
          structures (obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ) for the protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> are fitted to a standard geometry continuous state
          model (very similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dill</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ). In the fitted
          model, each side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is represented by a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interacting</ENAMEX> site, located at the C 
          Œ≤ , while keeping all the main chain
          heavy atoms, i.e., each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is represented by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (united atom types). Standard values
          for bond lengths and bond angles are used, and all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> bonds are kept in the trans conformation. Thus,
          only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">torsion angles (œÜ</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">œà</NUMEX>) are allowed to vary between
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180¬∞ and 180¬∞</NUMEX>. The details of the fitting procedure are
          described in ref. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> and will not be repeated here. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitted</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 √Ö</NUMEX> rmsd [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] of the PDB
          structure and is used as the native <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in our
          calculations. Thus, the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is a single energy,
          non-degenerate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in our calculations.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> decoys
          The conformations of the non-native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decoys</ENAMEX> are
          generated using the following procedures, (i)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parameter-Independent Decoys</ENAMEX>: Starting from the native
          conformation, all pairs of torsional angles are perturbed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-30¬∞ ‚â§ Œ¥ ‚â§ 30¬∞</ENAMEX> at a time. For example, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> torsion angles and, therefore,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4950</TIMEX> pairs of torsional angles. This would give us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4950</TIMEX>
          different decoys, but see the Solution Procedure section
          for the precise protocol used. These conformations do not
          depend upon the current potential function, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parameter-Dependent Decoys</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native conformation</ENAMEX> is
          energy minimized with respect to torsion angles using the
          current potential function.
        
        
          Energy functions
          Since we generate conformations by energy minimization
          with respect to the torsion angles which are allowed to
          change continuously, we also need an energy function that
          is a continuous and differentiable function of angles. We
          use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different types of energy functions: the
          pairwise interaction energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIE</ENAMEX>) function, the solvation
          energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>) function, and the pairwise interaction with
          solvation energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>) function. In our case, all these
          functions are continuous functions of separation between
          atoms and, therefore, the conformations can be energy
          minimized with respect to torsion angles to generate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decoys</ENAMEX> once we use the standard geometric representation
          for the conformations.
        
        
          Pairwise interaction energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIE</ENAMEX>) function
          The pairwise interaction between a pair of atoms is
          represented by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          
          where

          x 
          
            ij 
           is the distance between united atoms 
          i and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . The function

           (

            ij 
           ) is defined over a limited distance interval as
          follows:
          
          where 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>,

            ij 
           ), provides some steric repulsion for atoms sitting
          too close to each other and its coefficient is always
          fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> which prevents a complete collapse of the
          chain. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> functions have adjustable
          coefficients which are allowed to vary <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between -20</NUMEX> and

          Parameter adjustment using quadratic
          programming
          Given the above energy functions, the total energy of
          any conformation is a linear function of the adjustable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, irrespective of the energy function being
          used. This property allows us to use quadratic
          programming (QP) to adjust the values of these
          parameters. We choose the following objective function
          for the optimization purposes:
          
          where Œ± 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>  is the sum of the
          coefficients of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          
            p 
           parameters 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           when the derivative of the energy of a conformation
          is evaluated at the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. While the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term
          minimizes the gradient of the energy with respect to
          dihedral angles at the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX> for all
          training set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term keeps the values
          of parameters small to reduce the roughness of the energy
          surface. Having a continuous energy function is essential
          for using such a physically meaningful objective
          function. By minimizing the magnitude of the gradient of
          energy of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX>, we obtain a set of
          parameters such that the native conformation approximates
          a stationary point of the potential function. The total
          number of parameters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          
            P 
           depends upon the type of energy function is being
          used, namely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIE</ENAMEX> function, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>
          function, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">920</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> function. The constraints
          are of the form

          where 
          G and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           are adjustable constants. If œÅ < œÅ 
          
            cut 
           , we consider the decoy to be conformationally
          identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and no inequality is generated
          even if the energy of the decoy is lower than that of the
          native. The constants 
          G and œÅ 
          
            cut 
           define the minimum energy separation between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and decoys, and the radius of the basin of the
          native, respectively. They may be changed from one
          training run to another; however, not during the same
          training run. Here, œÅ is given by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
          
          where 
          R 
          
            gj 
           is the radius of gyration of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> thconformation and 
          D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX> is the customary root mean square
          deviation in C 
          Œ± coordinates after optimal
          superposition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conformations, taken to be the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and an alternate. By allowing 
          g to vary linearly with œÅ near the
          native structure, we avoid sudden jumps in the potential
          energy surface and keep the variation in the energy
          function smooth near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>. Finally, we need to
          provide bounds on our parameters, and we have chosen 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> for all

           's which multiply 
          f

          so that we are able to find a feasible solution while
          keeping most of the parameters away from the extreme
          values. Due to the choice of , we use quadratic
          programming (QP) instead of linear programming to solve
          the set of inequalities. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
        
        
          Solution procedure
          We obtain the initial set of parameters by minimizing
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX>. The decoys are generated using the methods
          described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. First, the decoys are generated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbing</ENAMEX> pairs of torsion angles by an amount Œ¥. For a
          chain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n -1</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX> such pairs. Even for a
          chain with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, this would produce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4950</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX>. Initially, since the parameter set is
          completely untrained, a large number of inequalities are
          generated for a training set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          ranging in length from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. To keep the number
          of inequalities to a reasonable value, we first perturb
          pairs of angles separated by a certain number of covalent
          bonds 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and its multiples. For example,
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass, we change the pair of angles separated
          by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> covalent bonds or multiples
          of it, i.e., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 18, 27</TIMEX>, etc. In this case, starting from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> torsion angle from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>, we perturb
          pairs of angles located at (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX> ) positions along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> where
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k ‚â</ENAMEX>§ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">l = 0, 1, 2,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">etc</ENAMEX>, collect all the inequalities
          and run them through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX> to obtain a new set of
          parameters. Next, we take pairs of angles separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          backbone bonds and add new inequalities to the previous
          set and obtain a new set of parameters by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX>. This
          process is repeated for pairs of angles separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and zero backbone bonds. Next, we repeat this process
          for all pairs of angles by perturbing them by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Œ¥ ¬± 2¬∞, Œ¥</ENAMEX> ¬±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4¬∞ and Œ¥ ¬± 6¬∞</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">12¬∞ ‚â§ |Œ¥| ‚â§ 20¬∞</ENAMEX>. This is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of decoys.
          The next step is parameter dependent generation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decoys</ENAMEX>. Here, we use energy minimization of native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> (using 
          BFGS method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] ) to generate
          new decoys. During each cycle, we begin from the native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> and energy minimize the conformations with
          respect to the torsion angles. After every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimization</ENAMEX> steps, the conformational distance of the
          current conformation from the native is calculated in
          terms of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">œÅ</NUMEX>. If the œÅ value is greater than the cutoff
          value œÅ 
          cut , we say that the current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> is sufficiently different from the native
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, i.e., it does not belong to the basin of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX>, and
          since the energy of this conformation is lower than the
          native, a new constraint is generated. After complete
          minimization of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX>, if any new
          inequalities are generated, they are added to the set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequalities</ENAMEX> and a new set of parameters is obtained by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QP</ENAMEX>. If no new inequalities are generated, then the
          training is complete and a trained potential has been
          obtained. To keep the number of inequalities within a
          manageable limit, we periodically discard inequalities
          corresponding to nonnatives having energy significantly
          higher than the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, i.e., having high slack
          value greater than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> for the current parameter set.
          Initially, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> and slowly reduced
          to 200.
