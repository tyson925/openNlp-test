          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of blind protein structure
          prediction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-wide experiment on methods to test
          protein structure prediction (CASP) was first initiated
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, as a means of evaluating structure prediction
          methods in a blind and rigourous manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This was
          motivated in part by claims in the literature of the
          protein folding problem being "solved" without producing
          tangible benefits, since most of the "solutions" included
          a strong dependence on the test set. These experiments
          evaluate prediction techniques by asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modellers</ENAMEX> to
          construct models for a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences before
          the experimental result is known, over a period of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. We have taken part in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments,
          including the most recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CASP4</NUMEX>) that finished in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">December 2000 http://predictioncenter.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">llnl</ENAMEX>.gov. The CASP4
          results provide a benchmark as to what level of model
          accuracy we can currently expect from our approaches.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary categories of methods for
          predicting protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from sequence: comparative
          modelling, fold recognition, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction. In the
          comparative modelling and fold recognition categories,
          the methodologies rely on the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          evolutionarily related template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that
          are used to construct a model; the evolutionary
          relationship can be deduced from sequence similarity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] or by "threading" a sequence against a library of
          structures and selecting the best match [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . For
          both of these approaches, a sequence alignment between
          the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to be modelled and the evolutionarily
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with known structure is used to create
          the initial or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> model. In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio category, there is no
          strong dependence on database information and prediction
          methods are based on general principles that govern
          protein structure and energetics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . The
          categories vary in difficulty, and consequently methods
          in each of these categories produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with different
          levels of accuracy relative to the experimental
          structures.
          Since the inception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX>, predictors all over the
          world have built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodologies</ENAMEX> described above. Before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CASP
          experiment, published results in comparative modelling in
          the literature usually were obtained by applying
          structure prediction methods in the context of the exact
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>; for example, re-building side
          chains on the native main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, or re-building regions
          of main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> keeping the rest of the experimental
          structure fixed. (This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> continues to this day.) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio methodologies,
          parameterised extensively on small test sets, failed when
          given novel types of sequences.
          CASP1 was an eye-opener in terms of understanding the
          difficulty of making accurate predictions on approximate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX> in comparative modelling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The main
          problems in creating a good comparative or fold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were related to alignment between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> and target sequences, and building of
          non-conserved variable regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, and main
          chain loops). In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio category, it appeared
          that methods could not sample conformational space
          accurately, and select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>-like conformations, for all
          but very small fragments. The highlight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CASP1</ENAMEX> was the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of threading as viable method for predicting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folds</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neural-network</ENAMEX> based
          secondary structure prediction methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CASP showed some improvement in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas:
          In comparative modelling, loops were being built better,
          and the use of hand-inspected alignments greatly
          increased model accuracy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In the fold recognition
          category, alignments as well as prediction of folds
          improved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The results in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio category remained
          virtually unchanged except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> model of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-helical protein</ENAMEX> NK-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysin</ENAMEX> predicted to within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> Ã…
          C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>, capturing the correct topology
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> CASP saw consistent but little progress
          relative to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CASP2</NUMEX> in both comparative modelling and fold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> categories [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , but the most dramatic
          results were observed in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio category. Here multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> predicted large parts of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
          at a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> topological level (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â‰ˆ 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Performance of our methods at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CASP1-3: Comparative</ENAMEX>
          modelling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> a general estimate of how well our
          comparative modelling prediction methods have performed
          at different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
          Even though our methods produced mediocre results at
          CASP1, we realised that a major problem with accurate
          comparative modelling had to do with the interconnected
          nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] : If a certain region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> varied with respect to the homologue, then
          it was likely that a structurally interacting region
          would also vary, even if that region was conserved in
          sequence. We therefore developed a graph-theory based
          approach to address this problem which demonstrated
          significant progress in loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The CASP3 and CASP4</TIMEX> results are minor
          improvements over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CASP2</TIMEX> results since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancements</ENAMEX> made to the graph theory method have been
          minimal.
        
        
          Performance of methods at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CASP1-3</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio
          prediction
          In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio category, as with
          comparative modelling, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments did not
          live up to the results previously published in the
          literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 19</NUMEX> ] . It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP3</TIMEX> (the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> where we took part in this category) that the first
          consistent positive results were seen: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> groups
          were able to predict the correct topologies for small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, or large fragments of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6.0</NUMEX> Ã… C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> RMSD relative to the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 25</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          CASP4
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> CASP was held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>. CASP4
          demonstrated further improvement in our methodologies in
          both comparative modelling and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Our
          approaches combine a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> procedure, simulated
          annealing, genetic algorithms, graph theory, and
          semi-exhaustive searches with move sets consisting of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> and discrete state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and scoring
          functions consisting of all atom-based pairwise
          functions, hydrophobicity indices, secondary structure
          preferences, and hydrogen bonding. The goal was to
          develop components that form a structure prediction
          engine, combining and innovating upon previously
          developed approaches by observing what methods work well
          at the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments, and adding new
          components of our own.
          We focus here on the results of our prediction
          methodologies on all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> sequences, for which an
          experimental answer was later available. Unlike the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessors</ENAMEX>' evaluations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> (which has recently
          appeared in the special issue (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S5</NUMEX>) of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Proteins: Structure, Function</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX> ), which focus on how well a particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> performs, we treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CASP</ENAMEX> as a test-bed for how well
          an individual method performs. Using the lessons learnt
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> successes and failures, we suggest a unified
          approach that mixes and matches between the best
          predictions to produce the best results. The aim of this
          work is to illustrate when our prediction methods work,
          when they fail, and what this means in the context of
          building models for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the genome of
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the present time</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          What went right; what went wrong
          
            Comparative modelling and fold recognition
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2compares</ENAMEX> all the predictions we made for
            CASP4 using comparative modelling and fold recognition
            methods. The results are qualitatively assessed as
            being one of "excellent", "good", "useful", and
            "failure". In the comparative modelling category, we
            made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> predictions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> that had sequence
            identities ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% to 10%</NUMEX> to the nearest
            related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with known structure. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, we produced models ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> Ã…
            root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the C 
            Î± atoms between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and the
            corresponding experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for all or large
            parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, with model accuracies scaling
            fairly linearly with respect to sequence identity
            (i.e., the higher the sequence identity, the better the
            prediction). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ranged in accuracy from
            "excellent" to "useful". Figure 1shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> examples of
            the comparative modelling predictions with different
            difficulties made at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP4</TIMEX>.
            The comparative modelling and fold recognition
            targets are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2are</ENAMEX> sorted by the difficulty
            index. The percentage identities for alignments between
            several comparative modelling targets and their
            corresponding templates fall in the twilight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> or
            below (alignments with percentage identities <=
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>). In fact, such targets belong more in the category
            of fold recognition since it is clear that even a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
            identity alignment can easily result in a wrong fold
            assignment. (The percentage identity is used for
            illustration purposes only-BLAST e-values follow a
            similar trend but are most robust.)
            Our comparative modelling methods produce excellent
            models when the percentage identity between the target
            and corresponding template sequence is high (usually
            within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> for > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> identity). In
            several cases where the alignment falls into the
            twilight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-30%</NUMEX> sequence identity), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> around
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> Ã… C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> are produced (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T0122/trpa,</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T0112/dhso, T0125/spl8, T0121/malk</ENAMEX>).
            In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T0092/yeco</ENAMEX>, the percentage identity
            between the target and template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
            alignment we used was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>, but we predict <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">107 residues</ENAMEX>
            to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>. However, not all cases where
            we assumed a homology relationship provided similar
            results, and the failures are indicated as "F" in Table
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
            While the graph-theory methods have been fairly
            successful at handling the interconnectedness problem
            to build non-conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> and main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
            ] , other major problems preventing the construction of
            accurate comparative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have to do with inaccurate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> and using the template structure as a static
            model upon which to build variable main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. In the
            former case, if a region of the alignment is incorrect
            but is assumed to be correct, then no amount of further
            model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> will fix this error. In the latter case,
            the loop and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> construction methods, even if
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interconnectedness</ENAMEX> is taken into account, are limited
            by the approximate nature of the template framework. In
            other words, alignment errors are irrecoverable. Even
            though <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-70%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>) we
            thought would vary with respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> homologue
            structure were predicted to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>, this is mostly in cases
            where the approximate template is well-predicted
            (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>).
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2compares</ENAMEX> all the predictions we made for CASP4
          using our 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio methods. We made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
          predictions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> that had no detectable sequence
          relationships when we began the modelling process. We
          produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">accuracies</ENAMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> Ã… C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue proteins</ENAMEX> (or
          large fragments of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>). Figure 2illustrates some
          of our more successful predictions.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP4</TIMEX>, we were consistently able to predict <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-80</NUMEX>
          residue consecutive fragments to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 Ã…</NUMEX>, and, at
          times, to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.0 Ã…</NUMEX> C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>. These results are much more
          consistent than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP3</TIMEX>, and are also of better
          quality.
          While these predictions are a significant improvement
          compared to the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> results, we still have to
          make much progress before we can produce models rivalling
          that of experiment in accuracy. Given the range of RMSDs
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> sampled (i.e.,
          "decoys") for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (average range for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> predictions was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.3</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.6</NUMEX> Ã… C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>
          - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.6</NUMEX> Ã… C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> when only the best fragments
          are considered), it is clear that devising
          representations that will allow us to explore protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">conformational</ENAMEX> space such that near-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> conformations
          are encountered is a major bottleneck. Our filter-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> function approach generally picks conformations
          from the lower end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RMSD</ENAMEX> distribution (usually
          within the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, and no worse than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> sampled), but further improvements can be
          made.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caveats</ENAMEX> regarding the use of results from CASP
          experiments
          
            Averaging over different methods and
            contexts
            The results provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> organisers and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessors</ENAMEX> show how well a particular group did, but do
            not measure performance of individual methods in
            separate contexts. This makes it harder to determine
            which methods work well and places an inherent penalty
            on trying different non-conservative approaches. For
            example, even successful loop and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> building
            methods will fail on comparative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> based on
            incorrect alignments (in our case, we tried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
            different approaches in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories combined,
            the results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of which are listed in Figures
            1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This problem has been alleviated to some
            degree by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFASP</ENAMEX> experiment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , which provides
            a strict method-by-method automatic evaluation, but it
            requires that models be prepared by the means of an
            automated server in a relatively short time-frame.
            Ranking results by methods used (based on keywords
            provided when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is submitted, which could be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardised</ENAMEX>), and considering subsets of the target
            relevant to particular methods, would help
            significantly in identifying the methods that work
            best.
          
          
            Subjective quality of evaluations
            Once a certain evaluation measure is chosen, then
            evaluating all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> submitted by that measure is
            objective. However, particular methods appear to
            perform better depending on the choice of evaluation
            criteria used (for example, C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> over a contiguous set of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, which we prefer, vs. C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> over non-contiguous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX>). This illustrates the need for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
            measure, but even with that taken into account, there
            exists an inherent subjectivity in measurement,
            especially given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assessor</ENAMEX>'s visual evaluation of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiment (one of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.L.</ENAMEX>, was an assessor at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CASP2</NUMEX>).
            The reason there is a problem is because the results
            are not entirely clear (i.e., the problem has not been
            solved). Until predictions with accuracies rivalling
            that of experiment are made, assessment of predictions
            must be done automatically using limited and stringent
            criteria, most relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> interested in
            function. Such a criteria could include, for example,
            how well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the model</TIMEX> picks out structurally similar
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the database of known structures,
            relative to the experimental result.
          
        
        
          What can be done
          
            Promising future areas
            While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments provide for an
            environment where rapid testing of ideas is possible in
            a rigourous manner, a lot of the development is ad hoc,
            guided by intuition, and not all parameter choices are
            explored thoroughly.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments also show that there is not one
            single algorithm that can "solve" the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure
            prediction problem. The most successful methods are
            those that combine and build upon the techniques
            developed by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (special issues of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Proteins: Structure, Function</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995, 1997, 1999</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). Generally
            the methods have incorporated different sampling
            techniques and a variety of scoring functions each of
            which aids prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> only to a limited
            degree when used individually, but are producing models
            useful for further biological study when combined
            together in a coherent manner.
            To provide a guidance for future work, we analysed
            some of the more promising <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> that we discovered to
            assess their viability in improving our methods and
            making better predictions, focusing on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: alignment, refinement, sampling, and selection.
            An analysis of the results generated by our methods at
            the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> (evaluated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2002</TIMEX>) will provide
            a measure of the effectiveness of these
            improvements.
          
          
            Comparative modelling and fold recognition:
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alignment</ENAMEX> and template selection using all-atom scoring
            functions
            A major reason for alignment methods failing at CASP
            has to do with using sequence information only and not
            incorporating structural information. For example,
            while modelling <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T24/ubc9</ENAMEX>, sequence alignments generated
            by several methods have an alignment error relative to
            the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alignment</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The sequence
            identity/similarity scores would have been lower with
            the new alignment since the number of identical
            residues decreases by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> in a region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. This phenomenon has been observed time and
            again at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX>, illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3by three</NUMEX>
            examples, including <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T24/ucb9.</ENAMEX> We were later able to
            readily distinguish between the correct and incorrect
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> when an all-atom scoring function was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the models constructed using both
            alignments, and justify the changes by detailed
            environment analysis. The score for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> based on
            the correct alignments were better by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> on average
            relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with the original alignment. This
            would indicate that a sequence alignment algorithm that
            incorporates structural information in a rigourous
            manner is useful and necessary to handle the alignment
            problem.
            Historically, in comparative modelling, the template
            with the highest sequence identity or similarity to the
            target sequence being modelled has been used for
            further analysis. However, a comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
            family with known <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> shows that sequence only
            measures do not correlate absolutely with the
            structural similarity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] even in cases where the
            evolutionary relationships are obvious.
            We thus devised an experiment where we constructed
            models for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with large numbers of known
            structures (specifically the globin and the
            immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>). We then conducted an
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-against-all homology modelling exercise where every
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was modelled on every other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> (resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29 and 60</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for each member
            of the globin and immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
            respectively). We compared the performance of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom scoring function to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequence only metrics.
            The results for the globin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are given in Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. On average, using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all-atom</NUMEX> function improves
            model quality by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> Ã… C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX> compared to only using
            sequence identity. The theoretical best improvement
            that could have been achieved on average is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> Ã… C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î± RMSD</ENAMEX>. Similar improvements are
            observed for the immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
            Taken together with previously published results [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 49</NUMEX> ] , these results strongly indicate that the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom scoring function is a powerful method to
            handle the alignment problem, the template selection
            problem, the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> and main
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chains</ENAMEX>, and potentially helpful in refining models when
            continuous forms of the function are used.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction: Sampling conformational
            space
            At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP4</TIMEX>, we mixed and matched different move sets
            and search methods for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling protein</ENAMEX> conformational
            space. Since we did not have the time to test the
            performance of each move set or search method, we
            assumed they would work equally well on average and
            combined them sequentially which generally resulted in
            improvements.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> the average results of different
            combinations of move sets and search methods for a set
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (PDB codes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1ctf, 1e68, 1eh2, 1nkl,</ENAMEX>
            1pgb, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1sro</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of these were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP targets</ENAMEX>). The
            results shown are for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> trajectories with
            different starting random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>. While some of the
            combinations do not necessarily enhance the simple
            approach of using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX>-residue fragments with a
            straight-forward monte carlo procedure, the combination
            of using fragments and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-state model for making
            moves, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX> search techniques for the
            sampling, shows a significant improvement, which we
            hope to demonstrate at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP5</TIMEX> by further extending the
            preliminary studies described here. Since these
            combinations were tried with equal weighting, further
            improvement may be obtained by parameterising how the
            different move sets and search techniques are applied
            depending on the trajectory landscape.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Selecting native</ENAMEX>-like
            conformations
            Even though our all-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">atom</NUMEX> function is readily able to
            distinguish native-like conformations in certain
            scenarios, it is not adequate for large sets of decoys
            where the closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX> generated is represented
            at the topological level (â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‰ˆ 6.0</NUMEX> Ã… C 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> RMSD relative to the experimental
            result). Using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all-atom</NUMEX> function alone to select
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-like conformations is not likely to suffice when
            it is also used in the actual minimisation/search
            process, since all conformations generated in such
            searches represent local minima of this function. Thus,
            our method has incorporates multiple functions and uses
            hierarchical filtering to reduce the number of
            conformations from a large sample to a tiny fraction to
            enhance the signal and eliminate false positives.
            At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CASP4</TIMEX>, we used our expertise to manually devise a
            single hierarchical filtering scheme where we
            successively eliminated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the conformations with
            each filter until we were left with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> conformation.
            In the experiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, we compare the average
            performance of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> filters to our
            final hierarchical combination when reducing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> generated for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by our search
            method (corresponding to the last entry in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) to
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> conformations. The hierarchical combination first
            reduces the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> conformations to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> by applying
            the density function, which is then reduced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> by
            applying the hydrophobic compactness function, which is
            then reduced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000, 3000, 2000</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> in the same
            order as presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5shows</ENAMEX> that particularly promising filters
            include the use of density-based scoring functions,
            hydrophobic compactness, all-atom pairwise preferences
            and match of the final conformation to the predicted
            secondary structure. Physics-based functions based on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrostatics</ENAMEX> and van der Waals interactions do not
            discriminate well on their own, and only do so when an
            explicit solvation term is added to the functions.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5also</ENAMEX> shows that even though some of the
            individual functions perform well, the combination of
            all the functions applied in a hierarchical manner
            performs the best. As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, this
            combination was developed through intuition under
            pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiment (though here the goal
            was to reduce the total number of conformations to
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>). This suggests that there exists more optimal
            (linear and non-linear) combinations of these
            functions.
          
        
        
          Computational issues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6lists</ENAMEX> the times taken for the computational
          tasks outlined in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. Times are given per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz Pentium III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processor</ENAMEX> and for a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> such
          processors when the algorithm can run in parallel. For
          CASP4, predictions were made with computing power 1/4th
          of the capability shown.
        
        
          Application of structure prediction methods to
          whole genomes
          The qualitative assessment of our methods, considered
          independently of the difficulty of the prediction, ranks
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32/40</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as useful, good, or excellent. Similar
          results are likely to be observed when these methods are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to large numbers of sequences if we assume that
          the sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> roughly reflects the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> seen in a genome. In practice,
          it is likely that we will encounter more homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a genome since experimentalists are not as
          likely to solve a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for which there clearly
          exists a homolog.
          This is a long way from our predictions at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CASP1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          ] , and our initial implementations of these
          methodologies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 24</NUMEX> ] . Yet there is much room for
          further improvement. Besides improving the existing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodologies</ENAMEX>, and developing new ones, we can also
          integrate other existing algorithms such that consensus
          predictions can be used to assign confidence levels, as
          well as having multiple choices for an outcome that can
          be tested experimentally.
          Analyses of small genomes show that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30-40%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within the genome can be modelled by
          comparative modelling and fold recognition methods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 52</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">An additional 20-30%</NUMEX> of the sequences are (or
          contain) small domains with simple secondary structures
          that are viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio structure prediction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          ] . The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are usually not amenable to
          structure prediction and sometimes even structure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">determination</ENAMEX> (a significant fraction of the latter are
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>).
          It is thus possible to construct a "genome prediction
          engine" using the computational resources available where
          we can take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences encoded by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>'s genome and attempt to predict their
          structures, and use the modelled structures to predict
          functions. The goal of this endeavour is to improve
          existing methods and develop new ones to perform various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facets of the genome</ENAMEX>/proteome modelling task in an
          automated fashion. To this end, our predictions for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">next CASP</ENAMEX> are almost entirely focused on the
          fully-automated (CAFASP) aspect via the use of a
          prediction server
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://protinfo.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compbio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">washington</ENAMEX>.edu
        
        
          Using predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to annotate
          function
          The reason for obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for proteins
          encoded by a genome is that they can be used to
          understand function and further our knowledge about the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>'s biology. Even though structure prediction
          methods need further development, it is possible to
          produce models where functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> can be tested
          in a rational manner (for example, with mutagenesis
          experiments) through detailed analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
          Additionally, structure comparisons can be used to detect
          functional relationships that cannot be detected by
          sequence information alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , and micro-environment
          analyses that parse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for particular
          three-dimensional motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] can be used to discern
          molecular function. Both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based
          approaches, used complementarily in conjunction with
          sequence-only motif-finding approaches [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58</NUMEX> ] and
          experimental data, will enable to us better assign
          function to all or large parts of a proteome.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        
          Why is protein/proteome modelling important?
          Even given the ongoing structural genomics projects,
          the continually increasing amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and protein
          sequence data from genome projects makes it infeasible
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> and x-ray crystallography techniques to rapidly
          provide information about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Thus there is an urgent
          need for reliably predicting structure from amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> in a cell do not work in isolation of one
          another. Thus to understand the function of multi-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, or whole proteomes, from a structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viewpoint</ENAMEX>, it is necessary to have a model for many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins encoded</ENAMEX> by the genome of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. The CASP
          results indicate that structure prediction methods have
          matured to a point where they can be applied on a
          genome-wide scale, and that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> can be used
          with novel but straight-forward approaches to annotate
          and understand function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55 60 61</NUMEX> ] . The resulting
          models and annotations, when combined with other
          genomic/proteomic data, including that from gene
          expression arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] , genome-wide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] , and other proteomics studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ]
          , will provide us with a dynamic picture of organismal
          structure, function, and evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Comparative modelling and fold recognition
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Template</ENAMEX> selection and alignment
            Target sequences related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> determined by experiment (X-ray
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallography</ENAMEX> or NMR) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for comparative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modelling</ENAMEX>. If the sequence relationship between the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> and target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was unambiguous (usually
            when the sequence identity is > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>), or if there
            was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with known structure in the
            family, the template <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was used to construct
            the sole initial model. If there were many possible
            template <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were constructed using all
            available templates.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIBLAST</ENAMEX> alignments and other publicly available
            servers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenTHREADER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAM-T99</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ,
            available as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFASP meta</ENAMEX>-server [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ,
            were also used to generate a variety of choices for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate alignments</ENAMEX> were used to
            construct initial models. Thus, for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> known representative
            structure, there could be many template and alignment
            choices for constructing the initial models.
          
          
            Constructing initial models
            Following the sequence alignment, an initial model
            was generated for each template structure and
            corresponding alignment by copying atomic coordinates
            for the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (excluding any insertions/loops) and
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> of identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the target
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Residues</ENAMEX> that differed in side
            chain type were constructed using a minimum
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>) technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> method
            changes a given amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to the target amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
            preserving the values of equivalent torsion angles
            between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, where available. The other
            angles were constructed for each residue type using
            internally developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> based on the most
            frequently observed Ï‡ values in a database of known
            structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Manual inspection to improve alignments
            An all-against-all structure comparison between all
            the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> was used to produce a multiple
            sequence alignment based on structural similarity for a
            given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This alignment was used in conjunction
            with sequence information and interactive graphics to
            create new sequence alignments.
          
          
            Constructing variable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> and main
            chains
            Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> conformations for residue
            positions that differ in type between the template and
            target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were generated by exploring all the
            possibilities in a rotamer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The most
            probable conformations based on the interactions of a
            given conformation with the local main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> were
            selected using an all-atom distance dependent
            conditional probability discriminatory function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
            .
            A set of possible conformations were generated for
            main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> regions (loops) considered to vary in the
            target with respect to the template structures,
            including insertions and deletions. Main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> sampling
            was performed using an exhaustive enumeration technique
            based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> discrete torsion angle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . For
            longer main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> regions (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>), fragments
            from a database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures are used to
            generate the torsion angle values. Developments in our 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio sampling protocol were
            incorporated into our loop sampling technique.
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> experiments, main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> regions and side
            chains selected for sampling were determined visually
            using interactive computer graphics. We partially
            automated this procedure by developing programs to
            identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> with implausible packing, clashes,
            and unfavorable electrostatic interactions with other
            side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and/or main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX>-atom conditional probability scoring
            function
            The all-atom scoring function is the core of many
            aspects of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> where identification of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-like conformations is required. The function
            calculates the probability of a conformation being
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-like given a set of inter-atomic distances [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
            ] . The conditional probabilities are compiled by
            counting frequencies of distances between pairs of atom
            types in a database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. All
            non-hydrogen atoms are considered, and a
            residue-specific description of the atoms is used,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, the C 
            Î± of an alanine is different from
            the C 
            Î± of a giycine. This results in a
            total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> atom types. The distances observed are
            divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> Ã… bins ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.0 Ã… to 20.0 Ã…</NUMEX>.
            Contacts between atom types in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0-3 Ã…</NUMEX> range are
            placed in a separate bin, resulting in a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
            distance bins. Distances between atoms within a single
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> are not included in the counts.
            We then compile tables of scores proportional to the
            negative log conditional probability that one is
            observing a native conformation given an interatomic
            distance for all possible pairs of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> atom types
            for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> distance ranges. Given a set of distances in
            a conformation, the probability that the conformation
            represents a "correct" fold is evaluated by summing the
            scores for all distances and the corresponding atom
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Using graph theory to generate consistent
            conformations
            We use a graph-theoretic approach to assemble the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> and main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> conformations
            together in a consistent and optimal manner: Each
            possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX> of a residue is represented using
            the notion of a node in a graph. Each node is given a
            weight based on the degree of the interaction between
            its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> atoms and the local main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> atoms.
            The weight is computed using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom scoring
            function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Edges are then drawn between pairs of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues/nodes</ENAMEX> that are consistent with each other
            (i.e., clash-free and satisfying geometrical
            constraints). The edges are also weighted according to
            the probability of the interaction between atoms in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Once the entire graph is constructed, all
            the maximal sets of completely connected nodes
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cliques</NUMEX>) are found using a clique-finding algorithm [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . The cliques with the best total weights
            represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">optimal</ENAMEX> combinations of mixing and
            matching among the various possibilities, taking the
            respective environments into account [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The
            clique-finding approach for generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> is
            fast, since it pre-calculates all the scores. In its
            present implementation, it can sample <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10</NUMEX>
            11conformations in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> period on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> MHz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>
            processor.
          
          
            Selecting the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-like
            conformations
            All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> produced are refined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calculation and Dynamics</ENAMEX> (ENCAD) package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . For a
            given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>, there could be more than one
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom model produced. For such cases, all models
            were ranked using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom pairwise scoring
            function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and the best scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are
            considered to be the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-like ones.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> initio prediction
          
            Sampling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> conformational space
            We initially start with an all-atom conformation
            where the torsion values for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> predicted to be
            in helix/sheet by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIPRED</ENAMEX> secondary structure
            prediction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] are set to idealised values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
            The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ï†/Ïˆ</ENAMEX> values are set in an extended
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. Side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> conformations are predicted by
            simply using the most frequently observed rotamer in a
            database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . New
            conformations are generated by perturbing the existing
            conformation at an arbitrary residue by one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            methods: ( 
            i ) the torsion values for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
            residues with identical sequence from a known structure
            are used to modify the current conformation, similar in
            spirit to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] ; ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX> ) one of possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> torsion
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Ï†/Ïˆ</ENAMEX>) values derived based on the most frequently
            occurring torsion values for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in a
            database of known structures. The move sets were
            combined sequentially (i.e., where a certain number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">iterations</ENAMEX> consisted of copying torsion values for
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-residue fragments and the next few iterations would
            use torsion values from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-state Ï†<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Ïˆ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>).
            The scoring function for minimisation is primarily a
            combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all-atom</NUMEX> function, a hydrophobic
            compactness function, and a bad contacts function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
            ] . The primary search technique we used was a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolis Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>) procedure where
            conformations are accepted or rejected based on the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX>'s equation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Each trajectory was
            allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> iterations, starting with a high
            temperature such that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of the moves were accepted
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 1000</TIMEX> steps and "cooled" linearly until
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1%</NUMEX> of the moves were accepted for the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
            steps.
            At particular points in the trajectory (every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
            steps), a fragment from another trajectory was copied
            at random, similar in spirit to genetic algorithms (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX>)
            strategies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . The standard Metropolis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> would then apply: i.e., if the selected
            fragment enhanced the score of the conformation
            relative to the previous conformation, it would be
            accepted. If not, its probability of acceptance would
            be determined by the difference in score between the
            current conformation and the previous conformation. The
            probability is calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boltzmann</ENAMEX>-like
            equation where Î” 
            E is the difference in scores and
            
            kT, representing the product of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX>'s constant and temperature, is set to a value
            calculated using the standard deviation of the scores
            of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> steps in a given trajectory.
          
          
            Selecting biologically relevant
            conformations
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> generated were minimised using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENCAD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and scored using a combination of scoring
            functions that hierarchically reduces the total number
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conformations</ENAMEX> produced to one final conformation.
            The scoring functions used for the final filtering
            include the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all-atom</NUMEX> function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , hydrophobic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compactness</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue-residue</ENAMEX> contact
            function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , a density-scoring function that is
            based on the distance of a conformation to all its
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in the conformation pool, contact order [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
            ] , a secondary structure based scoring function that
            evaluates the match between the predicted structure and
            the secondary structure of a final energy-minimised
            conformation, and standard physics-based electrostatics
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> terms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> testing and comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to the
          experimental result
          We initially ran our algorithms on test sets
          consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. To minimise bias of a
          particular algorithm to a fixed test set, new proteins
          were added to the test sets regularly. In all cases where
          a three-dimensional model must be compared to an
          experimental structure, we use the root mean square
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (RMSD) between corresponding atoms of the
          prediction and the experimental answer (usually
          calculated using the C 
          Î± atoms).
