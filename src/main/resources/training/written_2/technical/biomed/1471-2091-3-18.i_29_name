        Human immunodeficiency virus type-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>) is a product of the gag-pol
        polyprotein precursor, which is subsequently cleaved by the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> -encoded protease to yield the
        active form of the enzyme [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This multifunctional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is responsible for copying the single stranded viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genome</ENAMEX> into double stranded proviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> is a heterodimer consisting of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 and 51</NUMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> designated as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66 and p51</TIMEX>, respectively.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> subunit is generated via endoproteolytic cleavage
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> subunit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between Phe 440 and Tyr 441</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        The larger subunit (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p66</NUMEX>) contains both polymerase and RNase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> activities, while the smaller subunit (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p51</NUMEX>) lacks these
        functions, in context of the heterodimer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . However,
        both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p51</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monomers</ENAMEX> are functionally inactive
        when dissociated from each other [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several years</TIMEX> have
        passed since it was first suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that could
        specifically disrupt the dimerization of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> might
        prove a worthwhile antiretroviral strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , though
        such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have yet to be developed.
        Despite the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p51</NUMEX> shares an identical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequence with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal portion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>, the two
        subunits assume different global folding patterns in the
        formation of the asymmetric heterodimer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Structural
        determination through X-ray crystallography has revealed
        that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-1RT has its polymerase domain
        in an "open" conformation, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subdomains</ENAMEX> forming a
        large cleft which accommodates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the p51
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> assumes a compact folded conformation that causes
        the active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in this subunit to be buried and
        therefore, nonfunctional [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . It has been
        proposed that the open conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66</ENAMEX> is supported by
        interactions with a closed and compact p51 molecule [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits interact mainly via their
        connection subdomains. Additional contacts, between the
        thumb subdomain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p51</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase H</ENAMEX> subdomain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66</ENAMEX> are
        also substantial [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Although there have been conflicting reports regarding
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase activity of recombinant preparations of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> homodimer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] , it has become clear that p51
        mainly plays a supportive role in context of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66/</ENAMEX>p51
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimer</ENAMEX>. Assembly of chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heterodimers</ENAMEX> formed by
        mixing subunits of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FIV-1 RT</ENAMEX>, has demonstrated
        that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p51</TIMEX> subunit of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> helps to preserve the
        functional integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 RT heterodimer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite the fact that several functions have been proposed
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p51</TIMEX> subunit, the mechanism whereby p51 performs
        these functions has remained largely undefined. Some of the
        proposed functions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> include: (i) stabilizing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA primer</ENAMEX> binding for the initiation of reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) enhancement of strand
        displacement DNA synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) as a
        processivity factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Cysâ†’Ser mutation at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p51</TIMEX> subunit has
        been shown to alter the RNase H activity of the
        heterodimeric enzyme, indicating that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the
        thumb subdomain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p51</ENAMEX> plays an important role in support
        of the RNase H activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The emergence of a
        strain of HIV-1 resistant to the non-nucleoside RT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor TSAO</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tertbutyldimethyl</ENAMEX> silyspiro amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxathioledioside</ENAMEX>) displaying Gluâ†’Lys mutation at position
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">138 in the p51</TIMEX> subunit of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> has also been reported [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] , thus implicating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> to play a more direct role in
        drug binding and/or the enzymatic activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1RT</NUMEX>.
        This report was initially surprising, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu138</TIMEX> of p51
        was thought to be quite distant from the purported
        dNTP-binding pocket of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1RT</NUMEX>, as well as the NNRTI
        binding pocket. However, in light of our recent findings
        implicating this loop region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> as a critical
        structural element supporting the catalytic functions of
        p66, it seems feasible that mutation at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX> in p51
        effectively altered the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSAO</ENAMEX> through its
        influence on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> catalytic subunit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Examination of the crystal structure of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> reveals
        the presence of a small groove like region on the floor of
        the polymerase cleft of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX>,
        comprising of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids denoted</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SINNET</ENAMEX> appears to
        fit into this groove-like region and likely stabilizes the
        polymerase domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>. In an earlier communication, we
        have shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> subunit of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> is required to
        load <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> subunit on to the template primer for DNA
        synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Our recent studies indicate that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> subunit is essential for the
        catalytic function of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> subunit. Deletion of this
        loop or substitution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanine</ENAMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop of p51</NUMEX> severely impaired the
        DNA polymerase activity of the enzyme as a consequence of
        the inability of the enzyme to form stable dimers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        These findings clearly establish the absolute requirement
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop of p51</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> dimerization.
        Nonetheless, the question regarding the optimal size and
        composition requirement of this loop for efficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimerization</ENAMEX> remains unanswered. In the present article, we
        have addressed the impact of increasing the size of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop on the dimerization process. As a preamble to
        these studies, we have increased the size of this loop by
        repeating its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> in tandem. The
        rationale for duplicating the loop sequence was to increase
        the size of this loop without significantly disrupting the
        interactions seen with the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop. The
        resulting mutant derivatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 RT</ENAMEX> containing
        insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop in either or
        both the subunits were analyzed for their ability to form
        stable dimers and other biochemical characteristics. In
        this article, we present evidence that HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> mutants,
        carrying insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8 loop</ENAMEX>
        specifically in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subunit, do not form stable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimers</ENAMEX>. This inability to dimerize substantially decreases
        the enzymes affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> consequently impairing its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> H activities.

          The ability of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> RT mutants, carrying
          insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop in either one
          or both the subunits was analyzed by glycerol gradient
          sedimentation analysis. Fractions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î</NUMEX>¼L were
          collected from the bottom of the tube and aliquots of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every third fraction</TIMEX> were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS PAGE</ENAMEX>. The
          results shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, indicate that the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sedimentation</TIMEX> peak for the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66/p66 homodimer</ENAMEX>
          was between fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-19</NUMEX> of the gradient (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel A</ENAMEX>),
          whereas the wild type p51 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> sedimented between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-28</NUMEX>, as a monomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX>). The
          sedimentation pattern for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 WT/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX>
          indicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct peaks. While the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> WTsubunit
          predominantly sedimented in between fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-19</NUMEX>, at
          the predicted position of the homodimer, the p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSsubunit</ENAMEX> sedimented between fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-28</NUMEX>, indicating
          a monomeric conformation (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Panel D</ENAMEX>). This sedimentation
          profile indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/p51</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">INSmutant</ENAMEX> carrying
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid insertion</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of its p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is unable to form stable heterodimer. Under these
          conditions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> WTsubunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 WT/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX>
          tends to homodimerize. The mutants, p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INS</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel</ENAMEX>
          B) and p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INS</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel F</ENAMEX>), exhibited a distinct
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sedimentation</TIMEX> peak between fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-28</NUMEX> of the
          gradient, indicating that these enzymes are unable to
          form stable dimers. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p51 WTmutant</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel E</ENAMEX>), in which only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> subunit carried an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop sedimented between fractions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-19</NUMEX> of the gradient, indicating that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits
          can form stable heterodimers. These analyses imply that
          the proper size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subunit
          of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> is important for the formation of a stable
          dimeric enzyme.
          In order to correlate the sedimentation profile of
          these insertion mutants with their functional activity,
          we analyzed the polymerase activity in the various
          gradient fractions. These results are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1B. The polymerase activity profile of the gradient
          fractions of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66/p66</ENAMEX> and the p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>/p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WTmutant</ENAMEX> revealed major polymerase activity peaks
          corresponding to fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-19</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). This activity
          peak correlates with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> band intensity seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A(panels A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) and is also in agreement with the
          sedimentation pattern of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes.
          Interestingly, the activity profile of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/</ENAMEX>p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSmutant</ENAMEX> also yielded a peak corresponding to gradient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-19</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B), thus substantiating our
          contention that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> WTsubunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/</ENAMEX>p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">INSmutant</ENAMEX> tends to self-dimerize and form the
          catalytically active p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homodimer</ENAMEX>. The wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p51</ENAMEX> and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p66 INSand</ENAMEX> p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INS</ENAMEX>, the
          sedimentation profile of which indicated a monomeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) were conspicuously devoid of any
          polymerase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). These results imply that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subunit of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> is
          critical in forming functionally active dimeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          DNA polymerase activities of wild type HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and
          its insertion mutants
          DNA polymerase activity of the wild type HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and
          its mutant derivatives were quantitatively determined on
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heteropolymeric RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49-mer</NUMEX>)
          templates, primed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX> labeled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> primer. As
          documented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, insertion of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          segment in both the subunits (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p66 INSor</ENAMEX> p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INS</ENAMEX>), resulted in significant loss of polymerase
          activity corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> reduction.
          Interestingly, when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSmutant</ENAMEX> was dimerized with
          the wild type p51 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p51 WT</ENAMEX>), the polymerase
          activity was restored to wild type levels. The same
          result was obtained when p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSwas</ENAMEX> dimerized with p51
          having Aspâ†’Ala mutation at amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> position 186 (one
          of the catalytically crucial carboxylate triad) but
          having an intact <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop. The rationale for using p51
          D186Amutant was to ascertain that the wild type
          polymerase activity observed with p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 WTwas</ENAMEX> not
          due to residual polymerase activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX>. These results
          suggest that insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8 loop</ENAMEX>
          of p51 but not in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX> is detrimental to the function of
          the heterodimeric enzyme.
          As shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, evaluation of the polymerase
          activity of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1RT</NUMEX> and its insertion
          mutants by primer extension assay generally mirrored the
          results observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> precipitation assay,
          summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loops of both the subunits (p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">INS/p66 INSor</ENAMEX> p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INS</ENAMEX>) resulted in significant
          impairment of polymerase activity of the mutant enzymes.
          On an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA template</ENAMEX>, both these enzymes exhibited total
          lack of polymerase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B), though the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX> exhibited residual primer extension
          capability on a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), while the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSp/66 INSmutant</ENAMEX> was inactive on this template.
          Consistent with the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> precipitation
          assay, both the mutants, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p51 WTand p66 INS/</ENAMEX>p51
          D186A, exhibited near wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 WT/p51 WT</ENAMEX>)
          polymerase activity on both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX>. Thus,
          the impairment of the polymerase activity seen with these
          mutants carrying insertion in either both the subunits or
          specifically in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subunit may be related to the
          inability of these mutants to form stable dimers
          resulting in a closed polymerase cleft.
        
        
          Effect of insertion in either or both the subunits
          of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> on the DNA binding function of the
          enzyme
          Earlier we have shown that substitution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop with alanine reduced the DNA
          binding ability of the enzyme. Similar results were
          obtained when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were deleted from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop</ENAMEX>. We therefore, concluded that the effect was exerted
          via p51 since alanine substitution or deletion
          specifically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> subunit had no effect on DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and polymerase activity of the enzyme. We
          speculated that alanine substitution or deletion in the
          loop of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> subunit may shorten the interacting
          sphere of the loop which may not be able to induce
          opening of the polymerase cleft in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>, which is
          essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding. Given the fact that shortening
          of this loop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> prevented DNA binding, we were
          interested in examining the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          insertion on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding. Therefore, we determined the
          equilibrium dissociation constants (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d ) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> for the
          wild type enzyme and its mutant derivatives by gel
          mobility shift assay. For this purpose, we used a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>-mer
          heteropolymeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> template primed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Results shown in figure 3and table 2indicate
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-fold reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding affinity when both the
          subunits carried insertion (p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INS</ENAMEX>) in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8 loops.</ENAMEX> Similar results were obtained with the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INSmutant</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the DNA binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> was restored to the wild type levels, when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant p66</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> was dimerized with the wild type p51
          (p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 WT</ENAMEX>). We expected that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/</ENAMEX>p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSmutant</ENAMEX> would also exhibit reduction in its affinity
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, since insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the p51
          subunit was speculated to be detrimental for the
          dimerization process. However, the DNA binding affinity
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/p51</ENAMEX> INSmutant was similar to the wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. Our glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis had
          revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX> does not form
          stable dimers, rather the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66 WTsubunit</ENAMEX> tends to self
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimerize</ENAMEX>. Thus, the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding affinity seen
          in case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/p51</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">INSmutant</ENAMEX> may be attributed to
          the presence of these p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p66 WThomodimeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          Based on our observations from the sedimentation
          analysis, we propose that the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding
          function in case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1RT</NUMEX> insertion mutants results
          from a failure to form stable dimers. The wild type p51
          alone exhibited very low DNA binding affinity with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1300</NUMEX>-fold higher than the wild
          type heterodimeric enzyme. These results suggest that the
          optimal size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subunit of
          the HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> dimer is crucial for opening the polymerase
          cleft of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> subunit.
        
        
          Ternary complex formation by the wild type and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> enzymes
          In the crystal structures of the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of
          HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dNTP) the finger subdomain moves by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20Ã…</NUMEX>
          towards the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">subdomain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . In this finger
          closing conformation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is locked in a stable
          ternary complex poised for catalysis. An 
          in vitro assay using dideoxy
          terminated primer annealed with the template which allows
          the next correct dNTP to bind in the ternary complex
          without actual DNA synthesis has recently been reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . Using this assay system, we have evaluated the
          ability of the insertion mutants to form the ternary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> and the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trap on such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Since binding of dNTP to the enzyme is an ordered
          mechanism which occurs only after DNA binding, the extent
          of labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> remaining bound to the enzyme in the
          presence of dNTP and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trap represents the extent of
          ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> formed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          formed at enzyme concentrations which binds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the
          labeled template primer. The preformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          then incubated in the presence of next correct dNTP
          followed by addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-fold molar excess of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unlabeled TP</ENAMEX> as the DNA trap. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> binary
          complex was completely competed out by the DNA trap (data
          not shown) while a significant amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> binary
          complex converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP-</ENAMEX>dNTP ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          resistant to competition with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trap (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
          suggesting the stability of the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Table
          2lists the apparent dNTP binding affinity for the WT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> and its insertion mutants determined from data
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. It was observed that although the DNA
          binding affinity was severely affected in case of the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX>, its apparent dNTP binding affinity in
          the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> did not change with respect to the
          wild type enzyme. However, the p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INSmutant</ENAMEX> was
          unable to form a ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> may have a different conformation and
          mode of interaction in the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. It is
          apparent that the p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INSbinds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> in a
          nonproductive manner which may have a direct impact on
          dNTP binding in the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Steady state kinetic analysis of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and its
          insertion mutants
          In order to determine whether alteration in DNA
          binding without any change in the apparent dNTP binding
          affinity of the insertion mutants is consistent with
          their kinetic parameters, we analyzed the steady-state
          kinetic parameters of these mutants. The results of this
          investigation are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. On poly
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rA</ENAMEX>).(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dT</NUMEX>) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> , only the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p66 INSmutant</ENAMEX>
          showed a significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dNTP</ENAMEX>] . This observation is in
          agreement with the apparent dNTP binding affinity data in
          the ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, where p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INSmutant</ENAMEX> was
          found to be defective in forming a productive ternary
          complex. This observation is also consistent with our
          suggestion that p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p66 INSbinds</ENAMEX> nonproductively to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> that may influence the formation of ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 INS/p51</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">INSmutant</ENAMEX> carrying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> in both the subunits did not display the same
          reduction in dTTP binding affinity. However, the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51 INSmutants</ENAMEX> displayed nearly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency
          (k 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat /Km</ENAMEX>) compared to their wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, respectively, on this template primer. A
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency in case of the
          p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 WTwas</ENAMEX> noted only on poly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rA</ENAMEX>). (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dT</NUMEX>) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> and may be template-primer
          specific. None of the enzymes displayed a significant
          reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dNTP</ENAMEX>] when the heteropolymeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA\DNA template primer</ENAMEX> was used, although the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51 INSmutants</ENAMEX> exhibited drastic
          reduction in catalytic efficiency. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/</ENAMEX>p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSdisplayed</ENAMEX> no change in either dNTP binding or
          catalytic efficiency. These results are in keeping with
          our analysis of the polymerase and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding assay</ENAMEX> for
          this mutant. Once again, we believe that the wild type
          p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> in this enzyme preparation tends to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homodimerize</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p51</TIMEX> INSfails to participate in
          stable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dimer</ENAMEX> formation. This phenomenon masks the
          deleterious effect of the insertion mutation.
        
        
          RNase H activity of the insertion mutants
          Since the polymerase activity of the homo- and
          hetero-dimeric enzymes carrying insertion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX>
          loop in both the subunits (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/</ENAMEX>p51
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>) was drastically impaired, it was of interest to
          examine how this insertion affects their RNase H
          activity. To evaluate this, we employed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-DNA</ENAMEX>
          hybrid, and examined the cleavage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          strand of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> by the wild type enzyme and its
          mutant derivatives. The result of this analysis is
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Similar to their polymerase
          activities, the RNase H activities of the p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>/p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 INS/p51</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">INSmutants</ENAMEX> were severely impaired.
          This is not surprising, since our analysis of the DNA
          binding function of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> had indicated a
          substantial loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding affinity, which in turn
          is expected to affect both the polymerase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase H</ENAMEX>
          functions. Dimerization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> INSsubunit with the
          wild type p51 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p66 INS/p51 WT</ENAMEX>) carrying an intact <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX>
          loop resulted in substantial recovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase H</ENAMEX>
          activity. The RNase H activity seen in case of the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">WT/</ENAMEX>p51 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSmutant</ENAMEX> was not surprising since the p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTsubunit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66 WT/p51 INSmutant</ENAMEX> tends to
          self-dimerize and form the catalytically active p66
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homodimer</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In an earlier investigation on the role of the p51
        subunit of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>, we demonstrated that decrease in size
        of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop impairs the catalytic function of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In the present studies, we demonstrate
        that maintaining the wild type size of this loop in the p51
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is critical for dimerization of the enzyme and its
        catalytic activity. Duplication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²7-Î²8</ENAMEX> loop sequence
        selectively in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66</TIMEX> subunit did not affect the dimer
        formation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding or polymerase activity of the p66
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS/p51 WTmutant</ENAMEX>. However, insertion of the same amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p51</ENAMEX> prevented stable
        dimerization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> INSsubunit with either p66 INSor
        p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTand</ENAMEX> adversely impacted the DNA binding, polymerase
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> H activities. Earlier, we have shown that p51
        facilitates the loading of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p66</NUMEX> subunit on to the
        template primer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the impaired polymerase
        activity and template-primer binding affinity of HIV-1 RT
        mutants carrying insertion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> may be due to their
        inability to load the catalytic p66 (p66 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>) on the
        template primer. These altered biophysical/enzymatic
        properties of these insertion mutants may be attributed to
        the reduced dimer stability.
        Crystal structures of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66</ENAMEX> and p51
        assume different folding patterns and tertiary structures [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . It has been proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p66</ENAMEX> in a monomeric form
        exists in a closed conformation similar to p51 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Following dimerization with another molecule of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX> (or
        p66), it assumes an open conformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14 15</NUMEX> ] . The
        polymerase domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p51</ENAMEX> is buried within its core. This
        difference in tertiary structures between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits
        makes the dimer asymmetric. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> at the
        contact interface differ with respect to their position and
        location in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">3-D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> of amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">p66</ENAMEX> located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact interface</ENAMEX> are
        buried in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p51</TIMEX> folded conformation, whereas those of p51
        are scattered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p66 'open</TIMEX>' conformation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        Of the several domain interactions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66 and p51</TIMEX>,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p51</ENAMEX> is strategically positioned to
        interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on the floor of the palm
        subdomain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>. It has been suggested that the stability
        of the dimer is related to the buried surface area between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . In the nevirapine-bound HIV-1
        RT crystal structure, the total contact surface area
        between the subunits is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately ~</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4600 Ã… 2</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        major contact regions between the subunits which provide it
        stability are their connection subdomains and the thumb of
        p51 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> H domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>. These contacts account for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two third</TIMEX> of the total buried surface area.
        Interestingly, the marginal decrease in the total surface
        area due to deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î²7-Î²8 loop</ENAMEX>
        does not account for the dimer instability, thus suggesting
        that polar interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of
        p51 with the palm subdomain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX> may play a role in
        conferring stability to the heterodimer. The observation
        that a single point mutation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L289</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>, a residue not
        in direct contact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX>, also destabilizes the dimer [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] indicates that other factors may also contribute
        towards dimer stability.
        In order to analyze the impact of inserting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid peptide</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p51</TIMEX>, we used the
        molecular modeling approach. A search in the database of
        known protein structures employing the 'loop-search'
        algorithm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBYL</ENAMEX> yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> loops, of which only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        were sterically permissible. The loop exhibiting the best
        homology was incorporated in the modeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This loop of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (RFNAHGDVN) from the protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. lectin</ENAMEX> formed a short anti-parallel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strand Î²-sheet.
        This inserted loop lies in the vicinity of the palm
        subdomain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66</ENAMEX> and exhibits additional hydrophobic and
        polar interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the palm subdomain of
        p66, not seen in the wild type structure. These additional
        interactions are expected to enhance the stability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimer</ENAMEX>. However, sedimentation analysis indicates that the
        insertion mutants form unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dimer</ENAMEX>. This implies that
        the insertion may have altered the relative position of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subdomains</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits thereby perturbing the dimer
        stability. In summary, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²7-Î²8 loop</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p51</ENAMEX> is an
        important structural element involved in imparting
        stability to the heterodimer and in opening the polymerase
        cleft of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66</ENAMEX> for catalysis.

          encoding the insertion peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ile-Asn-Asn-Glu-Thr-Ile</ENAMEX>)

          Preparation of the heterodimeric enzyme with

          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p51</NUMEX> subunit with a hexahistidine-tag and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-tagged p66</ENAMEX> were used to generate the heterodimers
          containing insertion in either or both of the subunits.
          For each set of heterodimers, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">260 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p51</ENAMEX> was mixed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">660 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66</ENAMEX> in the buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM Tris

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . The rationale for using a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:3</ENAMEX>
          ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p51</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX> was to saturate the His-tagged p51
          with the non-tagged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p66</TIMEX>, ensuring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterodimer</ENAMEX> formation
          and eliminating excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p66</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAC</ENAMEX> purification. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixture</ENAMEX> was incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> and applied to

          with p51 bound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">IDA-sepharose</ENAMEX> column. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimeric RT</ENAMEX> was then eluted from the column with
          elution buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX> and

          of the mixture for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, equal volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Ã—</NUMEX>
          gel-loading dye containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> bromophenol blue and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          glycerol was added. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX> binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> formed were
          resolved at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> native polyacrylamide gel using
          Tris-Borate buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boric acid</ENAMEX>, pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX>). The amounts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> in the binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP</ENAMEX>)
          and in free form with respect to the varying
          concentrations of the enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhosphorImager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>) analysis
          of the gel. The fraction of the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was plotted
          against enzyme concentration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>] value was determined as the RT
          concentration at which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is bound.
        
        
          Ternary complex formation assay
          The ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dNTP) formation was
          assessed by incubating the binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of enzyme and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dideoxy</ENAMEX> terminated template primer in the presence of
          next correct dNTP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The binary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were
          formed by incubating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> nM of the wild type enzyme or
          its mutant derivatives with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> nM of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dideoxy</ENAMEX> terminated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33-mer/21-mer template-primer</NUMEX> as
          described above. The chosen concentration of enzyme was
          such that resulted in almost complete shift during E-TP
          complex formation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP-</ENAMEX>dNTP ternary complex
          formation was assessed by the addition of dNTP
          complementary to the next template base (in this case
          dGTP, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 Î¼M</ENAMEX>). Following incubation with dNTP at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> fold molar excess of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trap was added to
          the incubation mixture to assess the stability of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> and ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> formed by the enzyme. The
          complexes were resolved on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> native polyacrylamide
          followed by phosphorImaging. The extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-TP-</ENAMEX>dNTP
          ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> formed was quantified using ImageQuant
          software.
        
        
          RNase H activity assay
          We used a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5'- 32P</ENAMEX> labeled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer synthetic U5-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS RNA</ENAMEX>
          template annealed with a complementary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to
          determine the RNase H activity of the enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          The reaction mixture contained labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-DNA</ENAMEX> hybrid (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K Cerenkov</ENAMEX> cpm), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          dithiothreitol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml bovine serum albumin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM MgCl
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ng of enzyme in a final
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX>. Reactions were carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min</ENAMEX> and terminated by the addition of equal
          volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanger</ENAMEX>'s gel loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dye</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The cleavage
          products were analyzed on an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> denaturing
          polyacrylamide-urea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gel</ENAMEX> and scanned on a phosphorImager
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics Inc.</ENAMEX>).
