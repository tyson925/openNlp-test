        Postoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality after
        hepatobiliary operations, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        has traditionally been perceived as being high. Prior
        reports, however, have failed to identify a predominant
        class of complications, such that interventions could be
        undertaken that might be able to reduce the incidence of
        these complications. Prior reports have focused on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatobiliary</ENAMEX> procedures, such as hepatic resection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>], proximal bile duct resection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resection</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>], and biliary-enteric bypass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. There
        are no prior reports on the utilization and outcomes of
        critical care services required in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experience complications after hepatobiliary
        surgery at a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. This paper reviews the
        complications leading to the utilization of critical care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> after all hepatobiliary procedures performed over
        a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23-month period</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of specialized surgeons,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, anesthesiologists, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">internists</ENAMEX> who comprise the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatobiliary Disease Management Team of the Memorial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</ENAMEX>.

          Statistical analysis
          Results are expressed as the mean ± standard
          deviation, median(range), or as the number and percentage
          of the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> forcategoric variables.
          One-way analysis of variance was used for comparison
          ofall continuous variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson's χ</ENAMEX> 2analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orFisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test, when appropriate, were used for
          univariatecomparisons for all categoric variables
          analyzed. When multiple categoricvariables were
          determined to be statistically significant by
          univariateanalysis, they were then entered into a
          logistic regression model formultivariate analysis to
          determine independent predictors of outcome. Thesoftware
          program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">SPSS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS Incorporated</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was utilized for all statistical
          analyses. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P ≤0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          statistically significant.

        Discussion
        There is relatively incomplete information available
        within the literature as to the causes and outcomes of
        utilization of critical care services for patients
        undergoing hepatobiliary surgery. In the present paper, we
        have reviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</ENAMEX>
        experience during the period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2, 1994</TIMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 28, 1995</TIMEX>. Firstly, this study was initiated to
        help to determine the causes of major <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality after hepatobiliary surgery, such that we might
        alter our patient care in order to avoid similar
        complications in the future. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, this study was
        initiated to help to evaluate possible predictors of
        survival once a major complication had arisen, such that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX> could be given to clinicians caring for such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in determining the likelihood of ultimate survival
        of such events.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 23-month period</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.0%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> operated upon
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatobiliary Surgical Service</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</ENAMEX> required critical care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Information on similar critical care services
        utilized by comparable hepatobiliary services at other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> is not available in the surgical literature;
        however, this appears to be an appropriate level of care,
        because the mortality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated postoperatively
        with floor care alone was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). The fact that the mortality of hepatobiliary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, once admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCU</ENAMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) may be taken to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might have
        been kept for inappropriately long periods on floor care
        before being admitted to a critical care setting, or that
        the problems that arose were poorly treated in the critical
        care setting, or that the problems that arose were beyond
        the ability of critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> to salvage. The
        latter explanation seems to be the most probable.
        The causes for admission to a critical care setting were
        varied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> findings from the present results appear to
        be worth further discussing, however. First, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring a SCU admission suffered
        respiratory failure. It is possible that instituting an
        improved preoperative evaluation of pulmonary function, as
        well as instituting a pulmonary rehabilitation program,
        might help to reduce this excessive rate of respiratory
        failure. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the intraoperative blood loss among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring a SCU admission was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> 2000cm
        3and the intraoperative blood transfusion requirement among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring a SCU admission was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> units of packed
        red blood cells. Both of these values are well above the
        median values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">645 cm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3of</ENAMEX> intraoperative blood loss and
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of packed red blood cells for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraoperative</ENAMEX> blood transfusion recorded for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">496</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        undergoing hepatic resection at our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring a SCU admission
        underwent preoperative biliary drainage procedures, which
        is above the rate for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing hepatobiliary
        surgery. Our own institutional data have shown that
        previously drained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with tumors causing proximal or
        distal obstruction of the biliary <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> who undergo surgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resection</ENAMEX> or surgical bypass suffer increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraoperative</ENAMEX> blood loss [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], as well as increased
        postoperative infectious complications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>].
        Those organisms responsible for the postoperative
        infectious complications were the same as those organisms
        isolated from intraoperative bile cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 16, 17</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]. This suggests that the potential benefit of
        preoperative drainage of the biliary <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> before surgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resection</ENAMEX> is questionable and needs to be evaluated
        further.
        On univariate analysis, we found an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of a
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viral hepatitis</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postoperative</ENAMEX> mortality ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.044</NUMEX>) and a near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        a history of cirrhosis (with or without portal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postoperative</ENAMEX> mortality ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.053</NUMEX>). These findings confirm
        the prior reports of Bozzetti 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehnert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herfarth</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. Likewise, we found that preoperative prothrombin time
        was significantly ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>) higher in the nonsurviving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> versus the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who required
        postoperative critical care utilization, and preoperative
        albumin was nearly significantly ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.056</NUMEX>) lower in the nonsurviving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> versus the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who required
        postoperative critical care utilization. These findings
        confirm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior</TIMEX> reports of Nagino 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehnert</ENAMEX> and Herfarth
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Although these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were not independent
        predictors of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postoperative</ENAMEX> mortality on multivariate
        analysis, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> suggest the importance of
        hepatic function and hepatic reserve in pre-operative
        patient selection for hepatobiliary surgery, as has been
        previously established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Child-Turcotte-Pugh</ENAMEX> grading
        system for severity of liver disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. None of the
        thirty-two <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring postoperative SCU admission
        had ascites or were encephalopathic preoperatively.
        Therefore, preoperative prothrombin time and preoperative
        albumin, as well as a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viral hepatitis</ENAMEX> and/or a
        history of cirrhosis with or without portal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>,
        may be taken to indicate a need for heightened alertness to
        the possibility of the need for critical care services
        after significant hepatobiliary surgery.
        Once admitted to the critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, postoperative
        mortality increased with increasing duration of stay, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose SCU stays exceeded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.5 days</TIMEX> doing
        significantly worse. Beyond this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of survival
        and duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCU</ENAMEX> stay, we were unable to establish any
        distinct individual markers to help determine the
        appropriateness of continuing aggressive care of critically
        ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, if markers could be identified, then
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the time at which aggressive critical
        care becomes futile could be established. This would
        ultimately better assist the critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in
        advising the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or proxy as to when survival is
        unlikely, and all subsequent decisions about pursuing
        further aggressive interventions could be made with this in
        mind.
