        Prolonged or repeated agonist stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> frequently causes a reduction in
        the response to the agonist [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Short-term agonist
        exposure results in desensitization that is characterized
        by a rapid (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>) and reversible uncoupling of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> followed by sequestration
        and/or internalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> from the cell surface.
        Down-regulation occurs after prolonged agonist treatment
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>), resulting in a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> binding
        sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The processes involved in homologous
        desensitization have been extensively investigated for the
        beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor, which is the prototypical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptor</ENAMEX>. Initial uncoupling of the beta-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> after agonist binding is
        mediated by phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (GRK) of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the carboxyl tail of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated beta-2</ENAMEX> receptor enhances
        the binding of beta-arrestin, which not only uncouples the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from the signal transduction process but also
        serves as an adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that mediates entry into the
        internalization pathway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , as well as serving as a
        platform for additional signaling pathways [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The
        mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beta-2 adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor down-regulation
        appear to involve both an increase in the rate of
        degradation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as well as a decrease in the
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beta receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Down-regulation of the
        beta<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX> receptor is, in part, due to trafficking of the
        beta<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX> receptor to lysosomes via the clathrin-coated pit
        endosomal pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 adrenergic receptors</ENAMEX> also undergo
        agonist-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">desensitization</ENAMEX> and down-regulation.
        Desensitization occurs both in cell culture systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] and in the intact animal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In general the
        mechanisms of desensitization for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">alpha-2</ENAMEX> adrenergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> appear to be similar to those for the beta-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subtypes of the alpha-2
        adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2A; alpha-2B</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] . The human alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> subtype undergoes phosphorylation
        and short-term desensitization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] , whereas the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">human alpha-2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> is not phosphorylated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and
        does not desensitize [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The human alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> subtype,
        however, does undergo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrestin-dependent internalization</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . Many studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 18</NUMEX> ] , including those from our
        laboratory [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 19 20</NUMEX> ] , have demonstrated agonist-induced
        down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 receptors</ENAMEX>, although much less is
        known about the specific mechanisms for down-regulation as
        compared to the beta<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX> receptor. In contrast to alpha-2A
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2B</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> from several species, the
        human alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2C receptor</ENAMEX> does not appear to down-regulate in
        response to agonist treatment in transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . By contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opossum alpha-2C receptor</ENAMEX>
        in the OK cell line does down-regulate in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . The reason for this difference
        is the focus of the current studies.
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2A adrenergic receptor</ENAMEX> has an acidic
        serine-rich motif (EESSSSD) in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> intracellular loop
        that has been shown to be important in agonist-induced
        desensitization but not in agonist-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequestration/internalization.</ENAMEX> Site-directed mutagenesis
        studies indicate that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of these serines are
        phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRK</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> are needed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desensitization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The influence of this motif on
        down-regulation was not investigated, however. The opossum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> has a very similar acidic
        serine motif (EESSTSE) in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> intracellular loop
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ), whereas the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2C receptor</ENAMEX>
        has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] ). Thus, we postulated that the lack of down-regulation
        in the human alpha<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-2C</TIMEX> was related to having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> rather
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> serines in the motif, and furthermore that the
        ability of the opossum alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> to undergo down-regulation
        was dependent on having all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        in the EESSTSE motif. To test this hypothesis, we mutated
        the opossum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">serines</ENAMEX> and threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanines</ENAMEX> and valine, respectively, and tested whether the
        expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> would down-regulate. Down-regulation
        was not observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX> following
        treatment with norepinephrine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h.

          Sequence of the opossum alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> adrenergic
          receptor
          In the process of confirming the mutations, we also
          completely re-sequenced the wild-type clone and found
          several differences from the originally published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank #U04310</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ). The corrected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence</ENAMEX> differs from the original in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, which
          results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX> changes as detailed in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The sequence has been corrected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genbank</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX>
          The results of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]rauwolscine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saturation</ENAMEX> experiments
          using the wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX> from two
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transfections</ENAMEX> of both mutations are given in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.071</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.118</NUMEX> nM) were similar to those of the wild-type
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.113 nM</NUMEX>) and similar to the previously reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.056</NUMEX> nM for the wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2</ENAMEX> receptor for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]rauwolscine in NaPO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> buffer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Inhibition
          experiments with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rauwolscine</ENAMEX> indicated that the
          affinity of norepinephrine for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold higher (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d value) than for wild-type receptor
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Down-regulation
          After a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Î¼M</NUMEX> norepinephrine, the
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> down-regulated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of control
          (p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). By contrast, no down-regulation was
          observed with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSVA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of control) or
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAVA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> of control) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes</ENAMEX> from
        nearly all species that have been tested undergo
        agonist-induced down-regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly,
        we have shown that the potency of norepinephrine to produce
        down-regulation differs among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 receptor subtypes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 24</NUMEX> ] . The concentration of norepinephrine required to
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal down-regulation is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> Î¼M
        for the alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor</ENAMEX>. In contrast, norepinephrine is
        more potent at down-regulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2B</ENAMEX> and alpha-2C
        subtypes, with a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 70</NUMEX> nM required to
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal down-regulation. This difference in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> appears to be a characteristic of the receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> itself, because the cellular environment in which a
        particular subtype is expressed does not affect the potency
        of norepinephrine to produce down-regulation.
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2C receptor</ENAMEX> is somewhat unique among the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 receptors</ENAMEX> in that it does not appear to undergo
        agonist-induced down-regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The human alpha-2A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor, which does undergo down-regulation,
        has an acidic serine motif (EESSSSD) in the third
        intracellular loop. Sequentially mutating each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serines</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alanine</ENAMEX> decreased the phosphorylation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX> for each serine, and mutating
        either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two or the last two serines</TIMEX> to alanines
        prevented agonist-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">desensitization</ENAMEX>, but not
        agonist-induced sequestration/internalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The
        influence of mutations in this motif on down-regulation has
        not been investigated. The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2C receptor</ENAMEX>, by
        contrast, has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same region
        [Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ]. Thus, it is possible that the lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desensitization</ENAMEX> and perhaps also down-regulation of the
        human alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2C receptor</ENAMEX> is due to the fact that there are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the DESSAAAE motif rather
        than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2A</ENAMEX> EESSSSD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>.
        The opossum alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> has a EESSTSE
        acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine motif in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>), which could be a substrate for GRK
        based on the EESSSSD motif of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        we postulated that the lack of down-regulation in the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> is related to having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> rather than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> serines in the motif, and that mutating the threonine
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serine residues</ENAMEX> at the end of the opossum EESSTSE motif
        to valine and alanine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EESSVAE</ENAMEX> might
        prevent down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opossum alpha-2C receptor</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this prediction, treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Î</NUMEX>¼M
        norepinephrine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h failed to down-regulate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> containing the motif mutated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EESSVAE</ENAMEX>, although
        the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> with the EESSTSE motif was
        down-regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>.
        The inhibition data indicate that the affinity of
        norepinephrine for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> containing the mutations
        is slightly higher than for the wild-type. The affinity of
        norepinephrine for the mutated receptor lacking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
        hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately twice as high</NUMEX> as the
        wild-type. The elimination of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hydroxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> did not have any additional effect on the affinity
        of norepinephrine. These data eliminate the possibility
        that the lack of down-regulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX> is a consequence of the mutants having a
        lower affinity for norepinephrine than the wild-type.
        The elimination of the terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hydroxyl amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the EESSTSE motif is sufficient to prevent
        down-regulation of the opossum alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> adrenergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Similarly, mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2A receptor</ENAMEX> resulted in a loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desensitization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Because the EESSSSE motif in the
        human alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor</ENAMEX> is a known GRK substrate, and
        because eliminating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential phosphorylation sites
        prevents down-reguation, phosphorylation of the opossum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2C receptor</ENAMEX> may be important in the mechanism of
        down-regulation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. By contrast, a deletion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">twelve residues</ENAMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2A receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">293-304</ENAMEX>)
        which includes the EESSSSE motif did not appear to prevent
        agonist-induced down-regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Thus a
        phosphorylation pathway may not be involved in
        agonist-induced down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2A</ENAMEX> adrenergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to the hydroxyl amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX>, acidic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> may also be an important sequence element for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and regulation
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 to 313</TIMEX> in the opossum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2C receptor</ENAMEX>, which encompasses the EESSTSE motif, is
        a high acidic region, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>) of the
        residues being acidic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In an effort
        to determine if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hydroxyl amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> in an
        acidic environment might be a common motif for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and receptor regulation, we searched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein-Coupled Receptor Database</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> consecutive
        hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (either serine or threonine) in a linear
        sequence that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1/3</NUMEX> acidic with no basic
        residues which occurred in either the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> intracellular
        loop or the carboxyl terminal tail. As can be seen from the
        results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, this does not appear to be a common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motif for G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, not even for alpha-2
        adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Indeed, this motif is not found in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> which does undergo agonist-induced
        down-regulation, although as noted above a highly acidic
        region appears to be important and could be related to the
        additional negative charge provided by phosphorylation.
        Thus, it is likely that there are multiple mechanisms that
        are involved in down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        A motif with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hydroxyl amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> in an
        acidic environment appears to be important for
        down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The
        human alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2C receptor</ENAMEX>, which has a DESSAAAE motif with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, does not undergo
        down-regulation. Modification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EESSTSE</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EESSVAE</ENAMEX> was
        sufficient to prevent down-regulation of the opossum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Because these are potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation sites, our data further suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation may be involved in down-regulation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.

          Site-directed mutagenesis
          Mutations of the opossum alpha-2C <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pRc/CMV</ENAMEX> vector described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] was
          accomplished using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuickChangeâ„¢ Site Directed</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutagenesis Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene, LaJolla</ENAMEX>, CA). The SSTS
          sequence in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cytoplasmic loop (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 309-312</ENAMEX>; Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>) was mutated to SSVA
          using forward and reverse primers with the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (the bases introducing the mutation are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underlined</ENAMEX>), which also introduced a new restriction
          site: GAACTGGAGGAGAGTAGC 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GTGGCT GAGAACCGGCGCAGGAGGC</ENAMEX> and
          GCCTCCTGCGCCGGTTCTC 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AGCCAC GCTACTCTCCTCCAGTTC</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. To screen for the presence of the mutation,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-2 adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor insert was cut from the
          vector using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hind III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">895</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EcoR1</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>) and cut with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ddel</ENAMEX>. In a similar manner a further AAVA mutation was
          prepared from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSVA</ENAMEX> using GACATCGAACTGGAGGAG 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GCCGCA GTGGCTGAGAACCGGCGC</ENAMEX> and
          GCGCCGGTTCTCAGCCAC 
          TGCGGCC TCCTCCAGTTCGATGTC
          forward and reverse primers, respectively. The presence
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mutation was determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlwNi</ENAMEX>. To
          further confirm the sequence, the entire cDNA for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insert</ENAMEX> was sequenced for each mutation.

          Wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated receptors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pRc/CMW</ENAMEX> vector
          were transfected into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CHO-K1</ENAMEX> cells using calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> precipitation technique as described previously
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Stable transfectants were selected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼g/ml G-418</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geneticin; Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) and screened
          by intact cell binding using [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]rauwolscine as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Down-regulation assays
          The cells were plated at a density of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Ã— 10 5cells/ml</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">150-mm</ENAMEX> culture dishes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml of growth media and
          allowed to grow for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> to near confluence. The
          medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-418</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours later</TIMEX>, either <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 mM HCl</TIMEX> or just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM HCl
          (vehicle control) was added to each of the plates. Cells
          were harvested <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 h</NUMEX> after adding norepinephrine or
          vehicle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> was removed and the cells were rinsed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate-buffered saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 5</ENAMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was
          added to the plate and the cells were scraped off the
          plate using a rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>. The plate was rinsed once
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. The scraped cells were centrifuged at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> Ã— g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, the supernatant was discarded,
          and the pellet was stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C until assayed</TIMEX>. We used
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM norepinephrine in the down-regulation studies
          because we have previously shown that this concentration
          induces maximal down-regulation for the wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 24</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radioligand Binding</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellets</ENAMEX> were homogenized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissumizer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tekmar</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 sec</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the maximum speed
          and the suspension was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47,000</NUMEX> Ã— g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. This step was repeated a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> experiments, the resulting pellet (a crude
          particulate membrane fraction) was resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          volumes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM NaPO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) and re-homogenized
          for use in the radioligand binding assay. For
          down-regulation experiments the cells were re-homogenized
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM NaPO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>).
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saturation</ENAMEX> experiments, duplicate tubes were
          prepared containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">970 Î¼l</NUMEX> of tissue and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of [
          3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rauwolscine</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> concentrations, with final
          concentrations from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6</NUMEX> pM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> nM.
          Nonspecific binding was determined using a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>)-norepinephrine. For
          competition experiments, duplicate tubes were prepared
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">970 Î¼l</NUMEX> of tissue, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of norepinephrine at
          various concentrations, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]rauwolscine
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81.5</NUMEX> Ci/mmol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEN-Dupont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) at a single
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> nM, which is approximately the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d value. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> appropriately spaced
          concentrations of norepinephrine were used in each
          competition experiment. The extent of down-regulation was
          determined using a single concentration of [
          3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rauwolscine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.40 nM</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> times the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d value). We have previously shown
          that norepinephrine pretreatment does not alter the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radioligand K</ENAMEX> 
          d of the opossum alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX> adrenergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 24</NUMEX> ] , thus making it possible to estimate
          the receptor density with a single concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radioligand</ENAMEX>. Total binding was determined in triplicate
          and nonspecific binding in duplicate for each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dishes for each condition. All assays were
          incubated at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> min. Membrane
          suspensions were filtered through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whatman GF</ENAMEX>/B glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> filters with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-sample <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brandel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> harvester

          Filters and tubes were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radioactivity</ENAMEX> was
          determined by liquid scintillation photometry. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
