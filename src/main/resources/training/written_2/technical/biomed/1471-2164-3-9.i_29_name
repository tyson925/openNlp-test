        Coiled-coil domains are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> oligomerization motifs,
        which consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more alpha helices that twist
        around one another to form a supercoil [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Peptides
        with the capacity to form coiled coils are characterized by
        a heptad repeat pattern in which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> position are hydrophobic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> position are predominantly charged or polar.
        This pattern can be used by computational methods to
        predict coiled-coil domains in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general
        classes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class is comprised of short coiled-coil
        domains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or seven</NUMEX> heptad repeats, also called leucine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zippers</ENAMEX>. They are frequently found as homo- and
        hetero-dimerization domains in transcription factors (e.g.
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class is defined by long coiled-coil
        domains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, which are found in
        a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in structuring cellular
        processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoskeletal proteins</ENAMEX>,
        the intermediate-filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, represents a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-characterized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A
        subgroup of intermediate-filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are the nuclear
        lamins, which are involved in attaching chromatin to the
        nuclear envelope and have recently been implicated in
        inherited human diseases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Besides structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of the cytoskeleton, the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        interact with them also contain coiled-coil motifs. Myosin,
        the actin motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, has an extended coiled-coil domain
        necessary for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the muscle thick filaments [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinesin</ENAMEX> and dynein, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two microtubule</TIMEX> motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        also contain coiled-coil domains [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The coiled-coil motif has also been identified in a
        variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> associated with centromeres,
        centrosomes, the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matrix</ENAMEX>, and chromatin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> associated with the inner
        filaments of the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complex</ENAMEX> is an extended
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The filamentous structures
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with both the outer and inner surface of the
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complex</ENAMEX> suggest that additional unknown
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might be involved in its assembly.
        Several large coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were also found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apparatus</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them have been shown to function in
        the docking of vesicles to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cisternae</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKAPs</ENAMEX> are adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that attach <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> PKA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> to cytoskeletal elements. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKAP</ENAMEX>, AKAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">450</ENAMEX> is a large coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein attaching PKA</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrosome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite the multitude of cellular functions in which
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> participate, the general theme is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the solid-state components of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In some cases, as in the attachment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX>, this
        function appears to be crucial for the spatial regulation
        of signal transduction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, mutations in
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coiled</ENAMEX>-coil proteins lead to specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developmental</ENAMEX> or even behavioral phenotypes. The Drosophila
        mutations 
        Mushroom body defect (a gene involved
        in the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells) and 
        quick-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> (a mutation that
        causes elevated sexual behavior) lie in two
        tissue-specifically expressed coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
        unknown function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models,
        specific point mutations in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lamins</ENAMEX> are the cause
        for autosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emery-Dreifuss</ENAMEX> muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ]
        .
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, only a small number of
        long coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been identified from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        MFP1 contains an extended coiled-coil domain and is located
        at the nuclear periphery of tobacco suspension culture
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot protein NMCP1</ENAMEX> is also located
        at the nuclear rim and has been shown to migrate to the
        spindle poles in dividing carrot suspension culture cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . The cellular function of these plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
        not known.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for myosins and kinesins have been
        identified from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and their function as motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        is under investigation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . Besides these few
        examples, nothing is presently known about plant long
        coiled-coils and their potential function in anchoring and
        structuring of different cellular events.
        In the early nineties, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reported
        lamin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in different plant species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ]
        . A purification protocol adapted from animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamins</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea nuclei</ENAMEX> was used to purify four proteins
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 49 and 66</TIMEX> kD [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against mammalian intermediate
        filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against a peptide
        derived from lamin B. By immunofluorescence and immunogold
        labeling, these antigens were located mostly in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matrix</ENAMEX>, and not predominantly at the
        nuclear rim. Similar results were obtained by other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Although these early reports were
        promising, no lamin ortholog has been identified
        molecularly from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. In a recent search of all publicly
        available plant sequences, including the full 
        Arabidopsis genome, no homologs of
        lamins were found ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meier</ENAMEX>, unpublished results).
        Similarly, despite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> reports of lamin-like proteins
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , the fully sequenced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] also
        contains no lamin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. It is therefore likely that
        non-animal eukaryotes have a distinct set of nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">envelope proteins</ENAMEX> that functionally replace the lamins.
        Here, we have used a tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing long
        coiled-coil domains to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome for
        related sequences. We have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> novel
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with extended coiled-coil domains,
        which form a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family distinct from other Arabidopsis
        long coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. They are characterized by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        novel motifs, which are highly conserved in sequence and
        position, and which were not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> outside of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice homolog</ENAMEX> was identified,
        indicating conservation between dicots and monocots.

          A yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screen was performed to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> of the tomato nuclear

          additional bait plasmids, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBD-AtMAF1 and pBD-AtRanGAP1</TIMEX>.

          The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> bp pAD-LeFPP cDNA was sequenced and was shown
          to contain an uninterrupted open reading frame in frame
          with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX> activation domain. The conceptual
          translation of this sequence leads to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">582</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (aa) with a calculated molecular weight of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64.4</NUMEX> kDa and a pI of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> methionine is at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>, and does not have a plant start ATG
          consensus sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that the cDNA is
          not full length.
          A BLAST search with the pAD-LeFPP open reading frame
          indicated that it represents a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with weak
          similarity to filament-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and
          yeast (see below). Secondary structure prediction
          algorithms showed that it is organized almost entirely in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-helical</ENAMEX> domains and contains extensive stretches of
          coiled-coil domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was

          A BLAST search was performed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeFPP</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> BLAST, sequences with
          highest scores represented a number of uncharacterized
          open reading frames in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome, followed
          by sequences for animal filament-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as
          myosin, kinesin, ankyrin, etc. While the e-values for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ORFs</ENAMEX> were between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2e-56</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-16</ENAMEX>, the best
          e-value for a non-plant sequence was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.003</NUMEX> for an unknown
          human open reading frame. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> "hits"
          represented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> unique genes, some of which had
          repeated entries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          A translated BLAST search identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional
          "hit" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice BAC</ENAMEX> H0212B02 of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AL442007</NUMEX>). The "hit" lay between the
          annotated open reading frames H0212B02.17 and H0212B02.18
          in a region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> not predicted to have coding capacity.
          However, running <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenScan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] on this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>,
          an open reading frame of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1074</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> was identified
          on the opposite strand that contained the "hit". The
          predicted coding region begins at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114,922</NUMEX> of the
          H0212B02 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>, ends at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107,317</NUMEX>, and
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> predicted introns. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> open reading
          frame was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">OsFPP</ENAMEX> and was included in the sequence
          and structural analysis shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3shows a comparison of the secondary structure of
          LeFPP with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ORFs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice ORF</ENAMEX>.
          All open reading frames are characterized by extended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alpha-helical</ENAMEX> and coiled-coil domains. The extension of
          the coiled-coil domains shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3is derived from
          the "coiled-coil" analysis software in the DNASTAR
          sequence analysis software package, and was confirmed in
          all cases by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MultiCoil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MultiCoil</ENAMEX> predicted that all coiled-coil regions have a
          high probability to form dimers and a low probability to
          form trimers. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ORFs</ENAMEX> were named
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtFPP1 - AtFPP7</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). They fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> according to size and extension of coiled-coil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. AtFPP1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtFPP2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtFPP3</ENAMEX> are shorter (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">603 aa</ENAMEX>
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">779 aa</ENAMEX>) and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extended coiled-coil domains

          AtFPP7 are longer (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">866 aa to 1054 aa</NUMEX>) and contain a
          longer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and a shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal coiled-coil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, separated by a long non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">coiled</NUMEX>-coil linker domain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice ORF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OsFPP</ENAMEX>) resembles structurally
          more the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ORFs</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          shorter stretches of coiled-coil domains separated by a
          long linker.
        
        
          Novel sequence motifs define a subfamily of plant
          coiled-coil proteins
          Alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences showed the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> novel sequence motifs, which are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          conserved between the tomato and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> proteins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motifs II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> are also <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> conserved
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OsFPP</ENAMEX>, while motif I is present, but slightly less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in the monocot sequence. Their location in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Their position with
          respect to the arrangement of the coiled-coil domains is
          strikingly conserved, despite differences in spacing
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> motifs due to the different length of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the coiled-coil domains.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Motifs I and II</ENAMEX> always correlate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of coiled-coil domains, with motif I being
          located at the beginning and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">motif II</ENAMEX> at the end of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motif III</ENAMEX> is always located in the linker
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal coiled-coil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motif IV</ENAMEX> is always located at the very end of
          the most C-terminal coiled-coil domain. This positioning
          is conserved even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice sequence</ENAMEX>, where the
          C-terminal coiled-coil domain is extremely short (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identities between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> dicot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% to 50%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B), with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> sequence showing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 13% and 26%</NUMEX> identity
          with the dicot sequences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with
          the greatest similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeFPP</ENAMEX> is AtFPP1 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          identity).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> an overview of the genomic organization
          of 
          AtFPP1 through 
          AtFPP7 and of the features of the
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The genes are not clustered, and no
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them are arranged in tandem array. Except for
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
          present on each chromosome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> have been identified for
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, indicating that they are expressed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern found
          for 
          LeFPP , 
          AtFPP expression covers a variety
          of tissues and developmental stages including shoots,
          hypocotyls, roots, and siliques.
          In order to identify more long coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome, the complete list of annotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> was searched with the keyword "myosin" to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that had been annotated as myosin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Because of the long stretches of conserved heptad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repeats</ENAMEX>, BLAST searches with large coiled-coil proteins
          usually produce significant e-values with at least some
          of the large number of myosin heavy-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> sequences in
          GenBank, frequently leading to this annotation.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> identified this way were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MultiCoil</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> were found to contain coiled-coil
          domains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 200</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> showed no
          coiled-coil motifs and were discarded. AtFPP2 and AtFPP5
          had been annotated as "myosin-like" too and were
          therefore identified in this search. They were discarded
          to avoid duplication. None of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> new
          coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contained any of the conserved
          motifs identified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> new sequences were aligned with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> AtFPP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTAL</ENAMEX> analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5shows the results
          represented as a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AtFPP</ENAMEX> family
          clearly forms a family of sequences separate from the
          other coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (boxed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The three
          "short" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AtFPPs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtFPP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtFPP2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AtFPP3</NUMEX> form a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sub-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, as do the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> "long" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">AtFPPs AtFPP4, AtFPP5,</ENAMEX>
          AtFPP6, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtFPP7</TIMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the two
          most closely related 
          AtFPP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          AtFPP1 and 
          AtFPP2 are located in comparable
          positions on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> duplicated segments of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          indicating that they might be derived from a recent
          duplication event.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A novel class of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coiled-coil proteins</ENAMEX> has been
        identified that are conserved in dicots and monocots. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the FPP protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are present in the
        Arabidopsis genome. They are characterized by the presence
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters of coiled-coil domains separated by a
        linker domain of variable size. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> highly conserved
        sequence motifs were identified, which are a signature
        feature of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and which are also conserved
        in the homologs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeFPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OsFPP</ENAMEX> from tomato and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,
        respectively. The tomato homolog of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPP</ENAMEX> family binds in
        a yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assay</ENAMEX> to a nuclear envelope-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, indicating that they might function in nuclear
        envelope biology.
        Besides the presence of extended coiled-coil domains,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPP</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have no sequence similarity to the
        vertebrate lamins. They also do not show significant
        sequence similarity to other vertebrate nuclear
        envelope-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LAP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LAP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAN1</TIMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emerin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A55649</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S55255</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Q9WU40</TIMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">048410</ENAMEX>, respectively). None of these proteins
        appears to have a convincing ortholog in the Arabidopsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> (data not shown), consistent with the hypothesis
        that the composition of nuclear envelope-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">proteins</ENAMEX> differs significantly between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, a recent report about the protein
        composition of the nuclear envelope of the highly divergent
        eukaryote 
        Trypanosoma brucei has identified a
        coiled-coil nuclear envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TbNUP-1</ENAMEX>) in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> that also has no similarity with lamins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        TbNUP-1 is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a striking repeat
        structure. Its full sequence is presently not known but a
        partial open reading frame of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">268</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> has been
        constructed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The near-perfect 144 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        repeats contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two coiled</NUMEX>-coil domains each. Pairwise
        alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TbNUP-1</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtFPP1 through ATFPP7</TIMEX> showed no
        significant sequence similarities beyond the typical low
        degree of similarity generally observed between coiled-coil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TbNUP-1</ENAMEX> open reading frame
        was also used for a BLAST search of the full Arabidopsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Only comparably weak similarities with other
        "myosin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>" were found.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> conserved sequence motifs identified in the FPP
        family appear to be unique to this group of coiled-coil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and are neither shared by other coiled-coil open
        reading frames present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome nor by
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as lamins from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        Their role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or function of the FPP proteins
        is presently not known, but their high degree of
        conservation in the tomato and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> sequences imply that
        they are of relevance. Several functional small conserved
        motifs have been identified in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of long
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The nuclear lamins contain short,
        conserved sequences flanking the lamin rod domain, which
        are phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cdc2 kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> amino
        acid PACT domain, which immediately follows the coiled-coil
        domain of the related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins pericentrin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKAP450</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uncharacterized coiled-coil open reading frames from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe , confers
        centrosomal localization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . A conserved domain of ca.
        50 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> was found in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX>-associated large
        coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It has been named GRIP domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ]
        or Golgi localization domain (GLD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and is sufficient
        to specify Golgi targeting in mammalian cells. Nearly all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament proteins</ENAMEX> exhibit a highly conserved
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid motif</ENAMEX> (YRKLLEGEE) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end of their
        central alpha-helical rod domain which has been shown to be
        crucial for the formation of authentic tetrameric complexes
        and for the control of filament width [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        No sequences with similarity to the consensus sequences
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">motifs II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> were found in the databases that
        might indicate their potential function. However, a
        sequence with some similarity to motif I was identified in
        the hemaglutinin-esterase fusion glycoprotein from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> virus C (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S07412</NUMEX>).
        Alignment of this sequence (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39 to 74</TIMEX>) with the
        central conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of motif I:
        A--GWEK---<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E---LK</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L------------R</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-D</ENAMEX> (-- indicating
        non-conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>) shows a good match of identical and
        conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX>:
        A--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFEK---D---LK</ENAMEX>--I---------<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-E</ENAMEX>. The fusion
        glycoproteins contain a coiled-coil domain and are involved
        in fusing the viral envelope with the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX>.
        The conformational change of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> necessary for
        membrane fusion is driven by ionic interactions between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> of the coiled-coil domain, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu74</ENAMEX>, the last
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid aligning</ENAMEX> to motif I, is involved in this process
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In light of their putative interaction with the
        nuclear envelope-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein MAF1</ENAMEX>, it will be
        interesting to investigate if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPPs</ENAMEX> are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> systems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant cell</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        A family of novel long coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been
        identified from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. They are characterized by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        clusters of long coiled-coil domains separated by a
        non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">coiled</NUMEX>-coil linker and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> novel sequence motifs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
        filament-like plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPP</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are present in the
        Arabidopsis genome, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> homolog each has been
        identified from tomato and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>. Thus, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> appears to be conserved among higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, but
        we have not found convincing homologs from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> or animals
        by sequence similarity searches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomato FPP</ENAMEX> was originally
        isolated in a yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hybrid screen with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAF1</TIMEX>, a small
        plant-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> associated with the nuclear envelope
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Because the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome does not
        appear to contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for lamins, it is of particular
        interest to investigate which other long coiled-coil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> might functionally replace lamins in the plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> represents an exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screen
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tomato</ENAMEX> leaves ( 
          Lycopersicon esculentum ) was
          isolated as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruissem</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
          mRNA was purified using the mRNA purification kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia Biotech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). To construct the
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid library the cDNA synthesis kit, the
          Gigapack III <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> packaging extract and the HybriZAP
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">predigested</ENAMEX> vector kit (all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratagene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA) were used according to the protocol of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. The size of the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
          determined to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 × 10 6plaque</NUMEX> forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The
          complete cDNA of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LeMAF1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number
          AF118113) was cloned as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI/XhoI</ENAMEX> fragment between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SalI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of the bait vector pBD-GAL4

          including the transformation, the isolation of clones,
