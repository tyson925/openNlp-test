        The rigid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> that forms a protective layer around
        most bacterial cells is chiefly composed of peptidoglycan,
        a biopolymer unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The backbone of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidoglycan</ENAMEX> consists of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of alternating 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetylglucosamine</ENAMEX> (NAG) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetylmuramate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAM</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> linked
        by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-4</ENAMEX> glycosidic bond between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hexoses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAM</ENAMEX>
        units of the glycan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> are linked to short peptides,
        which are synthesized via a ribosome-independent mechanism,
        and contain both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">canonical L</ENAMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and unusual
        D-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-links between these peptides hold
        together the glycan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and give the cell wall its
        characteristic rigidity. While this generic structure is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bacteria</ENAMEX> there are number of
        variations, in particular lineages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, in terms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adducts</ENAMEX> to the glycan, and composition of the peptide chain
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. A large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of conserved enzymes, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosyltransferases</ENAMEX> (which form the hexose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">racemases</ENAMEX> (which generate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidyltransferases</ENAMEX> and transpeptidases (which form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-peptide linkages) are involved in the biosynthesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidoglycan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. The bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamic</ENAMEX>, and undergoes reorganization during vegetative
        growth, development and cell division [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. In
        these processes the wall is disassembled through the action
        of a diverse set of enzymes that hydrolyze various linkages
        in peptidoglycan. These enzymes include glycosidases, such
        as lysozymes, that attack the polysaccharide backbone, and
        peptidases that degrade the cross-linking peptides [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        Some of these enzymes are also encoded by bacteriophages
        and are used to degrade the host cell wall [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> and structural analysis of the
        peptide-hydrolyzing enzymes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have revealed a
        large diversity of peptidases with different catalytic
        mechanisms. Some well studied examples of these peptidases
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>-dependent peptidases of the Hedgehog
        carboxy-terminal domain fold and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>-peptidases with a
        PAS domain-like fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis autolysins LytE</ENAMEX> and
        LytF, the 
        Listeria monocytogenes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> p60
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p45</ENAMEX> and the 
        Streptococcus PcsB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> define
        another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of somewhat less well explored
        peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are present in all
        bacterial lineages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. This family
        includes the 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> membrane-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC</ENAMEX>, and possesses a catalytic domain
        containing a conserved amino-terminal cysteine and a
        carboxy-terminal histidine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (here
        termed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) from the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus</ENAMEX> have been shown to be D,
        Lendopeptidases that hydrolyze the
        D-Î³-glutamyl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">meso</NUMEX>-diaminopimelate linkage in the cell-wall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> , disruption of LytE
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cw1F</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LytF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cw1E</NUMEX>) causes the normally rod-shaped cells
        to assume a long filament-like morphology as a result of
        defective cell-wall separation during cell division [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 22</TIMEX>]. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. monocytogenes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p60</ENAMEX> is an essential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and has a similar role in cell separation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        Multiple paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/P60 catalytic</ENAMEX>
        domains are present in most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the
        N1pC<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is a peptidase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with a widespread
        role in the dynamics of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>.
        We sought to understand the evolutionary history of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in cell-wall dynamics, because such an
        analysis could throw light on the emergence and
        diversification of this uniquely bacterial structure. Such
        an investigation could also uncover hitherto
        under-appreciated components of cell-wall dynamic systems
        and could help in clarifying the biochemical mechanisms of
        certain poorly characterized but critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, there is considerable interest in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as they could be potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-wall-hydrolyzing
        enzymes from bacteriophages themselves function as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. As a part of a comprehensive analysis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in bacterial cell-wall dynamics we
        studied the diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Here we
        present evidence that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> define a large
        superfamily, which encompasses several conserved lineages
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which were previously not known to be related
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. These include the cell-wall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hydrolases</ENAMEX> typified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pal protein</ENAMEX> from streptococcal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] and the amidase domain of the bacterial
        and kinetoplastid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
        We also show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX> exist
        outside the bacterial superkingdom, in eukaryotes, large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>, positive-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> and certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX>. In eukaryotes, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this family
        has been studied experimentally, and possesses LRAT
        activity rather than peptidase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> versions, along with certain bacterial forms,
        show a circular permutation of the domain which results in
        a swapping of the positions of the catalytic cysteine and
        histidine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the sequence. These observations
        point to greater diversity in terms of biochemistry,
        biological functions and structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> than has
        previously been recognized in this superfamily.

          Sequence analysis and detection of novel divergent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>
          To determine the entire extant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/P60</ENAMEX> family
          we initiated PSI-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] searches of the
          non-redundant database (expect (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>)-value for inclusion in
          threshold = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, iterated to convergence) with a number
          of starting points, such as the catalytic domains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis LytF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C1wE</NUMEX>) and LytE
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C1wF</NUMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P60 and P45</TIMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli N1pC</ENAMEX>. A search with the
          N1pC of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 15802120, residues</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-154</NUMEX>) recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several P60</TIMEX> homologs in its first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iteration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YaeF</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> iteration, E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LytN</ENAMEX> of

          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> iteration, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Ã 10 -6</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches
          initiated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> from the newly detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          YaeF, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LytN</ENAMEX> detected their closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> in the initial iterations, but in subsequent
          iterations they recovered several classic <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/</ENAMEX>P60
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with significant E-values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E < 0.01</ENAMEX>),

          suggesting that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> defined a novel
          superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The large set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous proteins</ENAMEX> from diverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> which was recovered in these searches typically
          contain a characteristic amino-terminal conserved region
          with a cysteine, followed by a carboxy-terminal conserved
          region with a characteristic histidine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; see
          also Additional data files). In between these conserved
          regions there is another characteristic stretch with a
          highly conserved glycine that is often followed by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aspartate</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Hereinafter, we term these
          obviously related bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as the classical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/</ENAMEX>P60 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Thiol peptidases of the papain-like,
          transglutaminase-like, adenoviral protease-like, and
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hemoglobinase</NUMEX>-like folds have a conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteine</ENAMEX> (C)-histidine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) pair [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>] (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the context of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">C-H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/</ENAMEX>P60
          peptidase domains, along with the central motif with the
          conserved glycine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>), defines a unique constellation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) which is not encountered in any of
          the above peptidase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, this pattern
          served as a good marker to identify divergent homologs of
          the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1pC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The above searches
          unexpectedly recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> and its homologs from various
          eukaryotes, 
          Caenorhabditis
          elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">developmental regulator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-26</ENAMEX>, candidate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from poxviruses and
          animal positive-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> with statistically
          significant E-values. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Transitive</ENAMEX> searches initiated with
          the divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> detected in these searches
          additionally recovered the amidase domains of bacterial
          and kinetoplastid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPS</ENAMEX> and the bacterial
          peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lactococcus AcmB</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Staphylococcus LytA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] and LytN
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] and their homologs.
          The presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> tandem repeats of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1pC/</ENAMEX>P60
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">module</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein YwtD</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis</ENAMEX> allowed us to define
          the amino- and carboxy-terminal boundaries of this domain
          quite precisely. The domain begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 25-30</TIMEX>
          residues before the amino-terminal conserved cysteine,
          and ends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> from the carboxy-terminal
          conserved histidine. A search for conserved motifs using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling procedure resulted in the detection of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conserved motifs with a probability of chance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">occurrence < 10 -12in</ENAMEX> the search space comprising
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. These motifs correspond to the
          above-mentioned conserved signatures, which are
          characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and were
          readily identifiable in all true positives recovered in
          the transitive sequence profile searches. Interestingly,
          the eukaryotic versions typified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX>, their viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> and the bacterial forms typified by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli YaeF</ENAMEX>, while containing all
          the hallmark signatures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> catalytic domain,
          showed a reversal in the positions of the motifs with the
          conserved cysteine and the conserved histidine in their
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Thus, in these
          proteins the central motif of the classic NlpC/P60
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the conserved glycine was the most
          amino-terminal conserved motif, followed by the motif
          containing the conserved histidine, and then the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with
          the cysteine. This arrangement suggested that there was a
          circular permutation with respect to the classical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> module in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. All the NlpC/P60
          homologs recovered in the above searches were collated
          and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit</NUMEX>-score to
          high-scoring pairs (HSP)-length ratios using the
          BLASTCLUST program. Multiple sequence alignments were
          prepared for the individual clusters using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Coffee</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]
          and their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was predicted with the PHD
          program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. A comparison revealed that the core
          secondary structures of both the classical NlpC/P60
          modules as well as those with permuted motifs showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          or greater concordance. These observations, taken
          together, suggest that classical NlpC/P60-like
          peptidases, the LRAT-like permuted forms, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divergent GSPS</ENAMEX> amidase domain-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> comprise a
          vast superfamily of enzymes with different biochemical
          activities.
        
        
          Structural and biochemical features of the NlpC/P60
          superfamily
          Secondary-structure prediction, based on multiple
          sequence alignments, revealed that the NlpC/P60
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> adopt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an Î±</NUMEX> + Î² fold with segregated Î±
          and Î² elements (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The first recognizable
          secondary structure element in this domain is an Î±-helix
          that is present in practically all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this
          superfamily, with the exception of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AcmB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), where it appears to have entirely degenerated. The
          most prominent Î±-helix, which is conserved in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of this superfamily, is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> helix, which
          is associated with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> conserved motif. The
          conserved cysteine occurs at the extreme amino terminus
          of this helix and is typically preceded by a polar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. The central motif with the conserved glycine and
          the motif bearing the conserved histidine correspond to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> conserved strands. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> more strands are
          predicted to occur carboxy-terminal to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands.
          Of these, the strand that immediately follows the strand
          with the conserved histidine, contains a conserved polar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX> (either histidine or an acidic or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amide residue</ENAMEX>).
          By analogy with all other thiol proteases, in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> superfamily peptidases the cysteine would act as
          the nucleophile that attacks the peptide bond, while the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> acts in sequential steps as the base and then
          acid catalyst for the proton transfers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. In other
          thiol proteases the histidine is oriented to a hydrogen
          bond with the cysteine by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
          The presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> conserved polar position in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> that follows the histidine-containing strand
          suggests that it serves as the orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> for the
          catalytic histidine in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX>. While there is no
          directly detectable sequence similarity between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/</ENAMEX>P60 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other superfamilies of peptidases,
          the arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catalytic residues</ENAMEX>, with respect to
          the conserved secondary elements, in this superfamily is
          the same as that in several other peptidase superfamilies
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The configuration, comprising a catalytic
          cysteine at the amino terminus of a helix packed against
          a core <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded Î²-sheet, with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and third
          strands bearing the catalytic histidine and its orienting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, is seen in the transglutaminases and a
          related class of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> acetyltransferases,
          papain-like proteases, adenoviral proteases and ubiquitin
          carboxy-terminal hydrolases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 38</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          suggests that despite the absence of significant sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain is likely to contain a
          structural core corresponding to the classical
          papain-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protease</ENAMEX> fold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          In the case of papain-like proteases - calpains,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transglutaminases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -acetyltransferases - the</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded sheet of the core is incorporated into
          Î²-barrel with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent strands</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Contrary to this, in the case of the ubiquitin
          carboxy-terminal hydrolases and the adenoviral proteases
          there is a tendency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> to be incorporated into
          a scaffold with other Î±-helical elements forming a mixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> + Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The observation that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded
          unit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain is followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
          Î²-strands, suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are likely
          to form a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-stranded barrel similar to that seen in
          papain-like proteases (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain, the distance between the helix bearing
          the catalytic cysteine and the core barrel is similar to
          that seen in the transglutaminases and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -aminotransferases</TIMEX>, suggesting that
          it lacks the large insert that is seen in several
          papain-like proteases (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This difference may
          also explain the failure of sequence-structure threading
          algorithms, such as the combined fold prediction and
          3DPSSM [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], to recover any significant hits to the
          papain-like proteases. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain is
          structurally close to the minimal ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the
          thiol-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protease</ENAMEX> fold.
          The prediction of a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thiol-protease</ENAMEX> fold for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also explains the circular
          permutation of the conserved motifs that is observed in
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> and YaeF
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Precedent for such a permutation is offered
          by the adenoviral proteases, in which the Î²-sheet with
          the catalytic histidine precedes the Î±-helix with the
          catalytic cysteine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. In this fold, the carboxyl
          terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Î²-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (barrel or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX>) with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> typically occurs in close proximity to the
          amino-terminal region of the domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          could allow a permutation to survive without distorting
          the overall spatial arrangement of the catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. A comparison of the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and
          predicted secondary structure of the 'regular' NlpC/P60
          domain with the permuted versions suggests that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-stranded Î²-barrel is maintained intact, with the
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> including the helix with the cysteine
          being linked to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of
          the barrel (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biochemically</ENAMEX> characterized eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of this superfamily is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX>, which
          transfers an acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from the 
          sn-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> position of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylcholine</ENAMEX> (lecithin) to retinal, to form
          retinyl esters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. The general base of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> (cysteine) accepts the acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from lecithin,
          and this is followed by retinol being directed to attack
          the acyl-enzyme by the catalytic histidine followed by
          the release of the retinyl ester [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>]. The
          similarity of this reaction mechanism to that catalyzed
          by the catalytic-triad cysteine and serine proteases has
          been previously proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 44</TIMEX>]. The phylogenetic
          relationship we demonstrate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> and thiol peptidases shows that this catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triad</ENAMEX> was derived only once in evolution and re-used for
          different mechanistically similar reactions such as acyl
          transfer, transacylation or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">peptide-</NUMEX>bond hydrolysis. The
          presence of an analogous situation in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transglutaminases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 45</TIMEX>] and the related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -acyltransferases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] suggests
          that diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acetyl</ENAMEX>/acyltransferase activities have been
          repeatedly derived in course of the evolution of the
          papain-like fold. The presence of duplicated versions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          suggests that the permutation could have potentially
          occurred through a duplicate intermediate in which the
          either the amino or carboxyl terminus of each of the
          copies degenerated, leaving behind a stable permuted
          unit.
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thiol-protease</ENAMEX> fold, variable-sized inserts are
          often seen in the region between the strand containing
          the histidine and the strand bearing the orienting polar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. This feature is even observed in the NlpC/P60
          superfamily, including the insertion of an entire zinc
          ribbon domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> homologs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orienting polar residue</ENAMEX> is either an acidic or
          a polar amide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          thiol-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptidase</ENAMEX> fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 37</TIMEX>]. In the majority of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is
          histidine, which in the appropriate environment can act
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equivalently</ENAMEX> to an acidic orienting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. In the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AcmB</ENAMEX>-like divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the
          circularly permuted YaeF-like and poxviral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX> is an acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, as in most other thiol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidases</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AcmB</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> it
          is shifted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> with respect to the rest of
          the superfamily (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), suggesting a specific
          elongation of the strand bearing this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in this
          lineage.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Functional</ENAMEX>, architectural and phylogenetic

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P60</NUMEX>-like family
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P60</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> typified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P60</TIMEX> and its obvious
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> includes the most commonly occurring versions
            of the superfamily, which are seen in most bacterial
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this family
            have either a signal peptide or a transmembrane region,
            indicating an extracellular location (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). All
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">characterized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are peptidases,
            and they either hydrolyze the
            D-Î³-glutamyl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">meso</NUMEX>-diaminopimelate linkage or 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetylmuramate- L</ENAMEX>-alanine
            linkage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 25</TIMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> clearly identifiable
            orthologous lineages within this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> which have
            varying phyletic distributions in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
            Some of these, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YwtD</ENAMEX>-like orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
            are prevalent only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, while the
            NlpC-like orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is present in both
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and proteobacteria. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal</ENAMEX>
            lineage of the NIpC-like orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
            restricted to the bacteriophages and their prophage
            remnants in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. They hydrolyze the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetylmuramate- L</ENAMEX>-alanine
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linkage</ENAMEX>, and are potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bacteriolytic enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. They appear to represent a case where a host
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> has been exapted (re-used) by a virus for
            penetrating the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>.
            The presence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P60</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in most
            bacterial lineages suggests that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of
            this lineage was probably present before the divergence
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from a common ancestor. However, it
            appears to have differentiated to several distinct
            orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> only later in bacterial evolution.
            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologous groups</ENAMEX> show a patchy phyletic
            pattern: for example the orthologous group SCP1.148 is
            present in the actinomycetes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacterium</ENAMEX> 
            Clostridium acetobutylicum . It
            shows a lineage-specific expansion in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxon</ENAMEX>,
            with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 and 3</NUMEX> closely related, paralogous forms in the
            genomes of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> and 
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis ,
            respectively. Such phyletic patterns, together with the
            presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in genomes of phages
            and prophages, suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer was
            involved in the dissemination of some of these
            orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Gene loss is an alternative
            possibility that could in part explain the sporadic
            distribution of some of these orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. If
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> showed a consistent clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
            only from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with large genomes, in which gene
            loss is less pervasive, then gene loss is likely to be
            a major factor. However, this pattern in not observed
            (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), suggesting an important role for
            lateral transfer.
            In addition to the variable phyletic patterns, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P60</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> also show extensive
            lineage-specific diversification in terms of their
            domain architectures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
            catalytic peptidase domain is fused to domains such as
            SH3, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LysM</ENAMEX>, and choline-binding domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51, 52</TIMEX>]
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These domains probably aid them in
            interactions with peptides, carbohydrates and lipids
            that are associated with the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain is also fused to other catalytic
            domains such as the polysaccharide-hydrolyzing lysozyme
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, and the JAB domain that has recently been
            described to have metallopeptidase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54</TIMEX>].
            These are likely to function as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-headed enzymes that
            simultaneously attack different linkages in the murein.
            These architectures point to the potential diversity in
            the biological functions of the autolysins in bacterial
            cell-wall metabolism. They could be functional at
            different spatial locations and at different temporal
            points in the life cycle, thereby contributing to the
            diversity in the morphology of the bacterial cell and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            The AcmB/LytN-like family
            The AcmB/LytN-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the most divergent
            family of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
            monophyly of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is strongly supported in the
            phylogenetic analysis (RELL bootstrap: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>) and by
            synapomorphies, such as the position of the orienting
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polar residue</ENAMEX> (see above). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> major subfamilies within
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, typified respectively by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcmB</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus LytN</ENAMEX>, are predominantly
            restricted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and function
            as cell-wall hydrolases. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcmB</ENAMEX> subfamily shows a
            lineage-specific expansion in the genome of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around seven</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX>. Both the subfamilies exhibit considerable
            diversity of domain architectures, with most of the
            architectures mirroring those seen in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P60</NUMEX>-like
            family. Thus, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain fusions of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> peptidase domain with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX>,
            choline-binding, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LysM</ENAMEX>, lysozyme and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAM</ENAMEX> amidase domains
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and this implicates them in different
            processes in cell-wall dynamics. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> subfamily of
            the AcmB/LytN-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is typified by the
            amino-terminal amidase domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPS</ENAMEX> from
            Î³-proteobacteria and trypanosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 55, 56</TIMEX>]. GSPS
            is a bifunctional enzyme: its synthase domain carries
            out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent fusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> glutathione
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moieties</ENAMEX> to the polyamine spermidine to form the
            antioxidant metabolite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSP</ENAMEX>, while its amidase domain
            hydrolyzes the amide linkage to release glutathione and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spermidine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 55, 56</TIMEX>]. The proteomes of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanosarcina</ENAMEX> and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacterium 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acetobutylicum</ENAMEX> have a member
            each of this GSPS-like subfamily. Both these proteins
            are secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, with the version from 
            Methanosarcina , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MM2478</TIMEX>,
            additionally containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrandt</ENAMEX> factor A,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoglobulin</ENAMEX> and fibrinogen-like repeat domains
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
            The phyletic distribution suggests that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcmB/LytN</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> emerged early in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive lineage, through rapid sequence
            divergence. With the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPSs</ENAMEX>, all the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within each subfamily of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are
            secreted or membrane-associated. Even the closest
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPSs</ENAMEX>, namely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MM2478 and CAC1526</TIMEX>, are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secreted proteins</ENAMEX> that are likely to function as
            extracellular peptidases. This suggests that even the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPS</ENAMEX> subfamily probably arose within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> followed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer to the archaeon
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanosarcina</ENAMEX> and the
            Î³-proteobacteria. In the latter lineage, it was exapted
            to function as an intracellular enzyme, probably due to
            the similarity in structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSP</ENAMEX> and the ancestral
            extracellular substrate, namely the peptidoglycan
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>. MM2478 is a rare instance of an NlpC/P60
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> occurring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">archaeal</ENAMEX> lineage.
            Its domain architecture suggests that it might function
            as a protease in the maturation of the complex
            extracellular matrix of this multicellular
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeon</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YaeF/Poxvirus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G6R</ENAMEX>-like and the LRAT-like
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
            Both the LRAT-like and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YaeF/Poxvirus</ENAMEX> G6R
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are unified by the circular permutation that
            occurs at essentially the same point in both these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YaeF/Poxvirus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G6R</ENAMEX> shows a peculiar
            phyletic distribution of being present only in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the archaeon 
            Archaeoglobus, C. elegans and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poxviruses</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The synapomorphy that unifies
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the presence of an acidic orienting
            residue in the catalytic triad (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Given the
            widespread distribution of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
            with multiple distinct lineages, it is likely that this
            family arose early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> through a circular
            permutation from an ancestral, classical NlpC/P60
            domain. Subsequently, it appears to have been
            transferred from a bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to 
            Archaeoglobus , the nematode
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX>, and the common ancestor of all poxviruses. The
            high degree of conservation and maintenance of this
            protein across both entomopoxviruses and vertebrate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poxviruses</ENAMEX> suggests that it performs an important
            function in these viruses (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Along with
            the LRAT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain a second
            conserved cysteine (red letters in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
            carboxy-terminal to the catalytic cysteine. This second
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteine</ENAMEX> has been shown to be critical for a functional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> enzyme, suggesting that the poxviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may
            have a related activity (see below) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. Formation of
            acyl conjugates during the maturation of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> component of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capsid</ENAMEX> could be one
            such potential function. Alternatively, these proteins
            could function as proteases in the maturation of the
            viral particle.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is thus far found only in eukaryotes
            and animal viruses, with the sole exception of a single
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> from the proteomes of 
            Vibrio cholerae and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> and its
            obvious orthologs are found, in addition to the
            vertebrates, in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. In
            vertebrates the enzyme has an important role in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storage</ENAMEX> and mobilization of retinol (vitamin A) as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esters</ENAMEX> in peripheral tissues and for generating an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> in the synthesis of the rhodopsin
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromophore</ENAMEX> in the visual tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. The ortholog
            of the vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-29</ENAMEX> in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans has been implicated in
            the development of the vulva [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egl</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> function
            is required in the cell neighboring the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which it
            is expressed, suggesting that it may have a role in
            generating a regulatory signal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. This could raise
            the interesting possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-29</ENAMEX> synthesizing an
            ester similar to the retinyl esters that might function
            as a secreted differentiation signal during vulval
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The presence of orthologs in plants
            suggests that even <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> may process retinol or
            related compounds similar to those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vertebrates</ENAMEX> possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other distinct
            subfamilies that appear to have been derived from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LRAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is typified by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">candidate tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX>, which
            inhibits growth of tumors induced by the oncoprotein
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-Ras</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-rev107</ENAMEX> has been shown to exist in two
            cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX>, one of which is associated with the
            cell membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 60</TIMEX>]. This suggests that H-rev107
            could potentially act as an acyltransferase that might
            modify membrane components. A homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX> is
            detectable in the pathogenic bacterium 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae , and phylogenetic
            analysis suggests that it has been acquired through
            lateral transfer from a vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Further
            experimental analysis of this bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could
            be of considerable interest, as it could potentially
            have a role in interactions with its vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> vertebrate-specific subfamily is typified by
            the uncharacterized human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein NSE2</ENAMEX>, which could
            potentially function in a similar capacity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX>.
            However, in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> the catalytic cysteine is
            replaced by a serine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Such substitutions
            have previously been observed in other papain-like
            peptidases with the serine participating in a
            functional active site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61, 62</TIMEX>]. Multiple paralogs of
            both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NSE2</ENAMEX> are seen in vertebrates,
            suggesting some functional diversification of these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>.
            The viral homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX> were observed in
            picornaviruses such as human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parechoviruses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aichi</ENAMEX>
            virus and avian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encephalomyelitis</ENAMEX> virus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>]. We also
            detected related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caliciviruses</ENAMEX> such
            as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norwalk</ENAMEX> virus and related viruses (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> could potentially function as a
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> protease in the processing of viral
            polyproteins, or they could function as a viral enzyme
            that could modify some membrane component, like their
            cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
            including the forms from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>, clearly form a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinct</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> which excludes the YaeF/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">poxvirus</ENAMEX> G6R
            family, which shows a similar circular permutation. The
            widespread distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> suggests that they possessed the enzymes
            from an early stage in their evolution. The NlpC/P60
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> is largely absent from most archaeal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteomes</ENAMEX>. However, it is very widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
            and includes forms with circular permutations, similar
            to the eukaryotic LRAT-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Hence, the LRAT
            family was probably acquired by the eukaryotes, by the
            lateral transfer of a bacterial precursor similar to
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YaeF/YiiX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This could have either occurred
            during the primary Î³-proteobacterial endosymbiosis,
            which gave rise to the mitochondrion, or as a result of
            a subsequent transfer from some other bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
            The currently available sequences do not allow us to
            distinguish between these possibilities. The drastic
            change in biochemical function might have resulted in
            an accelerated evolution of these eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
            resulting in considerable divergence from the bacterial
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YaeF/YiiX</ENAMEX>-like forms.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We present a detailed evolutionary and structural
        analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> superfamily of peptidases. We show
        that this superfamily, in addition to the well
        characterized P60-related peptidoglycan peptidases,
        includes divergent cell-wall hydrolases typified by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcmB/LytN</ENAMEX>, eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-26</ENAMEX> and
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, amidase domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSPSs</ENAMEX>, and several
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized bacterial proteins</ENAMEX>. We identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved in catalysis, namely a cysteine, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> and a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, that are conserved
        throughout this superfamily. A comparison of the predicted
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for this superfamily with known
        peptidase folds revealed that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> show
        exactly the same arrangement as the catalytic triad of
        papain-like thiol peptidases. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> domain is
        predicted to adopt a papain-like fold, in which the
        catalytic cysteine is at the amino terminus of a helix,
        which is packed against a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five-stranded Î²-barrel</NUMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> and the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> superfamily
        has diversified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them
        - namely the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YaeF/Poxvirus</ENAMEX> G6R <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> - showing
        a circular permutation of the catalytic domain.
        This analysis could considerably aid further
        experimental investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NlpC/P60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX>.
        Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal</ENAMEX> have
        recently been proposed as potent antibacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>]. Identification of novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily in
        diverse bacterial proteomes could point to additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with similar bacteriolytic activity.
        Furthermore, this analysis could help in identifying
        enzymes with important roles in bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> and cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egl-26</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-rev107</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NSE2</ENAMEX> as
        homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRAT</ENAMEX> suggests a potential role for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as novel components of lipid metabolism in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. Further studies on the homologs of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in diverse animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viruses</ENAMEX> and the pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacterium</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae could help in uncovering
        hitherto unknown mechanisms by which these pathogens could
        interact with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The non-redundant (nr) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI)) was
        searched using the BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Profile searches
        were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with either a
        single sequence or an alignment used as the query, with a
        profile inclusion expectation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>,
        and was iterated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 64</TIMEX>]. Before use in
        PSI-BLAST searches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NlpC</ENAMEX> domain was evaluated for
        compositional bias using the SEG program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>]. No such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> that could skew the statistics of sequence
        relationships in searches of the nr database was detected.
        Accordingly, to achieve maximum sensitivity all searches
        were run with the compositional-bias-based statistics
        turned off [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>]. Multiple sequence alignments were
        constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], followed by
        manual correction based on the PSI-BLAST results. Conserved
        motifs were searched for using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling
        procedure. Homologs recovered in the searches were collated
        and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit</NUMEX>-score to
        HSP-length ratios using the BLASTCLUST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>].
        Structural manipulations were carried out using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss-PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>] and the ribbon diagrams were
        constructed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLSCRIPT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>]. Searches of the PDB
        database with query <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> was conducted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALI</ENAMEX>
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>]. Protein secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
        predicted using a multiple sequence alignment as the input
        for the PHD program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 72</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> peptides were
        predicted using the SIGNALP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73, 74, 75</TIMEX>] and the
        transmembrane regions were predicted using the TOPRED
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76, 77</TIMEX>].
        Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the
        maximum-likelihood, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining and least-squares
        methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. Briefly, this process involved the
        construction of a least-squares <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX>
        program or a neighbor-joining <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEIGHBOR</ENAMEX>
        program (both from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phylip</ENAMEX> package) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], followed by
        local rearrangement using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml</ENAMEX> program of the Molphy
        package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>] to arrive at the maximum-likelihood (ML)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The statistical significance of various nodes of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ML tree</ENAMEX> was assessed using the relative estimate of
        logarithmic likelihood bootstrap (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml RELL-BP</ENAMEX>) with
        10,000 replicates.
