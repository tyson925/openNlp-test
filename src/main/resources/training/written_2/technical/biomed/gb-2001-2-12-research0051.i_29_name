        The availability of a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>,
        including complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets encoded in diverse genomes,
        and the rapidly growing database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have
        already greatly impacted on our understanding of the
        evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure and function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. This
        process has been aided by the development of powerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> and sensitive computational tools for detecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structural similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In
        particular, methods that extract information from multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> to construct various types of sequence profiles
        and use the resulting sequence profiles for iterative
        database searching, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidden-Markov</ENAMEX>-Model (HMM)-based approaches, have
        substantially improved the detection of subtle similarities
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that previously were amenable only to
        direct structural comparison [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The sensitivity and
        accuracy of these methods have been extensively tested and
        statistical approaches for validating the observed
        similarities are available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>].
        Despite these achievements, detection and interpretation
        of relationships between homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have
        limited sequence similarity remains a major challenge. Such
        studies typically require a case-by-case approach that is
        guided by a detailed understanding of protein
        sequence-structure patterns and is rooted in the biology of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> analyzed. Prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and
        function(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized proteins</ENAMEX> is one of the
        principal outcomes of these analyses, and experimental
        verification of such predictions tends to increase
        confidence in the validity of sequence-structure
        comparative approaches. The negative feedback from
        experiments that failed to confirm a computational
        prediction is potentially even more important, because it
        could result in revision and refinement of the
        computational methods.
        When examining cases of reported prediction followed by
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">validation</ENAMEX>, however, we encountered several
        paradoxical situations. In each of these, a prediction that
        has been reportedly confirmed by experiment was
        incompatible with results obtained with several standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX> procedures. More importantly, alternative
        predictions, supported by statistically significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and/or structural similarity, were made in some of
        these cases. Here we present several such mysteries,
        describe the refutation of the original predictions and the
        new predictions, wherever feasible, and discuss the
        discrepancy between the computational and experimental
        results. The choice of the cases was not systematic;
        rather, those chosen were notable because they relied on
        novel computational techniques, exploited particularly
        subtle sequence or structural motifs, and dealt with
        crucial biological problems.
      
      
        Results
        
          MJ1477: a predicted archaeal cysteinyl-tRNA
          synthetase
          Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) specific for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are universally present in cellular
          life forms. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exceptions are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlnRS, AsnRS</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GInRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsnRS</ENAMEX> are missing in many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX> because glutamine and asparagine are incorporated
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> through transamidation of glutamate and
          aspartate, respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX> is missing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> archaeal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methanogens</ENAMEX> whose genomes have been sequenced - 
          Methanobacterium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermoautotrophicum</ENAMEX> and 
          Methanococcus jannaschii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. No
          alternative mechanism for cysteine incorporation into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is known; hence the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX> in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two</TIMEX> solutions to this puzzle, both unusual, have
          recently been proposed and experimentally validated. One
          involves non-orthologous gene displacement, a situation
          in which the same essential function is carried out by
          distantly related or even unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in different
          organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. It has been shown that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschii ProRS</ENAMEX>, a class II
          synthetase that is unrelated to the class <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I CysRS</ENAMEX>,
          substituted for the missing CysRS activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>].
          The other solution involved a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for the role
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MJ1477 protein</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> jannaschii. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (direct evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> related by
          vertical descent from a common ancestor) from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacteria</ENAMEX> 
          Thermotoga maritima and 
          Deinococcus radiodurans were
          identified as 'distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologs</ENAMEX>' of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis CysRS</ENAMEX> by using a
          computational method specifically designed to detect
          distantly related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orthologs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The method is based on
          application of discriminant analysis to alignment scores,
          in order to separate the scores for pairs of functionally
          identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from different genomes from the scores
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with different functions. This prediction
          was then validated experimentally by showing that MJ1477
          had CysRS activity 
          in vitro and that an ortholog of
          MJ1477 from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DR0705</TIMEX>,
          complemented a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX> deficient, temperature-sensitive,
          lethal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> mutant strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. An
          important corollary of these surprising findings is a
          rapid divergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ1477</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CysRS</ENAMEX>, such
          that all the catalytic and otherwise functionally
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> characteristic of this enzyme, and
          also present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I aaRSs, have changed.
          Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ1477</ENAMEX> and its orthologs do not have the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">accessory domains</ENAMEX> found in all known <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CysRS</ENAMEX>, namely the
          DALR domain (named after a distinct amino-acid
          signature), which is shared by aaRSs of several
          specificities, and another domain specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>].
          We examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MJ1477</ENAMEX> and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> using more traditional computational techniques.
          Almost all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain amino-terminal signal
          pep-tides readily identifiable by using the SignalP
          program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], but do not contain any predicted
          transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>, and, accordingly, are predicted
          to be secreted from the cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Furthermore,
          iterative database searches using the PSI-BLAST program [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>] showed statistically significant sequence similarity
          between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and an experimentally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterized endo α</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>-polygalactosaminidase from 
          Pseudomonas <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. For
          example, in a search initiated with the sequence of
          MJ1477 and a profile inclusion cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, the
          polygalactosaminidase sequence was retrieved from the
          database in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> iteration, followed by other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterial proteins</ENAMEX> predicted to possess the same
          activity. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family has several conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, including a characteristic Dxhp signature (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>,
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>), in which the
          conserved aspartate is likely to directly participate in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The hybrid<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-fold</NUMEX>-recognition method,
          which combines sequence-profile analysis with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">alignment</ENAMEX>-based secondary-structure prediction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX>-PSSM method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] both suggested a likely
          α-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">amylase</NUMEX>-like triosephosphate isomerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIM</ENAMEX>) barrel
          structure for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Thus, although the
          identification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ1477</TIMEX> as a secreted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polygalactosaminidase</ENAMEX> or a related polysaccharide
          hydrolase with a different specificity awaits
          experimental verification, it shows all the signs of a
          correct computational prediction: statistically
          significant similarity between the analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
          an experimentally characterized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">enzyme</TIMEX>; conservation of
          distinct motifs implicated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">catalysis</TIMEX>; potential
          presence of a structural fold compatible with the
          experimentally demonstrated enzymatic activity; and
          confident prediction of the extracellular localization
          that is, again, compatible with a polysaccharide
          hydrolase activity involved in environmental carbohydrate
          utilization or capsular metabolism. None of this evidence
          is offered by the analysis that led to the CysRS
          prediction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ1477</TIMEX>.
          Therefore we are forced to conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ1477</ENAMEX> and
          its homologs are not related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX> and there is
          nothing in the computational analysis of these proteins
          that would point to an aaRS activity. In contrast, we
          predict these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to be extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polygalactosaminidases</ENAMEX> or similar polysaccharide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolases</ENAMEX>. The polysaccharide hydrolase and aaRS
          functions seem to be essentially incompatible. First, a
          secreted enzyme is unlikely to function as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aaRS</ENAMEX> whose
          site of action is, by definition, intracellular. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
          even if an entirely new class of aaRSs is postulated, the
          reaction catalyzed by this new aaRS does not resemble
          polysaccharide hydrolysis or its reversal. Aminoacyl-tRNA
          synthetases catalyze a succession of reactions, which
          involve: hydrolysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">α-β phosphate</ENAMEX> bond in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>;
          condensation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> with the cognate amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
          resulting in the formation of an aminoacyl-adenylate;
          displacement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> moiety of the aminoacyl-adenylate
          with the cognate tRNA, producing aminoacyl-tRNA. Even if
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> condensation reactions, in very general terms,
          could be considered a reversal of the polysaccharide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> reaction, there is no indication that
          polysaccharide hydrolases could bind and hydrolyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>,
          and the multiple alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ1477</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> did not
          include any conserved signatures typical of potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>-binding loops (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Neither does this
          family contain any recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains.
          Finally, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. thermoautotrophicum</ENAMEX> does not
          encode any homologs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ1477</TIMEX>, ruling out the possibility
          that this family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encompasses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CysRS</ENAMEX> of both archaeal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methanogens</ENAMEX>. Taken together, these observations appear to
          effectively refute the prediction of a CysRS activity,
          thus pitting computational results against experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          MJ0301: a predicted dihydropteroate synthase
          Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) catalyzes the
          condensation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -aminobenzoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin</NUMEX> pyrophosphate to give
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>-dihydropteroate, an intermediate in folate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staphylococcus</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, has been crystallized and shown to adopt a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIM</ENAMEX>-barrel structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Although it has been
          indicated that no DHPS could be detected in archaeal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], orthologs of bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DHPS</ENAMEX> are readily
          identifiable in all archaea; this enzyme is missing only
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and in several intracellular bacterial
          pathogens, such as 
          Rickettsia prowazekii, spirochetes
          and mycoplasmas (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COG0294</NUMEX> in the database of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clusters of</ENAMEX>
          Orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (COGs)) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Most
          archaea have a distinct version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX> that shows
          relatively low sequence similarity to the bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> and contains an additional uncharacterized
          carboxy-terminal domain. This previously undetected
          domain is also present in some other enzymes of pterin
          biosynthesis, such as
          tetrahydromethanopterin-S-methyltransferase from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.M.I.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LA.</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.V.K.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation). Some archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
          including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
          Halobacterium, have the
          bacterial-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHPS</ENAMEX>, which was probably acquired by
          horizontal gene transfer and displaced the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeal</ENAMEX> version. Despite the relatively low sequence
          similarity to bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DHPS</ENAMEX>, all archaeal orthologs have
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved catalytic residues</ENAMEX> identified in DHPS
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and are confidently predicted, by the
          hybrid-fold-recognition method, to assume the same fold
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX> from 
          Pneumocystis carinii and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> whose crystal
          structures have been determined.
          An analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>, a program developed to
          recognize folds by comparing predicted secondary
          structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]; we are unaware of a
          published detailed description of this method),
          identified MJ0301 as a homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX>, although, given
          the low sequence similarity, a convergent origin of the
          relationship between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ0301</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX> was deemed likely
          (there seems to be a terminological confusion involved
          here, but we are quoting the results of the original
          computational analysis of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as they have been
          presented). It was acknowledged that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ0107</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          COG0294) could be identified as a possible homolog of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX> by sequence-based methods, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          assayed for dihydropteroate synthase activity, but none
          was detected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In contrast, DHPS activity (albeit
          relatively low) was shown 
          in vitro for the partially purified
          MJ0301 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ0301</ENAMEX> has been shown to
          belong to the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily of enzymes
          and, in the evolutionary classification of
          metallo-β-lactamases, belongs to an archaea-specific
          family (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COG1237</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Metallo-β-lactamases
          encompass a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-dependent hydrolytic</ENAMEX> and
          oxidoreductase activities with a variety of substrates
          and are particularly abundant in archaea where some of
          them are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. None of these
          enzymes catalyzes a reaction resembling the condensation
          reaction catalyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX>. The characteristic motifs of
          metallo-β-lactamases, which mostly include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>-binding
          histidines, are highly conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ0301</TIMEX> and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In contrast, most of the MJ0301
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> described as equivalent to the functionally
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of

          synthase are not conserved, even among the archaeal
          orthologs of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Finally, the β-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lactamase</ENAMEX> fold
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subdomains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">β4-α-β-α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topology</ENAMEX> whose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">β</ENAMEX> sheets are sandwiched against each other; in structural
          terms, these domains are completely different from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIM-barrel</ENAMEX>, with which the ORF program matched the MJ0301
          structural prediction. Taken together, these observations
          are sufficient to reject the proposed relationship
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between MJ0301</TIMEX> and dihydropteroate synthases.
        
        
          MJ0757: a predicted thymidylate synthase
          Thymidylate synthase is a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> of pyrimidine
          metabolism that catalyzes the formation of deoxythymidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophosphate</ENAMEX> (dTMP) from deoxyuridine monophosphate
          (dUMP) by transfer of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to its pyrimidine
          ring. This reaction is catalyzed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
          unrelated enzymes. The canonical thymidylate synthase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX>), such as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli ThyA</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">distinct α/β</ENAMEX>-fold that transfers a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to dUMP
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,10</NUMEX>-methylenetetrahydrofolate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. This classic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> is readily identifiable in many (but not all)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, eukaryotes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          Archaeoglobus fulgidus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          jannaschii, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. thermoautotrophicum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COG0207</NUMEX>).
          The archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> family share with their
          bacterial orthologs all the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">catalysis</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          An alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TS</ENAMEX> or its subunit is predicted to be
          encoded by a gene from 
          Dictyostelium that rescues a slime
          mold mutant auxotrophic for thymidylate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is not homologous to the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX>, but its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea show an almost perfect
          complementary phyletic distribution (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COG1351</NUMEX>).
          In a screen for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschii</ENAMEX>, the ORF method
          picked the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MJ0757 protein</ENAMEX> as the most likely homolog of
          the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. In the validation
          experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ0757</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpressed</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> was shown to possess TS
          activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Sequence searches show that MJ0757
          belongs to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of euryarchaea-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of uncharacterized function (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COG1810</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX> reported to be conserved between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MJ0757</TIMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> were conserved thoughout the MJ0757
          family (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Moreover, a comparison of the
          secondary structure elements derived from the reported
          three-dimensional model of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ0757</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and those derived
          from a prediction generated using a multiple alignment
          query with the structure-prediction program PHD (such
          predictions typically exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> accuracy), showed an
          overlap of just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 or so</NUMEX> secondary structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Conversely, several sequence motifs
          that are characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MJ0757</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> did not
          overlap with the conserved regions in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MJ0757</NUMEX>-TS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Furthermore, some, but not all,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MJ0757</NUMEX> family contain an amino-terminal
          insertion of a small, metal-chelating module (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>),
          which was used to improve the alignment with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli TS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], although this
          region was variable even within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the MJ0757</TIMEX> family itself.
          On the basis of these observations, a relationship
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between MJ0757</TIMEX> and the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> has to be rejected.
          The actual fold and function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MJ0757</ENAMEX> and its homologs
          cannot be predicted at present. However, these proteins
          have several features that suggest that they might be
          metal-dependent enzymes potentially involved in redox
          reactions. These suggestive features include the fusion
          with a ferredoxin domain seen in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> thermoautotrophicum member
          MTH601, the insertion of the metal-binding module in
          certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, including MJ0757 (see above), and the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cysteines that are conserved throughout
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cmpp16: a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plant 'paralog' of</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> viral movement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          Viral movement <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (MPs) are encoded by diverse,
          unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of plant viruses, such as
          positive-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, negative-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, single-stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>, and are essential
          for cell-to-cell movement of all these viruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>].
          To isolate potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> homologs of the red clover
          necrotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mosaic</ENAMEX> virus (RCNMV) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were used to screen phloem extracts of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cucurbita maxima</ENAMEX>, resulting in the
          detection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cmpp16</TIMEX>. This protein
          was identified as a 'paralog' (generally, this term
          refers to homologous genes related by duplication within
          the same genome) of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MPs</ENAMEX> on the basis of
          sequence similarity detected using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megalign</ENAMEX> program [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>]. Subsequently, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cmpp16</TIMEX> was shown to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, which is
          a common property of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MPs</ENAMEX>, and to induce an increase
          of the size-exclusion limit of plasmodesmata, also a
          mechanism associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          However, computational analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cmpp16</NUMEX> sequence
          reveals a picture that is incompatible with a homologous
          relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPs</ENAMEX>. Cmpp16 consists mostly of a C2
          domain that is readily detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST or by
          profile-searching engines such as the CD-search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cmpp16</NUMEX> sequence contains all critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the
          C2 domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). C2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> bind a variety of
          substrates, such as Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, phospholipids, inositol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but apparently not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. There is no detectable similarity between C2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPs</ENAMEX>, and conserved motifs in the
          published alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cmpp16</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCNMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> do not
          correspond to those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C2</TIMEX> domains; moreover, many of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> described as conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cmpp16</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> within the viral movement protein family
          itself. Thus, we conclude that viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cmpp16</ENAMEX>, a
          C2-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, are not homologs. Subsequently, a
          similar methodology has been employed to detect a
          relationship between Cmpp36 (a cytochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reductase</ENAMEX>),
          Cmpp16 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCNMV</ENAMEX> movement <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. As in the
          above case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cmpp16</TIMEX>, this relationship of a cytochrome
          B5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reductase</ENAMEX> with the viral movement proteins appears to
          be spurious (data not shown).
        
        
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activating transcription factor-2</ENAMEX> (ATF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>): a
          predicted histone acetyltransferase
          Histone acetyltransferases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAT</ENAMEX>) are key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of
          eukaryotic transcription. GCN5-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HATs</ENAMEX>, which modulate
          chromatin-associated transcription, belong to a vast
          superfamily of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> acetyl- and
          myristoyl-transferases with extremely diverse functions [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> is a basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leucine zipper</ENAMEX> (b-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZIP</ENAMEX>) family
          transcription factor that binds to cyclic AMP-response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (CRE) and activates transcription [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATF-2</ENAMEX> also has an amino-terminal zinc finger,
          which is involved in transcription activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
          Non-vertebrate orthologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX>, in 
          Drosophila, Caenorhabditis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elegans</ENAMEX> and yeasts, lack the zinc finger. In
          experiments designed to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATF-2-associated HAT</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> alone was shown to be sufficient for the
          acetyltransferase activity. Examining the region of ATF-2
          that showed HAT activity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found some sequence
          similarity and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> motif resembling the
          acetyltransferase superfamily and concluded that ATF-2
          contained a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN5</NUMEX>-like acetyltransferase domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
          Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis supported the
          importance of the reported acetyltransferase motifs for
          the HAT activity of ATF-2.
          However, profile-based sequence searches and attempts
          at fold recognition failed to detect any relationship
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-2</ENAMEX> and the acetyltransferase superfamily. The
          region designated as having HAT activity and containing
          the acetyltransferase domain shows poor conservation
          between orthologs and closely related paralogs of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATF-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, especially in the sequence identified as
          the most prominent A motif of the acetyltransferase
          family (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Furthermore, complexity analysis using
          the SEG program, with the parameters adjusted for
          decomposition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> into globular and non-globular
          regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], predicted that the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2 protein</ENAMEX> between the amino-terminal zinc finger and
          the carboxy-terminal helical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b-ZIP</ENAMEX> was unstructured. This
          is consistent with the structural prediction derived
          using the PHD program that indicated no regular secondary
          structure in this region. Thus, the relationship between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN5</NUMEX>-like acetyltransferase superfamily
          seems to be invalid, leaving the structural basis for the
          reported acetyltransferase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> an open
          issue.
        
        
          Predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domain in the phytochrome-interacting
          transcription factor PIF3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domains are sensory modules in various signal
          transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from all major lineages of cellular
          life [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domains are typically implicated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sensing oxygen</ENAMEX>, redox potential, light and small ligands
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domains are sites for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> and are responsible for the
          formation of homo- and hetero-dimers in several signal
          transduction pathways that involve transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domain has been reported in the
          transcription factor PIF3 from 
          Arabidopsis, which interacts with a
          phytochrome photoreceptor and transduces light signals to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoresponsive</ENAMEX> plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. It has been
          hypothesized that the purported PAS domain of PIF3
          directly interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domains of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytochrome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. This hypothesis was later tested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX> and evidence was presented that the PAS
          domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIF3</ENAMEX> indeed was a major contributor to the
          interaction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
          PIF3 belongs to a plant-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of basic
          helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-domain- containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that,
          in addition to the bHLH domain, have an uncharacterized
          conserved domain at the amino terminus present in single
          or duplicate copies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.M.I.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.Z.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.V.K.</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished observations). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PIF3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> currently
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralogous proteins</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and an ortholog from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX>. The region predicted to be a PAS domain is poorly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> ortholog of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIF3</ENAMEX> and the paralogs
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. An alignment with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX> ortholog indicated that the proposed PAS domain was
          a rapidly diverging, compositionally biased sequence
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Complexity analysis using the SEG program
          showed that the reported PAS domain mapped to a region
          that was predicted to be entirely non-globular. All
          attempts to objectively detect a PAS domain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIF3</TIMEX> using
          sensitive profile methods based on PSI-BLAST-derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> matrices or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidden Markov Models</ENAMEX> (HMM) failed.
          Additionally, secondary-structure prediction for the
          proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> region using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> indicated that this region
          is largely unstructured. These observations appear to be
          sufficient to reject the presence of a PAS domain in PIF3
          although the region thought to be a PAS domain could
          indeed be involved in the interaction with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytochrome</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion and conclusions
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cases described above, we provide evidence
        for rejecting the homologous relationships and functional
        predictions inferred for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in question by using
        computational methods. The number of examples in this
        category could be increased, and some have already been
        considered in the literature, for example the spurious
        discovery of a 'functional PDZ domain' in the molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chaperone ClpA</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>], see refutation in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]) or the
        finding of an ATPase domain and death effector domains in
        the apoptosis-associated protein FLASH ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">refutation</ENAMEX> in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]). The common and most striking aspect
        of all these cases is that the predictions based on
        apparently erroneous computational analysis were supported
        by experiments. What are the solutions to this clash
        between computational and experimental evidence?
        We envisage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main possibilities. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
        experiment-centered view would hold that experimental
        evidence always has the upper hand and that, even if the
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">computational solutions</ENAMEX> that we describe here
        seem more plausible than the original predictions, the
        latter are correct insofar as they are supported by
        experiment. Epistemologically, this argument is not sound
        because hypotheses (computational predictions in this case)
        cannot be proved by the success of the experiments they
        prompt. They can only be falsified by experiments producing
        results incompatible with the predictions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Simply
        put, the experiments could have worked for a wrong reason.
        For example, this seems particularly likely in the case of
        the site-directed mutagenesis of the transcription factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> discussed above. The mutagenized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> probably
        are indeed important for the function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but
        not because they are part of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN5</NUMEX>-like acetyltransferase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, which this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does not contain. Similar logic
        applies to the case of the predicted, but apparently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonexistent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> domain in the transcription factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIF3</TIMEX>.
        More important, however, computational predictions are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">falsifiable</ENAMEX> within the realm of computational analysis
        itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falsification</ENAMEX> is offered by alternative,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unequivocally</ENAMEX> supported predictions that are incompatible
        with the original ones. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cases described
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>), such evidence was obtained by
        computational methods.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that, although the
        computational predictions described here are correct,
        whereas the original ones are wrong, the experimental
        evidence is also solid. In each of the described cases,
        this would elevate the biochemical activities identified
        through these experiments to the status of major,
        unexpected discoveries, because the chemistry underlying
        them would have to be extremely unusual. In particular, if
        the identification of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> jannaschii cysteinyl-tRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthetase</ENAMEX> is indeed correct, this enzyme would have to be
        a derivative of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of polysaccharide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrolases</ENAMEX> containing a signal peptide but no recognizable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> explanation is that the original computational
        predictions triggered over-interpretation of the
        experimental results that, in reality, might have been
        obtained as a result of nonspecific activities,
        contamination or other artifacts. In this regard, it is
        important to realize that not only computational
        predictions, but biological experiments also, are
        intrinsically error-prone and open to conflicting
        interpretations. The probabilistic nature of computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> is well realized (and at times, perhaps,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overrated</ENAMEX>) by most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, probably because explicit
        calculation of probability or likelihood is at the core of
        most widely used computer methods for sequence and
        structure analyses. In this regard, it is prudent to note
        that the alternative computational predictions presented
        here should be considered to be 'more likely' than the
        original ones, rather than to contradict the latter in an
        absolute sense. As we attempted to show above, however, the
        difference in the likelihood of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutually incompatible
        predictions can be overwhelming, with one supported by
        multiple lines of evidence as opposed to the other. In
        contrast to computational studies, experimental ones are
        often, consciously or unconsciously, treated as
        demonstration of 'final truth'. In reality, however,
        probabilistic inference is inherent in practically any
        interpretation of experimental results when questions are
        asked such as "How likely is it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> under
        study has a particular biochemical activity 
        in vivo ?" or "How central is this
        activity for the 
        in vivo function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> under
        study, given the results of a surrogate 
        in vitro assay?" Thus, certain
        experimental designs may not be appropriate to ascertain
        the actual 
        in vivo biochemistry of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, even if the particular activities detected
        under these conditions are genuine, the likelihood of these
        being relevant 
        in vivo needs to be additionally
        assessed. Accordingly, when strong computational
        predictions seem not to be borne out by experiment, the
        conditions and design of the experiments deserve special
        scrutiny: they might have given a negative result for a
        wrong reason. A case in point is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MJ0107 protein</ENAMEX>, the
        apparent archaeal ortholog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPS</ENAMEX>, which failed to show
        dihydropteroate synthase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. We strongly
        believe that this issue needs to be revisited. All this
        considered, the results of independent application of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX> and experimental techniques tend to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complementary</ENAMEX>, and useful in adding or reducing confidence
        in the biological conclusions of a particular study.
        Finally, it should be emphasized that these cautionary
        notes on application of computational methods in protein
        function prediction in no way suggest that new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">computational</ENAMEX> approaches that depart sharply from more
        established ones are doomed to failure. Indeed, the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX> advanced search methods based on sequence profiles
        - PSI-BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hidden Markov Model</ENAMEX> (HMM) search - are
        rather recent innovations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 51, 52</TIMEX>]. Furthermore,
        methods based on a different principle, such as protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">sequence-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> threading, have a recent history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> despite uncertainties in their statistical
        foundations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 53, 54, 55, 56</TIMEX>]. It does seem, however,
        that when a structurally and functionally plausible
        prediction is produced, with a high confidence, by a well
        tested, statistically sound computational method, an
        incompatible prediction yielded by a new method without a
        clear statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> is most likely to be
        incorrect.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-sequence database at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI) was
        searched using the gapped version of the BLAST program [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>]. Sequence-profile searches were carried out using the
        PSI-BLAST program, with the cut-off for inclusion of
        sequences into the profile set at 
        E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 9</ENAMEX>], and the HMMer
        program package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. Multiple alignments of amino-acid
        sequences were generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>].
        Protein secondary-structure predictions were generated
        using the PHD program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 60</TIMEX>], with multiple alignments
        of individual protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> used as queries.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sequence-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure threading</ENAMEX> was carried out using the
        combined<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-fold</NUMEX>-prediction algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX>-PSSM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> based on the use of a three-dimensional
        position-specific scoring matrix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> peptides in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> were predicted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SignalP</ENAMEX> program
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. The COG database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62, 63</TIMEX>] was used as a source of
        information on orthologous relationships between
