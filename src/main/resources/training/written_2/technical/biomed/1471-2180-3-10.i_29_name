        Mycobacteria are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-fast, pleomorphic,
        non-motile rods belonging to the order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinomycetales</ENAMEX>. 
        Mycobacterium avium complex organisms
        consist of the human and animal pathogens 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium subsp. 
        avium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> avium subsp. 
        paratuberculosis , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium subsp. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silvaticum</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> studies have long ago established a genetic
        similarity between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium subspecies 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avium</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium subspecies 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Now
        that whole genome sequencing technologies are available,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> can begin to examine genetic relatedness in
        greater detail through direct nucleotide-nucleotide
        comparisons. These comparisons are particularly important
        in instances where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genetically similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have
        little or no specific diagnostic tests to distinguish
        each.
        The literature reports genetic similarity between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 72% and 95%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX>
        ] depending on the region analyzed. However, despite the
        reported similarities, these mycobacteria are quite
        different phenotypically. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> is an
        intracellular pathogen that infects ruminant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, most
        notably cattle and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>. The site of infection is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> tract, where it causes a chronic
        inflammatory ailment termed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Johne's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In
        contrast, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> is common in the
        environment, causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and disseminated
        infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Growth of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> is characterized
        by its slow rate (doubling time of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22-26 hours</TIMEX>, compared to
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-12 hours</TIMEX> for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> ) and requirement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobactin</ENAMEX> in culture media [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . With the absence of a
        well-defined genetic system for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> , a comparative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> approach holds great potential in addressing the
        genetic basis for many of these phenotypic differences.
        The genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that
        range from fast-growingsaprophytes such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> fortuitum to slow-growing
        pathogens such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. leprae</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis . Although the
        chromosomal origin of replication has been studied in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , the genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the
        origin of replication in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> has been
        previously unknown. Knowledge of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
        sequence of this region is particularly important because
        chromosomal replication may be regulated by a common
        mechanism that could directly affect rate of growth.
        Several features of the 
        oriC region are highly conserved
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The sequence immediately flanking the 
        dnaA gene is considered the origin of
        chromosomal replication, or 
        oriC <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . This region
        contains several genes that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> required for
        basic cellular functions, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> subunit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase P</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RnpA</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein L34</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RpmH</ENAMEX>), the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication initiator protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX>), the beta subunit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA polymerase III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaN</ENAMEX>), the recombination repair protein
        RecF, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA gyrase proteins GyrA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GyrB</ENAMEX>. The
        relative gene order in this region is also highly conserved
        in many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gram-positives</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Although intergenic sequences in this region are conserved
        only among closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">DnaA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> is found
        in the non-coding regions flanking 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dnaA</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> studied [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> boxes are conserved nucleotide sequences (TTGTCCACA)
        where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, triggering events that
        ultimately lead to replication initiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        In an effort to understand the genetic basis for growth
        rate and other phenotypic differences between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> , we have analyzed the
        genetic similarity of these genomes using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strategies.
        First, the putative 
        oriC region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> was amplified,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> and compared with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        we examined nucleotide identity outside the 
        oriC region using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> homology matrix
        analysis as well as using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis sequences from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> compared with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium sequences present in the
        unfinished microbial genomes database. Our results show
        that these subspecies not only have a conserved gene order
        surrounding the origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chromosomal replication</ENAMEX>, but also
        have a high synteny and nucleotide identity throughout both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. In addition, this preliminary comparative survey
        of the genomes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis show even greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>) than the literature suggests (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72% to 95%</NUMEX>)

          An <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~11-kb</NUMEX> contiguous genomic fragment from

          Alignment of the region surrounding

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis oriC region
          conforms to the conserved gene order that is present in
          other mycobacteria as well as the closely related

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, relative to the rest of the genome sequence,
          consistent with findings in other <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-positive bacteria
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38% - 40%</NUMEX> A/T, vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">~33%</NUMEX> in the entire sequence).
        
        
          A vast majority of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosisK-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          genomic sequence have considerable nucleotide similarity
          to sequences from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogenic</ENAMEX> isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          avium104
          As a basis for all nucleotide comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis in this study,
          an alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16s</NUMEX> rRNA gene was performed. That
          analysis revealed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> nucleotide identity over the
          entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,472</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bp gene</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Likewise, the 
          oriC <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> was found to
          share a high level of nucleotide identity (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>) with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium . Calculation of the rates
          of total nucleotide diversity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) and synonymous
          substitution per synonymous site (ds) and non-synonymous
          substitution per non-synonymous site (dn) revealed
          patterns of variation within the range observed from
          sequence data outside the 
          oriC region. These calculations
          showed a high degree of similarity between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and a predominance of synonymous over
          non-synonymous substitutions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The patterns of
          nucleotide substitution varied considerably between genes
          in this region of the genome. For instance, there was
          complete nucleotide identity in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rpmH</ENAMEX> and 
          recF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 94%</NUMEX> identity in
          the gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rnpA</ENAMEX> . To verify that these
          observed differences were real and not as a result of
          sequencing errors in the yet unfinished 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium genome, we confirmed the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> by resequencing the entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> kb region from an
          isolate clone of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and obtained identical
          results (not shown).
          We next determined if the nucleotide identities would
          remain consistently high when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis sequences
          outside the 
          oriC <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were compared with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium . Sequencing of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-10 cattle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolate</ENAMEX> is nearing completion in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TIGR http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigr</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orgis</ENAMEX> in the finishing stages of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avium</ENAMEX> isolate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>. Beginning
          with nucleotide number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the 
          dnaA coding region of each genome,
          a comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX>
          bases from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium by Pustell DNA matrix</ENAMEX>
          analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , indicates that genomic similarity
          continues outside the surrounding 
          oriC <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). When
          evaluating similarities between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences of this
          size, a matrix comparison is the method of first choice.
          In addition, the matrix method displays matching regions
          in the context of the sequence as a whole, making it easy
          to determine if the regions are repeated or inverted. For
          example, figure 4shows a large <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.6</NUMEX> kb genomic inversion
          of the region surrounding nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350,000</NUMEX>. The DNA
          identity matrix also identified sequences that were
          present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genome, but absent in the other as shown
          by the broken diagonal lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These data show
          remarkable similarity over large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in both
          mycobacterial genomes.
          Finally, we analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">548</NUMEX> recombinant clones from a
          randomly sheared 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis small insert
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> in order to obtain specific rates of nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX>. Sequences from these clones represented
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> of unique (non-overlapping) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
          comprised <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">estimated 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> genome sequence. From
          this analysis, we estimated the rates of total synonymous
          and non-synonymous substitutions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> fragments that
          were aligned in-frame and then analyzed with the program
          NAGV2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] using the methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gojobori</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          . The results of these analyses show that the average
          nucleotide diversity between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.59%</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.06%</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0% to 18.8%</NUMEX>; median, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.85% ± 0.05%</NUMEX>). The
          results also show that the average rates of synonymous
          substitution per synonymous site are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.38% ± 1.32%</NUMEX>
          (range, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0% to 19.5%</NUMEX>; median, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5% ± 1.5%</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          the rates of non-synonymous substitution per
          non-synonymous site were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.89% ± 0.05%</NUMEX> (range, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9%</NUMEX>; median <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3% ± 0.05%</NUMEX>). These results not only
          indicate that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subspecies</ENAMEX> have a high degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>), but also suggest that the
          patterns of substitution have favored synonymous
          substitutions as can be expected from positive
          selection.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        With the genome sequencing projects of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avium</ENAMEX> nearing completion, we have
        been able to compare large amounts of sequence data for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. Our results show substantial nucleotide
        identity above even that reported previously in the
        literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Paradoxically, the overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity between these phenotypically distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> appears similar to that observed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenotypically</ENAMEX> identical 
        Helicobacter pylori isolates at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≥98%</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        The high nucleotide identity shared between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium directly conflicts with
        their divergent phenotypic characteristics. Because of
        strong similarity in the 
        oriC region, alternative hypotheses
        should be tested to explain the growth rate differences
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis . Genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> and the presence of unique genes identified
        by matrix analysis in this study are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such possibilities
        that could account for some of the phenotypic differences.
        We have recently reported on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis coding sequences
        that are absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . From an analysis of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis genome, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 27</NUMEX>
        predicted coding sequences were found to be absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium . Therefore, an estimated
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis coding sequences
        might be absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium following a whole genome
        analysis. This extremely low number of unique 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is in stark
        contrast to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MG1655</NUMEX> isolate
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> not found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the EDL933</TIMEX> isolate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Further analysis of this limited number of unique coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> will be critical in developing specific
        diagnostic reagents. Finally, a detailed analysis of coding
        sequences unique to each respective mycobacterial genome
        and their genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> will be necessary to
        understand the molecular basis for growth rate and other
        phenotypic differences.
        Other potential explanations include the presence of
        global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, insertion sequences,
        transcription-translation rates, genomic rearrangements and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA operons</ENAMEX>. Each respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> possesses
        insertion elements (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IS900, IS1311</ENAMEX>) at unique loci that
        could distinctly affect growth difference or other
        phenotype by insertional mutation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley-Thomas</ENAMEX> et al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        ] compared the expression of the luciferase gene in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis with the
        fast-growing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis and concluded that the
        rates of transcription and translation may not account for
        the slow growth of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis .
        We present evidence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> large-scale genomic
        rearrangement between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two subspecies</TIMEX>. This
        rearrangement consists of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.6</NUMEX> kb inversion that contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> predicted coding sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bannantine</ENAMEX> and
        Kapur, unpublished). Genomic rearrangements such as that
        described could have a profound effect on phenotype. The
        presence of multiple copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA operons</ENAMEX> within
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> can be directly attributed to faster growth rate.
        The increased gene dosage results in more ribosomes and
        therefore increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> translational capacity.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> rRNA operon is present in each subspecies
        and this is also true for the fast growers 
        Mycobacterium abscessus and 
        Mycobacterium chelonae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . These
        fast growing mycobacteria have multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that
        increase the transcriptional rate of the rRNA operon to
        overcome gene dosage limitations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The rRNA operon
        promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have not been mapped by primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> for either 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> , but if 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> had multiple functional rRNA
        operon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, that may account for the growth rate
        differences.
        The genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the origin of replication
        has been characterized in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive pathogens
        including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. coelicolor</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. leprae</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The results of
        our investigation on the 
        oriC region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis show that each of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 primer</NUMEX> pairs, designed from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium sequence data, resulted in
        the successful amplification and subsequent sequencing of
        an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~11 kb</NUMEX> region of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis genome. The
        sequenced region encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, several of
        which show a high level of identity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are
        known or predicted to be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>.
        However, we found a cluster of substitutions in a region of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rnpA</ENAMEX> (data not shown). It is
        noteworthy that in this region of the gene, each of the
        nucleotide substitutions results in an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        replacement. While mutations in this region of the gene are
        known to result in dramatic differences in ability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to respond to environmental stresses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , the
        functional significance of these differences between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis are at present
        unknown. While these sequencing efforts have revealed a
        conserved gene order in the 
        oriC of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        , the nucleotide and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium in this region is much
        stronger when compared to other mycobacteria and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). It is well recognized
        that the characterization of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the 
        oriC <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> as well as the complete
        genome sequence will provide a springboard for addressing
        questions such as the nature of the slow growth rate of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis as compared to
        the genetically related rapidly-growing mycobacteria.
        Progress on these research fronts will improve our chances
        of understanding and controlling infections caused by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX>.
        The conservation of functional sequence motifs in the 
        oriC of other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive organisms
        has provided clues to the mechanism of bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> monomers bind to specific,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-palindromic 9-</ENAMEX>nucleotide sequences called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DnaA</ENAMEX> boxes,
        and this interaction is thought to initiate replication.
        The 
        oriC of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacteria
        typically contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 - 30</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> boxes, often found
        in non-coding regions flanking the 
        dnaA gene. The interaction of DnaA
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> boxes promotes the local unwinding of a nearby
        AT-rich region, providing an entry site for the DnaB/DnaC
        helicase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The 
        dnaA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> itself is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        domains that differ in the extent of sequence homology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain IV</ENAMEX> is responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DnaA</ENAMEX> box recognition and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain III</ENAMEX> is a highly conserved region containing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 35</NUMEX> ] . Domain I participates in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperative DnaA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-DNA</ENAMEX> interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        The genetic relatedness of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis with other
        mycobacterial subspecies has been the root cause of the
        lack of development of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis -specific
        diagnostic tests. By comparing the genome sequences of both
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> , specific diagnostic tests
        may be developed and a better understanding of the
        molecular differences that contribute to unique phenotypes
        will be obtained. Finally, knowledge of the complete genome
        sequence of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. paratuberculosis</ENAMEX> is expected to
        facilitate the identification of diagnostic sequences in
        this economically significant veterinary pathogen.
      
      
        Conclusion
        With the genomes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium nearly completed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> will be able to analyze the similarities and
        differences between these genomes with amazing detail.
        Through a comparative genomic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2 million</NUMEX>
        nucleotides, we have shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subspecies, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avium</ENAMEX> and 
        paratuberculosis , are highly similar
        at the gene and nucleotide level. This is in stark contrast
        to the phenotypic differences that each displays.

          Strains and growth media
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> isolate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-10</ENAMEX>) of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] has been
          chosen for genome sequencing studies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> was
          grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Middlebrook</ENAMEX> 7H9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth supplemented</ENAMEX> with OADC

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobactin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied Monitor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fayette</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) as described
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bannantine et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium strain 104 was grown in
          Middlebrook <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">7H9 broth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using the Qiagen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QIAamp Tissue Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatsworth</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Primer design and amplifications
          A web-interfaced program, Primer3

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis fragment
          surrounding the putative origin of replication ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oriC</ENAMEX> ). By this strategy, a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 primer</NUMEX> pairs were constructed for the amplification
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> minimally overlapping fragments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~800</NUMEX> bp in
          length for this region of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis genome.
          Amplification reactions included the high fidelity DNA

          Library construction
          A random <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-kb insert library of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-10</ENAMEX> has been
          constructed as follows. Total 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> paratuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
          isolated and randomly sheared using a nebulizer and
          compressed nitrogen according to protocols developed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Roe</ENAMEX>'s laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ou</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. The
          resulting DNA fragments were separated by gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and fragments in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> kb
          were purified. After polishing the ends of the fragments
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), they
          were cloned into 
          SmaI -restricted/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pUC18</ENAMEX> vector.
          The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> recombinant and
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> independent recombinant
          clones.
