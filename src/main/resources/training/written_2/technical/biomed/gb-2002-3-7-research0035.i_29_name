        The cytokine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interleukin-2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) has been used
        extensively as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for immune modulation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> in cancer therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Clinical regression of
        metastatic melanoma and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal cell cancer</ENAMEX> resulted in
        long-term cures, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> has been approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> for standard therapy. Systemic IL-2
        administration also appears to dramatically increase the
        frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor regression</ENAMEX> in specific immunization
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. It has been postulated on clinical
        grounds that the anti-cancer effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> are mediated
        through 
        in vivo expansion and activation of
        cytotoxic lymphocytes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and/or promotion of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> within target tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], but it has become
        apparent that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> at the doses used therapeutically has
        broader immune/pro-inflammatory effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. In
        addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> may have a role in activation-induced T-cell
        death, therefore causing peripheral tolerance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. IL-2
        administration is also associated with potent systemic
        toxicity that limits its therapeutic usefulness [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and a
        relationship between toxicity and clinical effectiveness
        has been observed, suggesting a common effector pathway [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>]. Most peculiarly, the extent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombocytopenia</ENAMEX> and lymphopenia is associated with
        increased frequency of clinical responses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Reversal
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced toxicity by corticosteroid or anti-tumor
        necrosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> also blunts its
        therapeutic efficacy, further indicating the mandatory
        nature of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. The ability to
        distinguish the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> in target tissues from its
        systemic effects may yield important insights for the
        development of improved anti-cancer therapies.
        With the advent of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], it has
        become possible to study complex biological behaviors in
        concert in order to obtain a panoramic view of downstream
        events resulting from pathophysiological alterations of
        entire biosystems. Thus, various aspects of the immune
        response can be analyzed 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. To our knowledge,
        however, little information is available about the effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> in controlled 
        in vitro conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and none
        about the effects of 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. We have
        therefore characterized the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> administration 
        in vivo on the transcriptional
        program of circulating cells as markers of its systemic
        effect, and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor microenvironment</ENAMEX> as a marker of
        its effect on target tissue.
        We compared the time course of gene induction after 
        in vitro exposure of peripheral blood
        mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (PBMC) to IL-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/ml</ENAMEX>) with 
        in vivo exposure to a dose regimen
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU</ENAMEX>/kg every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>), which is associated with
        fairly high systemic toxicity and clinical effectiveness [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. The changes in expression profile induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> in
        the tumor microenvironment were monitored by repeated
        fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. Amplified antisense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (aRNA) obtained from 
        in vitro or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ex vivo samples</ENAMEX> was fluorescence
        labeled and hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,500</NUMEX>-spot cDNA arrays as
        previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        Test samples consisted of gradient-separated PBMC
        exposed either 
        in vitro or 
        in vivo to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>, labeled with Cy5
        (red) and co-hybridized with reference samples labeled with
        Cy3 (green). Reference samples for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> consisted of
        corresponding material for each experiment obtained before
        IL-2 exposure. For 
        in vitro experiments, for example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference samples</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> cultured in the absence of
        IL-2. For 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ex vivo</ENAMEX> experiments, references
        consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> obtained from the respective patient
        before IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. For test FNA samples obtained
        during the course of IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, reference
        material consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNA</ENAMEX> from the respective lesion
        obtained before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> therapy. This unusual strategy was
        selected to emphasize the differences between pre- and
        post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-exposure expression profiles while minimizing
        differences related to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesion</ENAMEX> and/or patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX>. The complete data set was filtered, letting
        through only genes expressed at ratios <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX> or < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>
        compared to the reference in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> experiment. A
        parameter was applied to the filter that selected genes
        whose fluorescence intensity was above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> in one channel
        at least in one experiment. This arbitrary threshold was
        chosen to exclude genes whose fluorescence intensity was
        close to background fluorescence. To recover possibly
        useful information, this filter was removed if the same
        gene demonstrated high intensity of fluorescence in the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3,000</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> experiment. A
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,393</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,500</NUMEX> clones were selected
        for subsequent analyses.
      
      
        Results
        
          Technical challenges
          Administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> induces dramatic
          changes in the frequency of different subsets of
          circulating cells. These changes need to be addressed
          when considering the more specific and minute changes
          induced at the transcriptional level by this cytokine.
          Perhaps the most perplexing effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> administration
          is a rapid (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>) and paradoxical clearance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> and lymphocytes from the peripheral blood
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). IL-2 may directly eliminate mononuclear
          cells through activation-induced death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Contrary
          to the 
          in vivo observation, however, 
          in vitro stimulation with IL-2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/ml</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> obtained from apheresis of melanoma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not alter mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts,
          suggesting that cell death is not a direct effect of IL-2
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). A substantial difference between
          gradient-separated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> and circulating cells 
          in vivo is the lack of plasma,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelets</ENAMEX> and polymorphonuclear cells as a result of the
          apheresis process. This may directly or indirectly
          contribute to mononuclear cell death 
          in vivo in response to IL-2
          administration. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lU</ENAMEX>/ml) stimulation
          of lepirudin-treated (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aventis Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> did not alter mononuclear cell
          number (data not shown), suggesting a limited role for
          lymphocyte apoptosis as the cause of their rapid
          clearance from the circulation.
          Whatever the reason, the dramatic changes in the
          proportions of different subsets of circulating cells
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> therapy introduce a strong bias into the
          interpretation of the 
          in vivo data. Observed variations
          in gene-expression profile could be due to differential
          gene expression in individual cells, shifting proportions
          of different cell subsets, or a combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
          The effect of proportional shifts in cell subsets could
          not be overcome by 
          ex vivo mechanical separation of
          these subsets because of the limited quantity of material
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> draws (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 ml</NUMEX>). However, density
          gradient separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> almost totally compensated
          for these shifts by eliminating polymorphonuclear cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosinophils</ENAMEX> and basophils (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>), and leaving a
          mononuclear cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comparable with pre-IL-2
          treatment samples. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> from apheresis used as reference
          for 
          in vivo studies and as source of
          cells for 
          in vitro studies are highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in monocytes and lymphocytes, as seen in Figure
          1b.) Therefore, both 
          in vivo and 
          in vitro studies reflected similar
          starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of mononuclear cells. This, at least
          in part, mitigated the variation in gene-profile pattern
          due to shifting cell-subset proportions 
          in vivo. 
          It has been suggested that rapid clearance of
          mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> after IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is due to
          increased permeability of vascular endothelium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
          facilitating cell migration into extravascular spaces
          including tumor sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. However, the level of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed by various subsets of
          mononuclear cells did not change significantly within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor microenvironment</ENAMEX>. Differential display of
          pre-compared with post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> specimens detected changes
          only in circulating cells (that is, of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>,
          CD3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD10 and CD24</TIMEX>; green and gray bars in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>).
          These most probably reflected proportional shifts in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subsets</ENAMEX> rather than altered gene expression, because the
          level of expression of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> remained constant
          in the 
          in vitro time course (data not
          shown). No changes could be detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAs</ENAMEX> obtained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pre-IL-2</ENAMEX> administration compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAs</ENAMEX> obtained 3
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (light-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four</NUMEX> (dark-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>)
          doses. We could not confirm the aRNA-based results by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> because the material obtainable by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNA</ENAMEX> was not sufficient for both analyses. However, we
          have previously shown good correlation between transcript
          detection of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> in aRNA, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          We further evaluated the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on
          endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> permeability as a possible factor
          mediating migration of circulating immune cells into the
          tumor site. IL-2 had no direct impact on the permeability
          of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">umbilical vein endothelial cells</ENAMEX> (HUVEC) (Figure
          1e). The addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> enriched in lymphocytes and
          monocytes by gradient separation increased the
          permeability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>. Treatment of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched PBMC</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/ml</ENAMEX>) increased HUVEC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> (compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> alone) only after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). This finding suggests
          that IL-2 affects endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> permeability through
          activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX>. The delayed effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on
          endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell permeability</ENAMEX> observed with this
          functional assay was supported by gene profiling. IL-2
          alone had minimal effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX>. Supernatant from PBMC
          cultures in serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> had extensive effects on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX> transcriptional profile (data not shown). However,
          supernatants from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> conditioned for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> with IL-2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/ml</ENAMEX>) induced differential expression in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>) that could not be
          induced with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supernatants</ENAMEX> conditioned for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>. These
          results suggest that the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on endothelial
          cells is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediated</ENAMEX> indirectly, through
          activation of immune cells, and occurs at a later stage
          of IL-2 treatment. This conclusion is in line with the
          clinical observation that fluid shifts and vascular leak
          occur in the later phases of high-dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> therapy.
          Taken together, these results suggest that immediate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of mononuclear cells to the tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> is not the primary effector mechanism of
          systemic IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This observation, of
          course, does not exclude the possibility that, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, mononuclear cells might migrate or proliferate at
          the tumor site. The reason for the clearance of
          circulating cells immediately following IL-2
          administration remains unsolved, and may be related to
          their sequestration in the reticular endothelial system,
          a hypothesis that could not be evaluated by this
          study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-course analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced gene
          expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> in vitro
          To assess the direct effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on mononuclear
          cells without the experimental noise caused by
          proportional shifts in cell subsets, we first determined
          the transcriptional changes occurring on exposure of PBMC
          to IL-2 
          in vitro. IL-2 has direct effects
          on immune cells carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 receptor</ENAMEX>, which in turn
          release soluble factors and/or activate other cells by
          cell-cell interactions. Thus, to match as closely as
          possible the 
          in vitro conditions with those
          occurring 
          in vivo, we stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lymphocyte/monocyte-enriched PBMC</ENAMEX> preparations with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IU/ml IL-2</ENAMEX> in serum-free medium. This concentration
          approximates the pharmacokinetic distribution of IL-2
          following intravenous bolus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> with mean peak
          levels around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, corresponding to approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lU</ENAMEX>/ml [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. This time-course analysis identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed more than threefold over pre-IL-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). According to their kinetics of
          expression, the large majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identifiable
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 3 hours</TIMEX> after IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX>, with the
          exception of a subgroup including transcription and
          regulatory factors (c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fos</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MKP1</TIMEX>) which underwent early
          and short-lived upregulation. An overview of the genes
          most consistently affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> therapy revealed a
          large array of transcripts with functions ranging from
          regulation of cell division and apoptosis to the
          secretion of immune-stimulatory and/or pro-inflammatory
          factors. In addition, several surface activation markers
          in lymphocytes and monocytes that may influence migration
          and interaction with other cells were induced. Thus, the
          effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on PBMC <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>, as expected, a broad range
          related to the function of several different types of
          mononuclear cells.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-course analysis of lL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-induced gene
          expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> in vivo
          A similar time-course analysis was performed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who donated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> for the 
          in vitro time course, by obtaining
          blood at intervals following intravenous administration
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/ml</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
          separated by density gradient, which left a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          cells enriched in lymphocytes and monocytes. In the 
          in vivo time course, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          displayed differential expression (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX>-fold change in
          at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the samples) with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> treatment. We then
          compared the expression profiles in the 
          in vivo time course for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>
          genes differentially expressed as a result of IL-2
          exposure during the 
          in vitro time-course analysis.
          Differences between the two data sets could be due to
          shifts in cell-subset frequencies 
          in vivo and/or true alterations in
          the gene-expression profile of individual cells. We
          hypothesized that expression profiles concordant 
          in vitro (where no change in
          cell-subset frequency is observed) and 
          in vivo may represent with most
          confidence the pattern of gene expression induced by
          IL-2. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> concordantly expressed
          in the 
          in vitro and 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments were identified
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3a,3b,3c,3d,3</NUMEX>e) by cluster analysis of the
          combined 
          in vitro and 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">vivo time</TIMEX>-course samples. Genes
          for chemokines and cytokines related to inflammatory
          processes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCP1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/IL-15/IL-3RÎ²</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> receptor) showed a concordant
          early upregulation 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo. Downregulation of growth
          factors/cell cycle/transcription factor-related genes
          (for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERF-2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDC16</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-Myc</ENAMEX>) occurred in a similar fashion 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo. As the majority of genes
          appeared to be concordantly expressed 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo, we postulate that, for
          these at least, the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on gene expression
          overrides its effect on population shift. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the kinetics of expression of individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was noted 
          in vivo, as for the 
          in vitro time course, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-hour</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point appeared to yield the most comprehensive view
          of alterations in gene-expression profile following IL-2
          administration. Thus, this data point was used in a
          larger cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to identify genes consistently
          modulated by IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genes whose expression is consistently altered in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> administration
          The expression pattern of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> identified by
          the 
          in vitro time course was evaluated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> samples obtained <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> after IL-2
          administration in a larger cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> node including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> consistently upregulated
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX>-fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>) was
          identified. Of these genes, all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were included among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> coordinately expressed in the 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo time courses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> node included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> consistently downregulated,
          most of them represented among those coordinately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> in the time-course studies. These data
          suggest that the genes identified were highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the effects of IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> on
          circulating cells.
          For some genes it was possible to extrapolate a
          potential cell subset responsible for their expression by
          testing different mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> subsets separated by
          negative selection after 
          in vitro exposure to IL-2
          (monocytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4- +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells, total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and neutrophils, respectively, under the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Several were selectively expressed
          by either monocytes or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> and/or CD8 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells.
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> also appeared to stimulate the
          expression of some of these genes in neutrophils, which,
          however, could not be accounted for in the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC samples enriched</ENAMEX> in monocytes and lymphocytes and
          almost completely depleted of neutrophils.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> specifically expressed in the tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> in response to IL-2
          administration
          The genes whose expression was consistently altered in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> following IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> were analyzed in a set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAs</ENAMEX> obtained from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> plus an
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Because there
          are practical limits on the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAs</ENAMEX> that can be
          carried out in the same lesion without causing excessive
          disturbance of its structure, we sampled lesions <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>
          after one dose (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> samples in the array) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doses</ENAMEX> (remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> dose
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>) was
          selected as a later point likely to be reached by all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> before treatment was discontinued because of
          limiting toxicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The post-IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNA</ENAMEX> material was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-hybridized</ENAMEX> with reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> obtained pre-IL-2 from
          each lesion as previously discussed. Only a small
          proportion of these genes were consistently upregulated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FNA samples</ENAMEX> and belonged to a closely related
          subcluster consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for inflammatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD-78</ENAMEX>) and interferon-Î³
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX>)-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (guanylate-binding protein
          IFN-inducible, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MxA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>). Analysis of mechanically
          separated subsets related their expression to activation
          of either monocytes or T cells.
          Whereas the previous analysis was based on a pool of
          genes identified by studying the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circulating T</ENAMEX> cells, an independent analysis was carried
          out by selecting, from the complete data set, genes whose
          expression was preferentially altered in FNA samples
          following IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Genes were ranked
          according to their median ratio of expression among all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FNA samples</ENAMEX> (FNAs obtained after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or four</NUMEX> doses were
          pooled together to identify genes associated with IL-2
          administration independent of dose number). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          with the highest median ratio and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> with the lowest
          were selected (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The expression of most of these
          genes seemed to be specifically modulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> and not
          by the trauma of needle aspiration, as only a few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes (in parentheses in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were detected in control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNA</ENAMEX> samples obtained at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> intervals in the absence of IL-2
          administration.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisen</ENAMEX>'s hierarchical clustering analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to this data set to compute relatedness among
          transcriptional profiles of different FNA samples. This
          was done to evaluate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAs</ENAMEX> obtained sequentially
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or four</NUMEX> doses of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">IL-2</NUMEX> from identical or
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> would cluster according to time of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> or tissue of origin. According to this data set,
          based on the most consistently expressed genes, samples
          from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lesion</ENAMEX> clustered together independently of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, suggesting that profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced genes tend
          to be lesion specific throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> therapy. The
          relationship among the samples independent of time of
          treatment was even more robust when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-data set was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">queried</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Different functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subsets</ENAMEX> of
          genes were identified that included those for several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRO-1</ENAMEX>, MIG, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MIP1-Î±</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIP</ENAMEX>-Î²,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>), cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-CR-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1R
          antagonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2RÎ²</ENAMEX>, transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î²</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFÎ²R</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³R</ENAMEX> Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>), adhesion molecules associated
          with mononuclear cell migration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD62L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD64</TIMEX>,
          CD29), cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in granules produced by
          activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocytes</ENAMEX> (grancalcin and calgranulin) and
          several genes associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ activity, such as HLA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">class II</ENAMEX> molecules and IFN-regulatory or responsive genes
          such as those for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MxA, MxB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IRF-1</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, no
          genes associated with apoptosis or cell proliferation
          were identified. In addition, no evidence of migration of
          various immune-cell subsets was observed by analyzing
          changes in frequency of genes constitutively expressed by
          such cells (that is, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14</TIMEX>, and so on, see
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, the early effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> administration
          are more associated with an inflammatory modulation of
          the tumor microenvironment rather than with specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>, activation and/or proliferation of immune
          cells at the tumor site.
          To identify genes whose upregulation in the tumor
          microenvironment was time and/or dose dependent we then
          queried the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNA</ENAMEX> data set by selecting genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed between samples obtained <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or four</NUMEX> doses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (unpaired sample 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test, 
          p 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The cut-off 
          p 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> was arbitrarily
          selected and was not corrected by the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). Thus, the genes identified
          should be considered more as an exploratory finding than
          a definitive proof of differential expression according
          to dose number. Ratios were shown according to the
          central method for display using a normalization factor
          that emphasizes differences in expression between the
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> analyzed by resetting the equality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> (ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to the mean of all the experiments
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. In this fashion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Interestingly, among them we noted a further
          upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>-inducible factors.
          Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> underwent partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>). To explore possible markers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with immune responsiveness we queried the data
          set for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed differentially in the responder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.F. 1</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.F. 4</ENAMEX>) doses of
          IL-2. Two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tail-unequal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>) were carried out comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.F. 1 and M.F. 4</ENAMEX>,
          respectively, with the rest of the FNA samples. Also in
          this case, a cut-off 
          p 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> was arbitrarily
          selected, and was not corrected by the number of genes
          studied. Thus, the findings have only exploratory value.
          In this fashion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68 and 102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified
          respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>), of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> were overlapping
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a nuclear protein
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CHD3</NUMEX>) and a sphingosine kinase type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> isoform). When a
          similar analysis was carried out by comparing each of the
          non-responding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the rest, the average of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dose and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> doses. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the responder lesion after
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> doses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> were identified with the highest
          ratio of expression. Among these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, those for
          NKG5, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> receptor Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> appeared of particular interest because they
          have been found to be upregulated in the context of acute
          rejection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal allografts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. In addition,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2-dependent</TIMEX> NK-cell
          activation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NK4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD62 P-</ENAMEX>selectin, and galectin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, as
          recently observed when purified NK cells were exposed to
          IL-2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Mocellin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.C.P. and F.M.M.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The goal of this study was to dissect the events
        following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">high-dose IL-2</ENAMEX> for therapeutic
        purposes. In particular, we were interested in comparing
        the systemic effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> as reflected by the
        transcriptional profile of circulating mononuclear cells
        with the effects observable within the tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX>. This was achieved by serial sampling of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and tumor samples to follow the dynamic changes
        occurring during the course of IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The
        results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> exerts a broad range of effects
        on circulating cells. These systemic effects have
        downstream repercussions, only a few of which were
        reflected in changes in gene expression at the tumor site.
        Analysis of the genes identified as affected by IL-2
        administration suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> exerts its effect at the
        target site by causing activation of monocytes. This could
        be best explained by the secondary release of
        pro-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Î³ and IL-1</ENAMEX> by
        circulating or intra-tumoral lymphoid cells, as most of the
        genes identified are known to be responsive to the effect
        of either of these cytokines.
        These pro-inflammatory cytokines are probably
        responsible for the direct activation of monocytes, as
        suggested by the upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD64</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1R</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        In addition, gene profiling identified genes whose
        expression is most probably dependent upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³
        rather than IL-2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP70</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MxA</ENAMEX>, MxB
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFN-inducible proteins</ENAMEX>). It is possible that
        macrophage activation is followed by release of
        pro-inflammatory chemokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIP</ENAMEX>-Î² and MIG. These indirect effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor microenvironment</ENAMEX> seem also to affect the activation
        of dendritic cells (DCs) through the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PARC/MCP4.</ENAMEX> Finally, activation of macrophages results in
        the upregulation of the expression of molecules with lytic
        activity, such as calgranulin and grancalcin. Although it
        is possible that the downstream effects noted after IL-2
        administration could be attributed to stimulation of tumor
        cells, exposure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> melanoma cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LF1TU</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">624.38</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A375</ENAMEX>) to supernatant from IL-2-conditioned PBMC
        identified transcriptional changes only in a small
        proportion of these genes (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFNÎ³R2</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²-inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, data not shown). The results,
        therefore, suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> exerts its primary role at
        tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> through the release of pro-inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX>. On the basis of the transcriptional profile
        identified, we postulate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ are the most
        likely cytokines responsible for this phenomenon. These in
        turn activate a local inflammation, probably through
        induction of monocytes and macrophages. This inflammatory
        process can subsequently help recruit immune cells from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periphery</ENAMEX> and/or activate locally infiltrating cells. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is appealing because it converges on IFN-Î³ as a
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of immune regulation within the tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX>. Recent murine experiments have shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ may be the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of immune surveillance in
        the immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. This cytokine could
        possibly also have a central role in therapeutic settings.
        It may have broad downstream effects that according to our
        findings can be best summarized as activation and
        maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monocytes</ENAMEX>/DCs in concert with the release by
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokines</ENAMEX> capable of attracting lymphoid
        cells to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>. These, in turn, may complete the
        activation of cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">monocytic</ENAMEX> lineage, which can
        then switch their function from cross-tolerization to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-priming</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
        A particular subset of genes whose expression appeared
        to be associated with a clinical response was noted.
        Although this observation was based on a single lesion, we
        were surprised to observe among them the genes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NKG5</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (which was upregulated beyond the level noted
        in non-responding samples) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> receptor, which have
        all been recently associated with acute rejection of renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allografts</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Sarwal</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). The
        phenomenon of allograft rejection and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced tumor
        rejection may not only be characterized by the induction of
        a vigorous inflammatory response but share a common
        cytotoxic effector mechanism (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK/T-cell</ENAMEX> degranulation) that
        is ultimately responsible for direct tissue destruction.
        This observation agrees with the suggested synergistic role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ and effector T cells in controlling tumor growth
        in experimental models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. 
        In vitro studies are presently
        ongoing, testing whether the changes in expression profile
        noted in tumor samples following IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> can be
        directly ascribed to the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of this study suggest that IL-2
        administration induces inflammation at the tumor site, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> predominant secondary effects: activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting monocytes; a massive production of
        chemoattractants that may recruit other immune cells to the
        tumor site, among which are the chemokines MIG and PARC
        specific for T cells; and the activation of lytic
        mechanisms ascribable to monocytes (calgranulin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grancalcin</ENAMEX>) and NK cells (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NKG5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NK4</TIMEX>) (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In practical terms, these results suggest that systemic
        IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> may facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> effector function
        in the target organ not by sustaining their proliferation,
        as presently believed, but rather by promoting their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> and by providing a milieu conducive to their
        activation 
        in situ through activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting cells. If this hypothesis is correct,
        then adoptive transfer of effector T cells should follow,
        rather than precede as at present, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">systemic IL-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].

          Selection of the time window and cytokine
          concentration for

          biologically active serum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> levels after
          administration of different doses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
