        Cells of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> grown under
        conditions where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells fail to separate after each
        cell cycle, although the cytoplasm has been
        compartmentalized by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">septum</ENAMEX> formation, produce filaments
        consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> linked end to end [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Such filaments twist as they elongate, writhe, and
        eventually touch themselves. There follows a rapid winding
        up of the filament into a double-strand helix by a process
        of supercoiling that is triggered by the impediment of the
        twisting motions that accompany cell growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
        cells in double-strand helical structures also twist as
        they grow. Their motions cause the double-strand structure
        itself to twist. Constraints on twisting again result in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">writhing</ENAMEX>, touching, and supercoiling. The product is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-strand helical structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . A mature macrofiber
        arises by the repetition of the growth, twisting, and
        supercoiling process. The final structure is millimeters in
        length and contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> filament
        strands twisted together into a coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> with loops
        at both ends. The handedness of the initial double-strand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helix</ENAMEX> is preserved throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> morphogenesis
        suggesting that each cycle of supercoiling is a result of
        negative twist rather than simple over tightening of the
        previous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helical form</ENAMEX> into a positive supercoil [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macrofiber</ENAMEX> self-assembly ceases when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> become
        too stiff to supercoil into a plectoneme as a result of the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell filaments</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber shaft</ENAMEX>. Cell growth
        continues beyond this point however forcing the fiber shaft
        to supercoil into a free standing helix that contracts into
        a ball-like form [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Filaments that grow on the surface
        of a ball can buckle and initiate the outgrowth of fibers
        that remain anchored to the ball surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These too
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supercoil</ENAMEX> when they reach a critical length or when they
        encounter an external impediment to their twisting. In
        either case supercoiling draws an outgrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> back
        onto the surface of the ball resulting in an expansion of
        it's diameter.
        Macrofiber-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> are slightly denser
        than the complex fluid growth medium, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX>, in which fibers
        are produced [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Lacking functional flagella they
        settle to the floor of the growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> and move as a
        result of growth or convection currents in the fluid.
        Growth with twisting is the predominant cause of motions
        that take place during macrofiber morphogenesis and the
        production of the two-dimensional patterns of larger
        structures described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. Helix-hand specific
        pivoting motions of macrofibers and their walking over
        glass and plastic surfaces using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> generated by cell
        growth have been described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . These
        motions coupled with the joining of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to one
        another upon contact govern the spacing distances between
        structures in a population situated on a solid surface.
        Unlike other spacing mechanisms found in procaryotes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrofiber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> appears to be a ramification solely of
        mechanics dictated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of cells in
        multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and their growth geometry.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-lapse video films of macrofiber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> grown
        as static cultures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> mm diameter plastic petri dishes
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> medium were used to analyze the
        locations where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were positioned on the floor of
        the petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>, and the factors responsible for the
        patterns formed by them. The cultures studied were
        inoculated by sterile toothpick transfer from mature fibers
        grown in the same medium. A random number of fiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> was generated by the transfer process, each below
        the resolution of the optical system used to produce the
        films. These grew and self-assembled into macrofibers that
        could be seen distributed throughout the available surface
        area of the petri dish floor. When growth was allowed to
        continue undisturbed beyond the fiber stage the final
        populations contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 10</NUMEX> fold fewer multicellular
        structures than the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> that could be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> initially. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1illustrates</TIMEX> that joining of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> to one another was responsible for the reduction in
        their numbers, for the large increased mass of the final
        structures compared to the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and for the
        eventual spatial pattern observed. In Figure 1about 10
        structures can be resolved at the earliest time shown
        [frame <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">167 minutes</TIMEX> later [frame <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
        multi-fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> remained in the same area.
        Additional file 1shows the source film from which these
        frames were obtained. The growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in this
        culture measured by the rate of length increase was
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 96 minutes</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold reduction
        in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> was achieved therefore in less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> generations. The results shown in Figure
        1suggest moreover that the scale of the final spatial
        pattern must be governed by initial fiber density in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the length to which fibers grow.
        The joining of macrofibers to one another is a
        growth-dependent process driven by twist and supercoiling.
        It requires <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber-fiber</ENAMEX> contact that impedes the free
        twisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. Depending upon the
        geometry of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that make contact and
        whether or not both ends of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are prevented
        from rotating, contact results in either entwining of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or supercoiling that gives rise to a ball-like form
        consisting of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2illustrates</NUMEX> the
        joining of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fiber fragments by the formation of a
        functional butt splice. The fragments shown are typical of
        those produced by toothpick transfer of a mature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> into
        fresh medium. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> filaments protruding from the
        ends of both fragment shafts became entwined with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another. The newly spliced structure behaved as a
        single mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in all it's subsequent behavior,
        including an experimentally induced helix hand inversion
        during which all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell filaments</ENAMEX> in the fiber's shaft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unwound</ENAMEX> then twisted back together in the opposite helix
        hand. Additional file 2shows the dynamics of splice
        formation and helix hand inversion. The maintenance of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">inversion</TIMEX> illustrates that joining by
        entwining creates a strong linkage between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. Joining by entwining also occurs when intact
        mature macrofibers with loops at their ends meet [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The resulting structures are irregular in diameter along
        their length reflecting differences in the diameter and/or
        topology of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. Though irregular,
        joined structures of this sort are nevertheless
        mechanically sound and capable of continued self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        They progress to mature ball-forms just as clonal fibers
        grown in isolation do.
        Large and structurally complex macrofibers form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> rather than elongated ones as a result
        of supercoiling. Compare the geometry of forms in frames 1
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The ball-like forms produced by joining
        of large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are much more sedentary than their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX>. Figure 3illustrates this. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> large immobile
        structures are shown. The paths taken by precursor fibers
        leading to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> and joining reveal the distances
        and directions travelled in the formation of each aggregate
        structure. For example, several of the initial 6 fibers
        that eventually became the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large ball-form aggregate
        shown on the upper left of Figure 3traversed a distance of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm from their initial positions to their final location
        in the aggregate structure. They moved over this distance
        either by "walking" over the plastic surface of the petri
        dish [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] until they met <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another, or by being
        "dragged" from one location to another as a result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supercoiling</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Structures too large to move
        themselves by walking can still be dragged from one
        location to another as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4provided</NUMEX> they
        acquire an extended fiber attached to their surface. In the
        case shown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> too large to walk were drawn
        together by the supercoiling of an extended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> that
        bridged between them. To begin with, the extended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> had
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> free end capable of rotating as it grew. When rotation
        of the free end was prevented by contact with the second
        large ball structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">supercoiling</ENAMEX> was induced. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        structures were then drawn together by the contraction in
        length that accompanies supercoiling. See Additional file
        3for an overview of the dragging process.
        The static fluid cultures used in the experiments
        reported here always appear to develop internal fluid
        motions even though the external environment is held at
        constant temperature. These convection currents can carry
        macrofibers with them, and can even move large ball-like
        structures. Figure 5shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> frames taken from late stages
        of pattern formation in the same culture superimposed upon
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5were</NUMEX> false colored
        to permit identification of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (black) and later
        (white) time points. A comparison of the two frames shows
        numerous examples of neighboring black structures joining
        to form a single white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The directions of the
        joining motions have no preferred orientation in the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In contrast, comparison of the direction single
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> moved to their later white locations
        reveals that many paths taken are parallel to one another
        and in the same orientation. Smaller structures moreover
        moved over greater distances in the same time interval than
        did larger structures. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of this sort are
        found in many cultures. They arise late in a culture's
        history apparently from filaments shed from large mature
        structures. Film sequences from other cultures show small
        late-arising structures moving over great distances amongst
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that remain in place or move only very
        slightly. These observations indicate that convection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">currents</ENAMEX> must:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX> contribute to the motions fibers undergo in the early
        stages of pattern formation, and thus enhance the chances
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> make contact with each other, and
        ii. influence the final locations structures assume in
        the patterns.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional spatial patterns of ball-form
        structures have been characterized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> macrofiber
        cultures designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">916</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">920</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points were
        analysed from each culture: an early time when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were
        in the initial stages of ball formation but still capable
        of self-generated translational motions caused by twisting
        and supercoiling, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX> when large ball forms
        were situated at or very close to their final positions.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> images analyzed are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. In each pair
        of frames the total number of structures present at the
        later time is less than that present at the early time as a
        result of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> joining. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">637</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are present in all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> images. In order to determine whether structures are
        uniformly randomly distributed in the space available for
        each culture the observed distributions were compared to
        those expected on the basis of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grid</ENAMEX> was superimposed over each image (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) and used
        to obtain the frequency of squares within which there were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1, 2</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution was used
        to predict the expected frequency for similar randomly
        distributed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> spaced uniformly in the same area.
        Both the observed and theoretical expected distributions
        are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. There are significantly fewer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grid</ENAMEX>-squares that do not contain any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the
        observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> than would be the case if the pattern
        was random. Similarly, there are more grid-squares that
        contain a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> than
        would be anticipated if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were positioned
        solely by chance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. To validate the
        significance of these differences we performed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi</ENAMEX>-squared comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        They are significantly different and the Ï‡ 2tests show that
        the probability of the observed distribution being uniform
        is very small.
        The distances separating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> from all their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nearest neighbors</ENAMEX> were determined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The
        results shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2were</ENAMEX> derived from a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">519</NUMEX>
        structures consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1451</TIMEX> lengths measured between
        neighboring pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (called links). The mean
        distances separating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> cm
        in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The overall mean for all pair-wise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.73</NUMEX> cm. The variation in separation distances
        within a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> can be examined by ordering all
        the separation distances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> from shortest to
        longest and plotting them as a function of distance. Curves
        such as those shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7are</NUMEX> obtained. The majority
        of points fall on straight lines the slopes and intercepts
        of which are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The separation distances
        between pairs become more uniform in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with
        greater numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, as seen by the correlation
        between lower slopes and higher numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. A
        similar measurement of link lengths was carried out in
        theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> distributed at random in the same
        space using a random number generator to assign x and y
        coordinates for each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Link lengths in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> also become more uniform as a function
        of object density in the population suggesting that
        improved uniformity of spacing in denser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is not
        a ramification of the mechanism responsible for the
        patterns found in macrofiber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-intercept values listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2represent</ENAMEX> the
        shortest distances separating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. These values have been used in a model that
        predicts the observed distributions based upon the idea
        that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> initially located within an area
        related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-intercept value coalesce into a single
        structure. The following assumptions are made:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX> the starting structures are uniformly randomly
        distributed;
        ii. a grid pattern with grid square size related to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-intercept value is superimposed upon the distribution of
        structures, these are termed "capture squares";
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>. all starting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> within each capture square
        coalesce, resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> categories of grid squares:
        those with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and those with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in them.
        For an initial average number of starting structures per
        capture square 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , the proportion of capture squares
        expected to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> coalesced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX>) e -
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , so that the proportion expected
        to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> coalesced structure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - e - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> . Larger grid squares, termed
        "measuring grid squares" of any dimension can also be
        superimposed upon the same pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and the
        probabilities of finding r coalesced structures (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1,2</NUMEX>,
        ... n) in the measuring squares that are n times as large
        as capture squares are, assuming that events in each
        capture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are independent of those in any other, given
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binomial</ENAMEX>) by:

        The "fit" is clearly better than for a uniform

        choosing a better ratio of measuring square area to capture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">square</ENAMEX> area. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> shows the expected frequencies

        Discussion
        The work described here focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        multicellular bacterial forms in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> resting on a
        solid surface beneath a fluid growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>. Although
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have no conventional
        mechanisms of motility their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multicellular</ENAMEX> derivatives
        become dispersed in the space available forming patterns of
        unique scale and non-random character. Neither chemotactic
        processes, nor directed growth appear to be at play.
        Instead the ultimate patterns achieved are derived from the
        growth geometry of individual cells. Using the same basic
        mechanism that links cell growth geometry to macrofiber
        self-assembly we interpret the production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional
        pattern as an outcome of motions derived from cell growth
        operating at the level of a macrofiber and the joining of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrofibers</ENAMEX> to form higher order aggregates that
        have their own unique constraints. Both stochastic and
        determined events are involved. Unlike other bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in fluid cultures one ends up in the macrofiber
        system with condensed multiclonal structures of high cell
        density separated from one another according to rules based
        upon the ramifications of twisting and supercoiling of
        elastic filaments.
        In macrofibers there is an hierarchical relationship
        between cell growth geometry, the behavior of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX> and bundles of filaments and the movement of
        macrofibers over solid surfaces. Individual cells, and
        consequently cell filaments also, twist as they elongate,
        encounter constraints on their twisting and supercoiling is
        an inevitable outcome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of twisting elastic
        filaments assure self-assembly so long as the integrity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell filament</ENAMEX>, the backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall peptidoglycan</ENAMEX>,
        and the electrostatic structure of the cell wall polymers
        is maintained. Fiber self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> has its limits however
        set by both physiological and mechanical constraints. There
        is a time course therefore when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are formed, mature,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">condense</ENAMEX> to ball-like forms and ultimately decay.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> go beyond this clonal scenario by
        joining with one another and positioning the aggregate
        forms in patterns. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twisting</ENAMEX> and supercoiling are the key
        mechanisms responsible for these processes as well. In
        other words joining and positioning also require cell
        growth of a particular geometry.
        Twisting motions enable macrofibers to join either by
        butt splicing or by parallel joining of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber shafts</ENAMEX> as
        a result of entwining. The case shown in Figure
        2illustrates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> can join by
        entwining at the level of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell filaments</ENAMEX> in a
        manner similar to the early stages of clonal macrofiber
        formation. Supercoiling motions are responsible for:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX> fiber folding during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">morphogenesis</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        ii. fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> over solid surfaces [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>. the conversion of extended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> into compact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>-form structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>. the dragging of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> together which
        leads to their fusion into a aggregate multiclonal forms
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
        The cell surfaces that are brought into contact with one
        another by these processes show no signs of repulsion even
        when tightly pressed together by twisting and supercoiling,
        yet they do not bond together in a manner that prevents
        their sliding over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other during growth and movement. No
        obvious signs of attraction have been seen in many films
        examined that show pattern formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Nor is
        there any evidence that directed growth plays a role in
        bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> close enough to each other for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> to
        be made. Rather it appears that random motions in high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">density populations</ENAMEX> position structures so that contact is
        inevitable as a result of growth motions. Once contact is
        made the laws of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> governing the behavior of
        twisting elastic filaments come into play and eventually a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional pattern emerges (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> features of the ultimate or penultimate
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional patterns formed by the positioning of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>-form macrofiber aggregate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have been
        characterized here: their non-uniform randomness, and the
        spacing distributions of nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. The former
        appears to be a ramification of the surface area within
        which fiber contacts can be made, itself governed by fiber
        length and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber mobility</ENAMEX>. In late stages of pattern
        formation exclusion zones within which no other structures
        may exist become established surrounding each large
        structure. Any extended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> that protrudes from the
        periphery of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> pivots about its anchor
        point as it grows and makes contact with the floor of the
        petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>. The path travelled by the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>(s)
        is governed by its helix hand (clockwise for right-handed,
        counter-clockwise for left-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>). The motion
        itself is caused by rolling and/or walking over the floor
        of the petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>. During its sweep around the anchoring
        structure an extended peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> has the potential to
        drag any other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> it encounters to the surface of
        the anchoring structure thereby creating an exclusion zone.
        Exclusion zones are not perfect however. Peripheral fibers
        seldom sweep a full <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">360 degrees</NUMEX> around a given structure
        before they either encounter another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and
        supercoil pulling the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> together or simply supercoil
        themselves onto the ball surface. Arcs may be left
        therefore that have not been cleared of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. In
        addition peripheral fibers cease to function as a culture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX> consequently a very late arising structure that
        happens into an exclusion zone can develop there into a
        mature structure. This is a very infrequent process
        however, easily detected in the film sequences, and did not
        occur during formation of any of the patterns analyzed
        here.
        A mathematical model has been developed that predicts
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dimensional spatial distribution patterns of
        objects in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that behave as macrofibers do. The
        key assumption is that all objects located within a capture
        zone join one another. Using minimum link lengths found in
        observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> to scale the dimensions of the capture
        zone the model was able to predict distributions that
        closely match those found in the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). These findings strengthen the contention that
        the condensation of macrofibers confined spatially into
        single aggregate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is the essential mechanisms of
        pattern formation in macrofiber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Finally mention must be made of the role convection
        currents play in the establishment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional
        patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. There is no question that
        convection currents move small and even large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        In early stages of pattern formation when structures are
        very small and close to each other it is very likely that
        fluid flows do result in contacts that lead to joining. As
        structures grow larger and become multiclonal they no
        longer appear to be dominated by fluid currents and as
        their density in the population decreases chance
        positioning by convection becomes less likely. Walking,
        self-assembly motions, and supercoiling now dominate
        movements leading to chance contacts. Joining by dragging
        becomes the dominant mode at the latest stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patterning</ENAMEX>. Eventually the density of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is at its lowest and the aggregate structures
        are very large, hence moved only slowly if at all by fluid
        motions. Once the culture reaches a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> where growth of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is no longer in the organized fiber form,
        bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> together by any means is unlikely to
        result in their joining. The natural limit in pattern
        formation corresponds therefore to the time when there is
        no longer organized multicellular growth in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Populations</ENAMEX> of bacterial macrofibers cultured in fluid
        medium without agitation produce aggregate multicellular
        structures distributed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-dimensional patterns on the
        floor of the growth chamber although the cells have no
        flagellar-driven motility. The geometry of individual cell
        growth is ultimately responsible for the observed patterns.
        Upon contact growing structures join one another using
        forces associated with twisting and supercoiling. The final
        result is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of large sedentary aggregate
        structures separated from one another by surrounding zones
        of fluid medium that are free of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. The scale of
        the pattern is set by the lengths to which mature
        macroflbers grow. A mathematical model based upon the
        coalescence of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> initially located in
        proximity to each other is able to accurately predict the
        actual distributions found experimentally.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis strain FJ7</ENAMEX> has been
        described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . It may be grown as either
        left- or right-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macroflbers</ENAMEX> with a range of twist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> depending upon imposed environmental conditions.
        Young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> produced in the standard complex medium, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX>,
        were used as the starting material for all experiments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> and growth conditions. The complex medium, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX>,
        consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g Bacto Tryptose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g Bacto Beef</ENAMEX>

        . Static cultures were housed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">standard 100</TIMEX> mm style
        diameter plastic Petri dishes (actual diameter of the floor
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> mm). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Right-handed fibers</ENAMEX> were produced by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>
        growth in 10ml <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM MgSO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C</TIMEX>. A single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was disrupted
        by toothpick transfer to fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> medium. Cultures grown
        for study at low magnification were placed on an elevated
        glass plate suspended above a black surface that was housed
        in a plexiglass chamber. The temperature on top of the
        glass plate was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24Â°C</TIMEX>. Cultures used for higher
        magnification studies were grown on the stage of an Olympus
        SZ-Tr stereo zoom microscope housed in the same plexiglass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lighting</ENAMEX> was indirect from below using a source
        outside of the microscope to prevent temperatures from
        rising above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24Â°C</TIMEX>. The culture from which Figure 2was
        obtained was grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> medium lacking additional
        magnesium sulfate. It was incubated on the stage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>
        inverted phase contrast microscope and maintained at 48Â°C
        using an electrical heating/cooling device (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambion</ENAMEX>,

        Video film production and analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-lapse video
        films were produced at low magnification showing an entire
        Petri dish culture from above using a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cohu</ENAMEX> charged-coupled
        device camera fitted with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fujinon</ENAMEX> TV zoom lens (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175/75</NUMEX> mm) to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffen</ENAMEX> closeup lenses were added as
        needed. Higher magnification films were obtained using
        either the stereo zoom microscope described above, or a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> inverted phase contrast microscope. Films obtained
        from the latter were initially recorded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> mm film using
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolex</ENAMEX> camera controlled by a time-lapse system. The films
        were later transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHS</ENAMEX> video format for analysis.
        All other films produced using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohu</ENAMEX> cameras were recorded
        either with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GYYR</ENAMEX> time-lapse video VHS tape deck (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odetics</ENAMEX>)
        or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JVC</ENAMEX> time-lapse tape deck. In either case date and time
        stamps were written onto each frame by the tape deck.
        Images were transferred to a PC using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Matrox</ENAMEX> software
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrox Graphics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>) and analyzed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrox</ENAMEX> and
        Image <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pro Plus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Cybernetics</ENAMEX>) programs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>
        Photoshop program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems</ENAMEX>) was used to assemble the
