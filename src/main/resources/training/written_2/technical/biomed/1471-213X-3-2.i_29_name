        Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins that function in
        intracellular signaling pathways to regulate a variety of
        developmental processes including cell growth, cell
        differentiation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell polarity</ENAMEX>, and apoptosis.
        Mis-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling leads to the development of
        several human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, including colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanoma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canonical Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling initiates in the
        binding of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> ligand to its cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the frizzled gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, along with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-receptor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LRP5/6</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , leading to changes in the
        activities of cytoplasmic effectors resulting in the
        stabilization of beta-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Beta-catenin then
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulates</ENAMEX> in the nucleus where it interacts with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcriptional</ENAMEX> co-activators, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the Lymphoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEF/TCF</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX> group <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding proteins</ENAMEX> to regulate gene
        expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Many downstream gene targets of the
        canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway have been identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stke</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
        There is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> ligands and not all Wnts
        are thought to function in the same pathway. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> can be
        operationally separated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes; the first being a
        class that transforms C57mg <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> mammary epithelial cells
        and also promotes duplication of the dorso-ventral axis
        when over-expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> embryos. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> in this
        functional class activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-3A</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> functional group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> does not transform C57mg cells nor promote axis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>. Instead, when over-expressed in frog or fish
        embryos, these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wnts</ENAMEX> perturb the movements of gastrulation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> have been shown to signal in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-canonical Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling pathway, the Wnt/Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+pathway
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-4, -11</ENAMEX>). The Wnt/Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        increase intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+levels in zebrafish embryos [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        ] and to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamKII</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> embryos [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ]
        as well as in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanomas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, it may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activate Cdc42</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . It is important to
        emphasize that whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> activate distinct responses and
        likely pathways is context-dependent, and thus in other
        contexts a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> may activate another pathway.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vertebrate Wnts</ENAMEX> signal through frizzled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that
        in some experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contexts</ENAMEX> (e.g., without co-expressing
        LRP5<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX>) preferentially activate the Wnt/beta-catenin or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt/Ca 2</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> may couple
        to either pathway depending on which frizzled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is
        present. When co-expressed with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frizzled-5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-5a
        can induce a secondary axis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In other
        assays, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat frizzled</ENAMEX> 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX>)
        increases intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+levels and activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamKII</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . The activation of Wnt/Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+signaling by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> seems to be antagonistic to the canonical
        Wnt signaling pathway. Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> expression
        inhibits ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-8</ENAMEX> induction of secondary axis
        formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> embryos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Supportingly, the
        endogenous expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> maintains C57mg <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in a
        normal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>sense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> mimics Wnt-1
        transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C57mg cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . This data suggests
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> work in an opposing manner in some
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>. This potential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> as a tumor
        suppressor is further supported by the evidence that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ectopic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uroepithelial cells</ENAMEX> prevents
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> when injected into athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nude mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Much is still unknown about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> signals and,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, whether it regulates any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The ability of
        dnWnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to block expression of some genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        and the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> to activate the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensitive
        transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , support the likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> can
        regulate gene expression through a beta-catenin-independent
        mechanism. We sought to identify genes regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-5a
        and compare whether these were different from canonical
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene targets using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis.
      
      
        Results
        To identify downstream genes regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wnt-5a</TIMEX> we
        created C57mg cells that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stably</ENAMEX> express both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and
        Rfz-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, a potential ligand and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> pair that in some
        assays function in the same signaling pathway. We
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
        order to augment the activation of noncanonical Wnt
        signaling. Both have been shown to elevate intracellular Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+levels and to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamKII</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> have been shown to synergize in
        their induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamKII</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/C57mg</NUMEX> cells were
        also used for comparison, in an effort to identify genes
        preferentially regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>. C57mg <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appeared to
        respond to ectopic expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> in
        C57mg cells since the cells exhibited a moderate reduction
        in growth rate in comparison to wildtype (wt) C57mg cells
        as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells (data not shown).
        Phenotypically the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells were more
        spread out and the overall size of the cells increased
        compared to wt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C57mg cells</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells (data not
        shown). In contrast, ectopic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> induced
        the expected morphological transformation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells
        (data not shown). Previous reports of ectopic expression of
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> to be
        highly transforming whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> failed to induce
        transformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . By identifying downstream
        targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX>, we wanted to determine which
        genes are responsible for these phenotypic changes as well
        as which genes might be targets of noncanonical Wnt
        signaling.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from wt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells stably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transformed by Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">retroviruses</ENAMEX>, and C57mg
        cells stably transformed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> retrovirus were used for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis. Biotinylated cRNA probes
        synthesized from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were hybridized to Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mouse GeneChips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mu11k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subA</ENAMEX> and subB arrays. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX>
        oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were analysed including known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> independent sets of experiments were
        performed that initiated from the growth of cells. Probe
        sets that underwent a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater change in the
        Wnt-ligand expressing cells compared to control cells were
        selected for further analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that repeated
        in both experiments appeared to change in the
        Wnt-expressing cells. Of those, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were chosen for
        validation by an independent method (quantitative RT-PCR).
        A list of some of these genes, with the observed
        fold-changes determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, is shown (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; list of primers
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Genes are separated by functional
        categories with the greatest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having roles
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>, transcriptional regulation, and
        signaling. The list of genes shows those that are specific
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2</ENAMEX>, differential between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2</ENAMEX> and
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX>, and common to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2</ENAMEX>. Previously identified genes regulated by Wnt
        signaling in this list include fibronectin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , groucho related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , and
        Krox-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wnt-5a</TIMEX> may couple to more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frizzled</ENAMEX> receptor, different Wnt signaling pathways may
        be activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> depending on the endogenous
        expression of various frizzled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 10</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        it is possible that the gene expression pattern we
        identified may be due to the activation of both canonical
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noncanonical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling pathways. We compared the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2</ENAMEX> expression profile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> expression
        profile to rule out genes common in both pathways and to
        identify those genes specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rfz</ENAMEX>-2.
        We next wanted to examine whether any of these genes
        were regulated in a similar manner if we used alternative
        methods for expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>. In particular, we
        wanted to activate the function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wnts</ENAMEX> for short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">durations</ENAMEX> rather than relying on stable expression. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approach was to co-culture C57mg cells with cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreting Wnt</ENAMEX> ligand. For the co-culture experiments, C57mg
        cells were grown together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> expressing
        293T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated and quantitative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using primers to the list of genes
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The majority of genes had little if any
        background in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions from the human 293T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gene, mesothelin, exhibited a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold induction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C57mg cells</ENAMEX> treated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> but
        not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> secreting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">293T cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A).
        This fold change was similar to the data obtained from
        stable expression with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesothelin</ENAMEX> is a cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> of unknown function
        that is expressed in the mesothelium. It is synthesized as
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> kDa precursor that is proteolytically processed into a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kDa membrane bound form that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</ENAMEX> (GPI)-linked and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> kDa
        secreted form. The secreted form has been referred to as
        megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF) for its ability to
        stimulate the megakaryocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> forming activity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">murine IL-3</ENAMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Mesothelin expression is induced in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
        including ovarian, pancreatic, lung, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . The soluble portion of mesothelin has drawn
        attention as a potential serum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor marker</ENAMEX> since it is
        highly over-expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with ovarian carcinomas
        and pancreatic adenocarcinomas [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        Stromelysin-1 (SL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was induced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 2</NUMEX>-fold in C57mg
        cells co-cultured with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> secreting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">293T cells</ENAMEX> but not
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> secreting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">293T cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A). A
        similar level of induction was also observed with
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a/293</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> cells co-cultured with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells (data
        not shown), suggesting that the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> is due to
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX>. These data are
        similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4</NUMEX> fold induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> is a matrix
        metalloproteinase that can alter ECM-mediated signaling
        events during development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> have roles in mammary gland development and are
        elevated in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] ,
        although <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> is reduced in other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wnt-5a</TIMEX> may activate both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wnt</ENAMEX> pathways
        we turned to an approach that more specifically would
        transiently activate the Wnt/Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+signaling pathway. This
        approach involves the use of a drug-inducible chimeric
        receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane
        spanning portions derived from the hamster Î²

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> AR) and the intracellular domains
        derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> has previously been shown
        to elevate intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamKII</ENAMEX> in a
        ligand-dependent manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 37 38</ENAMEX> ] . C57mg cells stably
        transformed with Rfz-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/Î²</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> retrovirus or wt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells were
        treated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> with propranolol, a Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> antagonist, to maintain the
        chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in an inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Subsequently,
        the Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> agonist isoproterenol was added for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> at which point <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated and quantitative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed. Supporting the co-culture data
        discussed above, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a 3</NUMEX>-fold induction
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isoproterenol</ENAMEX> treated Rfz-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/Î²</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> AR expressing C57mg cells but not wt
        C57mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with isoproterenol (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, panel
        B).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> appears to be up-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and not Wnt-1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Figure 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A). Conversely, mesothelin
        appears to be up-regulated specifically by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mesothelin</TIMEX> was not induced by co-culturing
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> secreting cells or by activation of the
        chimeric Rfz-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/Î²</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX> receptor (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, panels A and
        B). To our knowledge this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report to show that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are differentially regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> within the same cell type.
        In order to examine the mechanism by which Wnt-1 or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> regulates mesothelin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX>, respectively, C57mg
        cells were treated with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LiCl</ENAMEX> or phorbol myristic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> (PMA). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LiCl</ENAMEX> has previously been shown to mimic
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> signaling by stabilizing beta-catenin
        through its inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3Î²
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK-3Î²</ENAMEX>), a kinase that phosphorylates beta-catenin and
        promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . C57mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LiCl</ENAMEX> exhibited
        elevated levels of mesothelin but not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, left
        panel). On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX> treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">elevated SL-1</ENAMEX> transcript levels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold but not mesothelin
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>, a phorbol ester, activates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and has previously been shown to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SL-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        It appears that mesothelin is activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX>, which can
        be mimicked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LiCl</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> is activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-5a
        in a beta-catenin-independent manner, which can be mimicked
        by activating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis to identify genes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regulated by Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells. C57mg cells
        were chosen since they become transformed by ectopic
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and by loss of function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2 C57mg</ENAMEX> cells exhibited
        phenotypic differences from wt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C57mg cells</ENAMEX> (see results).
        We focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that showed differential regulation
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> since their regulation was reproducible
        using several methods to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, mesothelin, was up-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-1
        both by stable expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells and by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-culturing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57mg</ENAMEX> cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> secreting cells.
        Similarly, mesothelin expression was induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li+</ENAMEX>, an
        inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK-3Î²</ENAMEX>, that mimics <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesothelin</ENAMEX> is
        markedly over-expressed in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> derived
        from tissues of the mesothelium, including lung, cervix,
        and pancreas. Interestingly, mesothelin expression is
        induced in lung, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinomas where
        constitutive activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling is caused by
        stabilizing mutations in beta-catenin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ]
        . The induction of mesothelin in these carcinomas may be
        due to misregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling as are other targets
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> pathway, c-myc and cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>. Mutations in
        different effectors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling have been identified
        in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-5a
        down-regulated mesothelin expression, perhaps through
        antagonism of endogenous Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> was up-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> lines of evidence demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> signaling. First,
        C57mg cells stably expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> elevate SL-1
        levels. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second C57mg</NUMEX> cells co-cultured with Wnt-5a
        secreting cells up-regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors stably</ENAMEX> expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57mg</NUMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">augment SL-1</ENAMEX> expression. To further examine how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>, we tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SL-1</ENAMEX> induction
        could be mediated by downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX> of Wnt/Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+signaling such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX>. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX> treatment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C57mg cells</ENAMEX> did indeed elevate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> levels
        significantly. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> is an important modulator of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> through its function as a matrix metalloproteinase
        that degrades the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> induction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p2S</NUMEX> cells, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">untransformed</ENAMEX> mouse mammary epithelial cell line, triggered
        the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cadherin</ENAMEX> and beta-catenin from
        cell-cell junctions and reduced the expression of
        beta-catenin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> may play similar
        roles in inhibiting cadherin-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-adhesion, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> decreases Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion similar to a
        dominant negative cadherin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The regulation of SL-1
        by Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX> may be important in developmental processes such
        as gastrulation where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> affects the morphogenetic
        movement of tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
        Whether mesothelin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX> are direct targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>, respectively, and whether alterations in their
        expression are responsible for the observed phenotypic
        changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a/Rfz-2/C57mg</ENAMEX> cells, has yet to be
        determined. Whether they are direct or indirect does not
        alter the observation that the expression of both change in
        an unexpected manner in response to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX>. Much
        less is understood about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> signaling pathway(s) and
        how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> signals are transmitted to the nucleus to affect
        gene expression compared to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin
        signaling pathway. A recent report demonstrated that Wnt-5a
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rfz-2</ENAMEX> can induce the nuclear localization of the
        transcription factor NF-AT [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Their results show that
        NF-AT is a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of the Wnt/Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+pathway and
        antagonizes the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in Xenopus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> has putative NF-AT binding sites
        but whether these are important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> regulation
        requires further testing. Nevertheless, our data clearly
        demonstrate that different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wnts</ENAMEX> have distinct effects on
        gene expression in a single cell line.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis we identified several
        genes that are differentially regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1 and Wnt</ENAMEX>-5a
        signaling within the same cell type, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C57mg</TIMEX>. We focused on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, mesothelin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX>, whose regulation by Wnts
        was reproducible using a variety of methods to activate the
        Wnt signaling pathways. Mesothelin, a potential tumor serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>, was up-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt-1</ENAMEX> and down-regulated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SL-1</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matrix metalloproteinase</ENAMEX>, was up-regulated
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wnt-5a</TIMEX> only, showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-5a</ENAMEX> can indeed affect gene
        expression. Our data indicate that different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wnts</ENAMEX> can
        stimulate distinct sets of genes.

          Biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complementary RNA</ENAMEX> (cRNA) was then

          with the use of T7 polymerase. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼g</NUMEX> of biotinylated cRNA
          were then randomly sheared (to an approximate length of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 nucleotides</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> to the arrays and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-pass analysis of the scanned data were performed at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAN Facility</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reverse Transcriptase-PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Confirmation of gene expression was performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. cDNA was created from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThermoScript RT-PCR System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 primer.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minus RT</ENAMEX> controls were also
          prepared similarly. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were included in each
          reaction in a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The reaction was
          performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> and terminated by incubating
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. The reaction was diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>-fold
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Î</NUMEX>¼l were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction to
          yield a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼l</NUMEX>. Since nonspecific
          amplification was obtained in testing some of the primers
          sets with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-RT</ENAMEX> controls, optimization of the primer
          concentration was performed as per the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR</ENAMEX> green PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> concentrations of
          each of the forward and reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were used, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nM,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> nM, to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> different
          combinations. The amplification reaction was performed
          using the following thermocycler conditions: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">94Â°C</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX>, and 72Â°C 30 s. +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>, -RT, and no template controls were
          tested for the primer concentration optimization and
          samples were taken out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 25, 30 and 35</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> to run
          on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gels. The combination of forward and
          reverse primer concentrations was selected based on the
          presence of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> only in the +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> sample. Using
          the optimized primer concentrations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction was
          performed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green PCR</ENAMEX> Master <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prism 7700 Sequence Detector</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>). The amplification reaction
          consisted of the following: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, denaturation
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> thermal cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">95Â°C</ENAMEX> for
          15 s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min. PCR</TIMEX> quantification was performed
          in triplicate. Fold induction was obtained by using the
          Î”Î”C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> method in which all samples are
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> normalized to the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> hypoxanthine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphoribosyltransferase</ENAMEX> (HPRT) in each sample. Relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were then compared between the
          experimental sample and its control. The primer sequences
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. To determine the specificity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> sets to the murine mesothelin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SL-1</ENAMEX> targets
          genes, we performed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using the primers sets with cDNA
          from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">293T cells</ENAMEX>, and found no amplification.
