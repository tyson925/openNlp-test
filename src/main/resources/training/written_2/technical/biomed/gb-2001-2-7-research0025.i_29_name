        The sequence of the human nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> has been
        completed in draft form by an international public
        consortium consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> computational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. A private
        commercial version of the genome has also been sequenced
        and assembled using a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome shotgun</ENAMEX> approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Many lower organisms have been sequenced to date [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], but
        the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pair (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> times as large as the largest currently
        finished genomes - 
        Drosophila melanogaster at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">megabases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and 
        Arabidopsis thaliana at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>].
        As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2000</TIMEX>, the public human sequence was primarily
        based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 24,000</NUMEX> accessioned bacterial
        artificial chromosome (BAC) clones covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> of the
        euchromatic portion of the genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The sequence of
        these clones is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 93%</NUMEX> complete to at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold coverage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Thirty percent of the genome is in
        finished form, including the entire sequence of chromosomes
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 and 22</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. These clones represent the most complete
        sequence information available, with overlapping clones
        positioned on a framework map using restriction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fingerprinting</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However, reduction to a single
        consensus sequence permits placement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and other
        chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in their proper positional context.
        Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> has distributed a working draft
        assembly of the entire genome that removes redundancies,
        orients sequence fragments and clearly indicates gaps
        arising from sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. The total assembled
        length is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.08 billion bp</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4%</NUMEX> smaller than estimates
        of genome size based on flow cytometry [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], presumably due
        to the exclusion of constitutive heterochromatic regions
        and centromeres. Major gaps (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50-200 kilobases</NUMEX> (kb))
        comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, whereas minor gaps (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX> or
        fewer bp) and low-quality calls comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>.
        Large-scale sequencing will continue until at least
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>. The current coverage is, however, sufficient for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> to enter a new phase, in which the
        entire sequence can be analyzed to identify genes,
        regulatory regions and other genomic elements and
        structures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linkage</ENAMEX> and genetic association studies can be
        immediately followed by investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> provides simplified descriptions of the
        genome, as disparate data sources such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> and
        numerous expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) and protein databases
        are unified. Similarly, formerly independent maps, based on
        cytogenetic banding patterns, meiotic crossovers and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">radiation hybrids</ENAMEX>, may be placed within the single
        consensus sequence.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Combine and conquer
          Public attention surrounding completion of the draft
          human sequence has fostered the impression that we are
          entering a 'post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, and that description of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their functions is straightforward. However,
          the challenges in genome annotation remain daunting [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>], and the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> can anticipate years of
          additional work and manual curation to produce a true
          gene map of high quality.
          Functional annotation of the genome is primarily
          hampered by the lack of a unified transcript index.
          Current transcript information still largely consists of
          anonymous and highly redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. The situation is
          further complicated by extensive splicing variation and
          elusive gene expression. To address these problems, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> relies initially on computational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX>, followed by confirmation with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. However, pure computational approaches
          can give differing results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], and may miss <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> or
          more of transcript-supported exons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Other gene
          identification approaches rely on selecting and grouping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> into putative gene indices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>], or consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. These approaches emphasize internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX> and result in limited <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that
          only partially overlap. The genome sequence serves as a
          powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arbiter</ENAMEX> of the quality of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence, and will
          enable consolidation of additional exons into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Thus, we adopt a more inclusive
          approach.
          Our approach is to combine the major public cDNA, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein databases</ENAMEX>, resolve redundancies, and place
          the resulting exonic sequences uniquely on the genome
          using the program Blast. We refer to these genomic
          segments (technically high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> pairs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>])
          as 'exons', although the alignment evidence awaits future
          biological confirmation. Splicing evidence was carefully
          maintained within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">genomic</TIMEX> clones, and across clones using
          the fingerprint map. For a given transcript, only the
          best match to genomic sequence (using splicing evidence,
          length and high sequence identity) was preserved,
          resulting in a unique location for each exonic unit
          within each database. We have successfully applied this
          approach to integrate UniGene consensus sequences into
          the human genome draft [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          To compile a truly unique exonic index, redundancies
          must also be resolved across transcript databases. We
          grouped the databases into ranked categories and ordered
          them within categories. Transcripts with known boundary
          information (using the untranslated region database
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR-DB</ENAMEX>)) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] or full-length cDNAs in the human
          transcript database (HTDB) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] were given precedence
          over other records. Consensus transcripts were given
          precedence over individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> because they provide
          greatly improved specificity, splicing evidence and
          transcript integrity. We assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UniGene</ENAMEX>-based human [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and rat consensus transcripts. Collectively,
          the databases represent almost all public information on
          known genes, transcripts and relevant homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. When aligned segments overlapped, only the
          segments from the highest-ranked categories were
          retained. After resolution of overlapping exons, a new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exonic</ENAMEX> index of contiguous spliced components was formed.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this new index inherited the rank of its
          highest-ranked exon, in order to facilitate subsequent
          identification of transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Our approach
          also ensures that known genes are represented only once
          in the final gene map.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1describes</ENAMEX> the identification of exonic sequence
          via the public databases. Not all human transcript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> could be placed on the genome, reflecting
          sequence gaps and the draft quality of the genomic
          clones. The percentage placement of known genes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-89%</NUMEX>)
          suggests that unsequenced regions will contribute
          substantial numbers of additional genes. The varying
          placement percentages among transcript databases reflect
          varying sequence quality and differing transcript
          lengths. Unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exons</ENAMEX> are those that have no overlap with
          those already placed by a higher-ranked database. Rodent
          transcripts provided a modest number of additional exons.
          Finally, additional placements were based on strong
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX> with supportive computer exon
          prediction. The percent placement was relatively low
          because all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were
          considered, with specificity assured by using
          appropriately stringent criteria and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> confirmed by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> gene prediction program.
          When all of the databases are considered, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">613,183</NUMEX>
          unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exons</ENAMEX> were placed, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">299,014</NUMEX> in complete
          open reading frames (ORFs) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55,860</NUMEX> in partial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          The total putative exonic lengths add to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>, or about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of the sequenced genome. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 50%</NUMEX> of our described
          exonic sequences are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). It is generally
          thought that the majority of exonic sequence is coding,
          suggesting that additional coding sequences remain to be
          discovered. This possible bias towards untranslated
          regions is to be expected, as current transcript
          information is largely derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' termini
          of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 30</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of the known genes or
          transcript indices contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, suggesting alternative splicing, internal
          genes or occasional artifacts (misassembly or genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contamination</ENAMEX>). The prevalence of alternative splicing
          remains unknown, but may occur frequently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Sandwiched</ENAMEX>' transcripts were merged with their flanking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indices</ENAMEX>, unless both the internal and the flanking
          sequences were from distinct known genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 150</ENAMEX>
          apparent internal genes). In addition, we observed a
          small number of apparently overlapping exons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 530</NUMEX>
          on opposite strands) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          We assessed three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction methods
          by comparing their predicted exons to the ones identified
          by transcripts and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Genscan, Grail and Fgene
          were used across the genomic clones to identify potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 70%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">299,014</NUMEX> exons
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> with either transcript or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> support were
          identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the programs, but a very
          large number (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">847,283</NUMEX>) of unconfirmed exons were also
          predicted. The large apparent false negative and positive
          rates imply that pure computational gene prediction is
          not yet a practical alternative to experimental
          evidence.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">units</ENAMEX>
          Our consolidated exonic index is of inherent
          biological interest, but it is desirable to further
          identify transcriptional boundaries to create a putative
          gene index. We used an approach designed to minimize
          fragmentation of exons and provide conservative gene
          counts (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The following
          criteria were used to identify gene boundaries: known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR-DB</ENAMEX>; full-length cDNAs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTDB</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> in partial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> as possible boundaries of coding
          regions; exons without continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> as additional UTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences; CpG</ENAMEX> islands; and gene boundaries predicted by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX>. Multiple in-frame exons in a continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> were
          always considered part of a single gene, an approach that
          tends to consolidate exons rather than create spurious
          additional genes. Additional consolidation resulted from
          extension of boundaries for multiple exons not residing
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> until the occurrence of genomic landmarks
          described above. The success of this approach depends
          largely on the extension and consolidation of overlapping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, and the integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> and other genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">landmarks</ENAMEX> provided by the draft sequences.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the number of genes added by each
          database to the cumulative sum. The total number of known
          genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR-DB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTDB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,673</NUMEX>. This compares
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,191</NUMEX> entries with at least partial functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UniGene</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX> build) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,863</NUMEX> entries
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX> Human <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Nomenclature</ENAMEX> database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 48%</NUMEX> of the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were based
          on consensus transcripts and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> based on individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,372</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transcriptional units</ENAMEX> were based
          on singleton transcripts without splicing evidence.
          Single-exon (intronless) genes occur with appreciable
          frequency in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one third</NUMEX>
          of the singletons in our gene index contain intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>,
          and are predominantly histones, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein receptors</ENAMEX>,
          olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, and cytokines or their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">homologs/paralogs.</ENAMEX> The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singletons</ENAMEX> do not have intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, and possibly
          represent pseudogenes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> contamination or other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX>. It is thought that most intronless genes
          originated from retrotranspositions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SINEs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEs</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. Thus, the total number of single-exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">under-represented</ENAMEX> in this study, because of the repeat
          masking process necessary prior to our analysis. This
          also applies to the tRNA, rRNA and other snRNAs in the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, which have been similarly masked. A total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,437</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were supported only by rodent transcript
          consensus, predominantly derived from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of
          early embryogenesis or tissues of the central nervous
          system. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,154</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were identified on the
          basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX>, with exons supported by at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene prediction program. Our approach yields an
          overall estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,982</NUMEX> transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66,610</NUMEX> supported by multiple transcripts or individual
          transcripts with splicing evidence. Therefore, the
          consolidation and integration of mainly the transcript
          information into the genomic consensus assures that our
          putative gene index is largely based on experimental
          evidence, rather than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction.
          It is important to note that pseudogenes are common in
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, and are thought to largely originate
          from gene duplication or retrotransposition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. The
          extent to which pseudogenes remain transcriptionally
          active is still largely unknown, however. It is also
          difficult to identify pseudogenes computationally.
          Although nonfunctional pseudogenes can have
          characteristic structural features, some functional genes
          can also exhibit such features [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
          We observed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands (defined as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 kb</NUMEX> upstream or within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>). For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,500</NUMEX> known genes with known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          boundaries, the value was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>. The average genomic size
          of each of our transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
          last identified exon (including only transcript or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based exons) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12</NUMEX> kb. The overall
          average gene length is likely to be significantly longer,
          but full-length cDNA information is not yet available for
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Comparison of gene counts
          Our count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX> transcriptional units on
          the genome is consistent with gene count estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>] that had held sway until recent widely varying
          estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 30, 31</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">680</NUMEX> assumed genes on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> and found matches to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of a selected set
          of assembled <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> contigs. The sampling approach assumes
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">680</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of all genes, resulting
          in an overall count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34,000</NUMEX>. An examination of
          evolutionarily conserved regions in known genes on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> compared to the fish 
          Tetraodon nigroviridis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]
          results in an estimate of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, assuming a
          uniform rate of conserved regions per true gene. These
          approaches resulted in similar estimates when applied to
          larger sets of mRNAs or known genes, and are similar to
          the current <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ensembl</ENAMEX> as having
          Genscan computational support and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> confirmation. All
          of these estimates are carefully constructed and
          remarkably concordant, and we propose possible
          explanations for the difference from our results. The
          differences do not result entirely from the reliance on
          transcriptional evidence, as has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
          Our estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">854</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
          greater than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], but
          represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.4%</NUMEX> (rather than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) of our gene total.
          It was noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] that high gene expression on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> could result in low gene count estimates by
          biasing the reference sample. In addition, known genes
          may be more highly expressed than unknown genes, which
          presumably aided their initial identification and
          characterization. Our evaluation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence supports
          the existence of both forms of bias. We have found that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>'s original set of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> contigs
          (selected with less stringent criteria than those used to
          estimate gene counts) map to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>. An
          examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> transcripts (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX>) reveals
          that the known genes contain a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> entries,
          whereas anonymous transcripts contain a median of just
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> entries. This is not entirely explained by the
          greater length of the known gene-like transcripts (having
          been correctly assembled as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>). In dividing
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in the consensus by its length, we
          obtain a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX> entries per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base pair</ENAMEX> for known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> entries per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base pair</ENAMEX> for anonymous
          transcripts. On chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>, the median number of ESTs
          per anonymous transcript is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, which is significantly
          higher than that among other transcripts on the genome
          (geometric mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.76</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.11</NUMEX> for other chromosomes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank-sum
          test). The estimate based on conserved regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] is
          calibrated using known genes. This approach also
          introduces bias, as such genes appear more likely to
          belong to the evolutionary core proteome. Known genes
          comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of all of our transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, but
          comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> which are conserved with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rodents,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          Caenorhabditis elegans. A recent
          high gene estimate based on transcript evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>],
          again using chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>, appears to result from less
          stringent alignment criteria, resulting in many putative
          genes.
          As genomic annotation proceeds, the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> will become clearer. Our approach
          seems to rule out artifactual or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> contamination as
          the predominant explanation for transcriptional units
          with unknown function or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX> has
          recently listed a count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,160</NUMEX> 'confirmed' exons,
          whereas we report <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">299,014</NUMEX> in complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> and many more
          in untranslated regions, suggesting that our approach
          identifies considerable additional transcription. We
          point out that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 58%</NUMEX> of known genes exhibit protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and, for example, a large proportion
          of transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> have not been functionally
          classified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. We therefore
          propose that most of the unclassified transcriptional
          units are in fact coding - the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homology
          may reflect difficulty in studying these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, or
          rapid gene evolution, and some portion is likely to
          function at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Gene map
          The placement of transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is not without
          error, as most genomic clones are unfinished and the
          restriction fingerprint map can be subject to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misassembly</ENAMEX>. To resolve placement errors, we used a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relational</ENAMEX> database to integrate information from several
          independent maps, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genemap</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'99</ENAMEX>, assembled genomic
          contigs, and fingerprint, radiation hybrid and
          cytogenetic maps (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Placement
          required a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> concordant criteria.
          Together, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,982</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transcriptional units</ENAMEX> were
          placed on the genome, providing an initial glimpse of a
          complete gene map. The mapand associated functional
          annotationare available as additional data files.
        
        
          Functional annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrEMBL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Information Resource</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protein Families database</ENAMEX>) were used to
          annotate our unified gene index, because functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keywords</ENAMEX> in these databases are standardized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We used the classification schema developed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Gene Ontology Consortium</ENAMEX> to assign each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keyword</ENAMEX> to an appropriate ontological description ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]
          and see additional data files for keyword assignments).
          When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was identified
          within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, clear functional roles and
          biological processes were given priority over other
          keyword designations. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based annotation
          was performed for HINT consensus transcripts. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> resulted in a greater number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 23,000</NUMEX>) than HINT transcripts (around
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX>) because of the increased length of exonic
          sequences from other transcript databases and the
          included genomic sequence. It is also important to note
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12,000</NUMEX> of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domain as evidenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> hits.
          Additional functional repertoire and biological
          complexity might be derived from shuffling, and other
          recombinant events of individual exons during genome
          evolution.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> also allows us to assess the protein
          composition of human versus other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. A BlastX
          result of 
          E < <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-20was</NUMEX> required in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-species <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-protein</ENAMEX> alignments to be considered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,892</NUMEX> human transcriptional units
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>) are homologous with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,792</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) were conserved across mammals (mouse
          or rat), 
          Drosophila, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,759</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>)
          were conserved across all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
          These values are very consistent with a recent
          comparative genomic survey [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Global tissue expression profiles
          During the assembly o <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], we retained the
          library source for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each EST</TIMEX>, via links provided by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> to the IMAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX>
          libraries comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene ESTs</ENAMEX> were derived from
          single tissues or embryonic stages, and we further
          standardized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library source</ENAMEX> annotation into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX>
          categories. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keywords</ENAMEX> and derived categories are available
          as additional data files. The most highly represented
          categories were various types of tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.0%</NUMEX> of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>), fetal tissue (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.7%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX>), infant
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.1%</NUMEX>), and testis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3%</NUMEX>). We reasoned that some genes
          might exhibit highly tissue-specific expression, such
          that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> comprising a transcript would be
          derived from the tissue. The identified genes are
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> of the involved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. Similar approaches have been used to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candidate genes</ENAMEX> for pathologies of the prostate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. We explore here the global nature of
          tissue/source specificity. The result was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,459</NUMEX> HINT
          transcripts with highly significant tissue-specificity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>). Many of these are known genes, and an examination
          of the most specific transcripts revealed clear
          relationships to the associated tissue. For example, a
          search for retina-specific genes revealed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          most significantly associated with retina include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          known genes, all related to retina function. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> are
          implicated in retina pathology: 
          GNAT1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> blindness), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHO</ENAMEX> (retinitis pigmentosa), and 
          GUCA1A (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cone dystrophy</ENAMEX>). Similar
          results were observed in numerous other tissues, although
          not as obviously related to pathology. The results appear
          especially striking for tissues with substantial <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          representation, including brain, lung, liver, kidney, and
          testis, suggesting that putative tissue involvement can
          be inferred for many anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. Where possible, the
          tissue expression profile has been incorporated into the
          annotation of our gene index. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.5%</NUMEX>)
          of the tissue-specific clusters were from embryonic
          tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (while such tissue contributed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX> of
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene ESTs</ENAMEX>). This striking result is consistent
          with the highly regulated and specific nature of
          embryonic development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. The embryo category is
          followed by brain (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.7%</NUMEX> brain-specific versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>) in number of tissue-specific clusters, kidney (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5%</NUMEX>
          versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX>), and testis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.1%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3%</NUMEX>). We also
          examined the locations of the tissue-specific transcripts
          on the genome, and found no evidence of regional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> (see description of regional functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
        
        
          A global view of the human genome
          In keeping with the long-standing clinical importance
          of cytogenetics, it is important to align Giemsa-staining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>) cytobands versus <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> (pale) bands (ISCN <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) to
          the assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Cytoband boundaries on genomic
          sequence have been depicted with apparent precision [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>] but in fact are largely unknown. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX>-fold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> coverage, the gap sizes in unfinished sequence
          are difficult to estimate precisely. Thus, it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferable</ENAMEX> to align the cytoband positions to the fixed
          assembly rather than the reverse. Such an
          'assembly-corrected' alignment was performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genes/ESTs</ENAMEX> that have been mapped cytogenetically and also
          placed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. This alignment is approximate, as
          the resolution of conventional staining techniques and
          fluorescence 
          in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) is
          limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3 Mb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Density of genomic features
          The resulting corrected ideograms and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> major
          genomic features are plotted across the genome in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exons</ENAMEX> (as determined above), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands,
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LINE1</ENAMEX> elements, and
          minisatellites are plotted as densities (proportion of
          bases belonging to feature) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> intervals. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>-corrected ideogram clearly differs from the
          standard ideogram - for example, in our representation ip
          is longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1q</TIMEX>. This may reflect more complete
          sequencing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX>, or perhaps differing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-packing
          densities on the two chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. Many of the
          chromosomes show a suggestive relationship between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytobands</ENAMEX> and exon density, consistent with the
          expectation that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> bands are relatively gene rich. A more
          striking result is the expected positive correlation
          among exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and minisatellites,
          which track each other closely on most chromosomes. Exon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> is relatively high on chromosomes known to be
          gene rich (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 and 19</TIMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], and low on
          chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,13</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX>
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands were found on the
          assembly using standard criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] (see Figure
          1legend), with a median length of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">336 bp.</ENAMEX> As sequencing
          gaps are filled, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> may increase. Considering
          the varying definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands (especially the
          minimum length of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CpG</ENAMEX>-rich region), this number is in
          close agreement with the estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,000</NUMEX> obtained by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antequera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] using methylation-sensitive
          restriction enzymes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CpG</ENAMEX> island density is also in
          agreement with a report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">karyotypes</ENAMEX> using CpG
          island probes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] with contrasting fluorescent signal
          in late-replicating regions. Extended regions of high CpG
          island density, such as the terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q21-q22</ENAMEX>,
          are apparent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH assay</ENAMEX>. Short spikes of CpG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX> (for example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p26 and 3p25</TIMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) do
          not obviously appear in the assay, perhaps because they
          are below the resolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> or are part of
          transcriptionally active regions.
          In contrast to exon and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CpG</ENAMEX> island density, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
          shows limited variation - in the range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-55%</NUMEX> for most 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> intervals. The overall GC content is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.1%</NUMEX>. This
          compares with estimates in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-41%</NUMEX> based on
          density gradient centrifugation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] and flow cytometry
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
          Consistent with previous reports [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>] 
          Alu repeats show an apparent
          positive correlation with exon, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> densities,
          while LINE1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densities</ENAMEX> do not show such correlation.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</NUMEX> 
          Alu repeats were identified, as
          expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. However, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">758,000</NUMEX> LINE1 repeats
          were identified - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> higher than estimates based on a
          sampling of sequenced regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Minisatellites of
          the hypervariable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-50</NUMEX> bp repeat size) are
          dispersed throughout the genome but, as expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>],
          show sharp spikes in subtelomeric regions of most
          chromosomes.
        
        
          Comparison of cytogenetic bands
          We next examined the overall correspondence between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytobands</ENAMEX> and exonic density and other genomic features.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4gives</ENAMEX> the average densities of features in the R
          bands versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> bands based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>-corrected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Genomic</TIMEX> intervals residing in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> bands were
          significantly richer in exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, 
          Alu repeats and minisatellites than
          those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> bands. The reverse is true for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LINE1</TIMEX> elements.
          These observations accord with predictions based on a
          variety of indirect methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>], or a selected set of
          genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>], but only now can be investigated directly
          using the sequence of the entire genome. The increased
          exonic density in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> bands was fairly modest
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX>), and may reflect attenuation due to
          alignment error. In addition, the analysis did not
          account for variation in staining intensity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> bands [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>]. The results across the chromosomes were fairly
          consistent, however, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> exonic density ratio
          exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chromosomes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 and 21</NUMEX>) and was below
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>). The increased density of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> bands was more striking (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>), whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content was only a few <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> higher (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42.2</NUMEX> versus
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.8%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> bands), again consistent with previous
          observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. The results for the cytobands are
          also reflected in pairwise correlations of the genomic
          features across <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> intervals. These correlations do not
          depend on the cytoband alignment, and most features were
          positively correlated. LINE1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> again differed from
          other features, showing a negative correlation with
          exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and 
          Alu repeats.
        
        
          Gene density
          We analyzed the exonic sequence for each chromosome as
          given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2ashows</NUMEX> the density of exonic
          sequence per chromosome. Chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 and 17</TIMEX> are the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richest</ENAMEX> (that is, densest) in exonic sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], by
          factors of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.04 and 1.62</NUMEX>, respectively, compared to the
          average for the genome. Chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,13</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> are
          exon-poor. A similar pattern emerges in the density of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> across the chromosomes, as shown in
          Figure 2b[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Reports based on integrated radiation
          hybrid (RH) maps of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56</TIMEX>] indicated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> were more gene-rich, but otherwise
          broadly agree with our results.
          An intriguing clinical observation follows from these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and the tissue-specific observations. It had been
          noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] that the aneuploidies that are compatible
          with survival until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">birth</TIMEX> (trisomies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,18 and 21</NUMEX>, as
          well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> aneuploidy) appeared to occur in
          relatively gene-poor chromosomes. Our data confirm these
          observations. However, the most obvious models for the
          deleterious effects of aneuploidy should instead depend
          on the total number of genes. In examining our HINT
          transcripts we have found that in fact the total number
          of embryo-specific transcripts is lowest on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We suggest that trisomy of other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> may exceed a limit of survivable dosage
          compensation during development.
        
        
          Comparisons to genetic and radiation hybrid
          maps
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,628</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Genethon</ENAMEX> markers from the Marshfield
          map were localized via e-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, along
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genebridge 4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">markers</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/ESTs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,688</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>
          G3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> appearing in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Genemap'99</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the
          positions of markers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chromosome 1</ENAMEX> assembly. The
          curves are nearly monotonically increasing, showing that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> is broadly correct, although localized
          orientation errors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outliers</ENAMEX> remain (see additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> files for plots for all chromosomes). These plots
          are immediately useful as they enable the placement of
          new markers on genetic maps without the need for mapping
          experiments. Some of the variation is likely to reflect
          estimation error in the published maps, and the curves
          are not completely monotonic for finished chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>. However, other regions are likely to reflect
          errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, as the genetic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> maps agree with
          each other but disagree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> (for example,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">130-148 Mb</ENAMEX> region is reversed on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          Mb region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xqter</ENAMEX> belongs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xpter</ENAMEX>; numerous other
          isolated reversals and extensive reversals appear on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). The genetic map shows a higher
          recombination rate per unit physical distance (that is,
          higher slope) at the telomeres, and a low male
          recombination rate (and thus sex-averaged rate) near the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>). Similar patterns hold
          for the entire genome. These observations agree with
          previous studies which had been limited to comparisons of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> maps [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>/female meiotic ratios [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>], or relatively few markers on well-sequenced
          chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. The plots offer an interesting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> on positional cloning efforts. For example,
          examination of the plots reveals that the hemochromatosis
          gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6p</TIMEX>, lies at the
          edge of a recombination 'cold spot' from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28-40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>. This
          fact complicated efforts to map the gene via linkage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. In contrast, the 
          NIDDM1 gene at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2qter</TIMEX> (a region with
          higher recombination rate) was initially mapped to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centimorgan</ENAMEX> (cM) region, which fortunately was discovered
          to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>].
          The radiation hybrid plots tend to be more linear,
          which is consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that radiation induces
          chromosomal breakpoints essentially uniformly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>].
          However, jumps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Genebridge 4</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GB4</NUMEX>) map occur at the
          centromere on most chromosomes. This may result from
          incomplete centromeric sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, so that a
          large centromeric gap might not appear as such.
          Alternatively, the jumps may reflect statistical
          difficulties in estimating break-point rates across the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX>. We note that no jump occurs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G3</TIMEX> map,
          apparently because the higher radiation intensity
          produces insufficient marker pairs in the rescued hybrids
          that span the centromere. Thus, the jump cannot be
          accurately estimated and was simply suppressed in the
          published map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GB4</NUMEX> jump is strikingly large on
          several chromosomes, and we propose that the jumps might
          reflect increased radiation sensitivity at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX>. This hypothesis is worth additional
          investigation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clusters</ENAMEX> and compartments
          The availability of the full assembly enables a
          comparison of the entire genome to itself for evidence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> arising from duplications or insertions. We
          emphasize that the genome is still in draft form, and a
          complete description of these features will be a large
          and ongoing scientific and computational task. We used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlastN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>] to identify intrachromosomal homology and to
          provide an initial look at the genomic landscape. Local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> is a feature common to all chromosomes, as
          evidenced by the near-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">diagonal</NUMEX> runs in dot-matrix plots
          in which the line of complete identity has been removed
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, and see additional data files for full-page
          plots for each chromosome). These runs vary across the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, and tend to be of high sequence identity,
          indicative of recent origin. More distant duplications
          also occur, and include large repetitive regions of high
          identity on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 and 17</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome shows
          strong internal sequence similarity, some of which arises
          from strikingly long duplications (from several of the
          order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb to a duplication of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> near the
          q-terminus of the euchromatic region). Near-duplicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> appear throughout the genome, producing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'plaid</ENAMEX>' appearance on many chromosomes. These sequences
          tend to have lower sequence similarity (blue in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), consistent with an ancient origin and accumulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
          As an example of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX>, we note that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60%</NUMEX> of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-finger (ZNF) families
          are mapped to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>, restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> large
          tandemly duplicated gene clusters spanning the
          chromosome. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one</NUMEX> type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZNF</ENAMEX> is found within
          each cluster, presumably as a result of sequence
          divergence. A majority of these ZNFs densely populate the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mb region</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZNFs</ENAMEX> are
          mapped to 15q21 (bZIP), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q11</TIMEX> (KRAB), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11q13</TIMEX> (C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> HC

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ).
          The largest functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is related to phosphoryl
          transfer and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinases</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, many of the
          biological functions involving phosphoryl transfer form
          large gene clusters as well. For example, the
          mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate 5-</ENAMEX>kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 55</NUMEX> other diverse protein
          kinases are distributed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> gene clusters on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about one third</NUMEX> of which have been
          previously described. Similar gene clusters are also
          found on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,19</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA repair genes form gene</ENAMEX> clusters on different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">postmeiotic segregation proteins</ENAMEX> (PMS)
          on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, glycosidases on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, MutS
          homologs on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MutT</ENAMEX> homologs on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>,
          MutL homologs on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rad1/Rec1/Rad7</ENAMEX> homologs on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, excision repair on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, and
          repair for single-strand nicks on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>.
          Additional regions of high and striking sequence
          similarity and the list of matching sequences with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX> are provided in the additional data
          files.
          Paralogous genes resulting from recent gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> might preserve the same functionality and
          regulatory apparatus as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX>. We used
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to test this hypothesis by
          comparing the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> profiles of spatially adjacent
          paralogous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> of the ZNF clusters (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-27</NUMEX>

          remaining clusters on the same chromosome (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
          sequence identity). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct tissue
          library profiles were scored for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> mapped ZNF
          paralogs, with the telomeric portion of the cluster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> expressed in germ cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">589/622 ESTs</ENAMEX>). The
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the cluster were primarily expressed
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryos 9-19 weeks of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">145/167 ESTs</ENAMEX>). The same
          phenomenon did not hold for the ZNF clusters, where
          sequence similarity is lower. We were motivated to find
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralogous genes</ENAMEX>, with their regulation
          similarly preserved. We mapped gene indices on duplicated
          genomic sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol dehydrogenases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) are tandemly duplicated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q21</TIMEX>, with their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> consistently being over-represented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embryonic</ENAMEX> and fetal cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Similar observations
          were obtained for other gene clusters, including amylases
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p21</TIMEX>, annexins on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q21</TIMEX>, homeobox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7p15</TIMEX> and

          major histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6p21</TIMEX>. Together, these
          observations strongly support the notion that much of the
          regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> of functionally related proteins
          originates from gene duplication.
        
        
          Clustering of ontological groups
          We also examined the locations of all transcriptional
          units that had been classified according to a gene
          ontology-derived schema (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods) for evidence of regional clustering of
          functionally related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We applied a test that
          corrected for regional gene density, and found
          substantial evidence for regional clustering among the
          transcripts belonging to the same category (see
          additional data files for location plotsfor the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ontological</ENAMEX> categories). Such clustering is pervasive -
          much of it is likely to have arisen from duplication in
          which functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> have been preserved.
          As an additional demonstration of the duplication
          phenomenon, we considered the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> motifs
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, with only the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfam</ENAMEX> match retained per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1,930</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,011</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> categories were
          represented). Matching successive runs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more
          (that occur <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times on the genome) appear in
          the additional data files. Many of the runs occur on the
          near-diagonal. Most involve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> identical Pfam
          categories in succession, or a double run of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          categories, again pointing to local duplication.
          We also examined the runs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or more</NUMEX> gene units in
          which the ontological classifications occur in the same
          order (or the reverse) in multiple locations on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. A dot-matrix plotacross the genome appears in the
          additional data files. The plot shows clear evidence of
          local duplication, while the distant matches (even across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosomes</ENAMEX>) are under investigation in the context of
          the complete sequence. We have noticed interesting
          associations among membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, ion channels,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transporters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding cassettes, and genes
          involving metabolism on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 5 and 7</TIMEX>. Proximity
          may be important for regulating functionally coupled
          genes, and intriguing observations of this phenomenon are
          well established in prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>] and
          recently reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>]. We are investigating
          the possibility that at least some of the
          positional-functional coupling may be due to regulated
          mechanisms other than gene duplication.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is a capacious resource that will
        support years of intensive investigation. The quality of
        the draft sequence has now reached the point that genetic
        maps can truly be integrated into the genome. Analysis at
        the sequence level shows pervasive local and distant
        duplication, much of which preserves function. We have
        found evidence for a large number of transcriptional units
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX>) and performed initial annotation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>. The effective study of transcription and
        protein function requires the compilation of all available
        evidence of transcription and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homology</ENAMEX>.
        Since the initial submission of this manuscript, two
        reports have appeared [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67, 68</TIMEX>] in which the human genome
        is analyzed and described. The raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic sequence</ENAMEX> used
        for the present study was generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> Genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> (HGC), and is principally the same as that used
        in their report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. In our effort, we have benefited
        from early-release and open data policies adopted by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consortium</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reports offer insights into varying
        aspects of the genome. In our report we have emphasized the
        compilation of all available transcriptional evidence, and
        have made observations of functional-positional clustering
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and global tissue specificity that will provide
        the basis for in-depth investigation.
        The other reports have arrived at estimates of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the genome, and the ensuing
        attention leaves the unfortunate impression that genomic
        analysis consists primarily of gene counting. While our
        estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX> transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> clearly
        differs from these estimates, it is useful to consider that
        there is much independent agreement in the reports. We have
        placed around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> known genes in the genome, and
        described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,000</NUMEX> that have substantial homology to the
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein databases</ENAMEX>. These figures are very comparable
        to the known and 'confirmed' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, respectively, placed on
        the sequence by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera Genomics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> and HGC
        reports rely on a combination of computational gene
        prediction and transcriptional evidence to identify genes,
        in a manner that may be highly conservative. Our approach
        to identifying genes and exons is more heavily
        transcript-based, with the presumption that pure
        computational gene prediction may still have substantial
        false-negative rates. In applying this approach, we find
        experimental evidence for many novel exons with clear
        splicing evidence, on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice as many as</NUMEX>
        described in the other reports. This fact largely explains
        our greater number of transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, as our mean
        number of exons per transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">613,183/759,822</TIMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.07</NUMEX>) is very comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGC</ENAMEX> reports.
        We hold that the reliance on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio approaches presents
        difficulties, as known genes may be more highly expressed
        and may present a biased sample for calibration. Another
        difference in the approaches is that we have used
        pre-assembled consensus transcripts whenever possible in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> to the genome. The use of such consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> is likely to improve alignment, increase splicing
        evidence, and has been shown to improve the detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. We propose that the remaining
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,000</NUMEX> units we have identified will represent a
        useful resource for additional investigation as genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> proceeds. A comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> approaches
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will</ENAMEX> surely yield new insights.

          Exon identification
          The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 June 2000</TIMEX> version of the repeat-masked draft
          sequences was downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ensembl Genome Server</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>] and blasted against cDNA and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> by
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blast</ENAMEX> program compiled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> toolkit
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.1</NUMEX>) on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-node <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGI Linux/Intel Cluster</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 550

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">node</ENAMEX>. The following databases were used: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human UTR</ENAMEX>-DB

          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.4</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>]. Gene prediction programs used are described
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rat Indices of Non-</ENAMEX>redundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transcripts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RINT</ENAMEX>) were derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rat UniGene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>] using the same approach that we have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UniGene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Briefly, chimeric
          sequences were removed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> transcripts were
          assembled into sequence contigs, and links to progenitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records retained</ENAMEX>.
          The genome-wide hit expectation value was set at 
          E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -25</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlastN</ENAMEX>) or 
          E < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -15</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlastX</ENAMEX>) to filter out
          nonspecific high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> pairs (HSPs). Default
          parameters of Blast were used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blast</ENAMEX> report was
          parsed into field-specific tables using the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSPcrunch Version 2.3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>]. The resulting table was
          processed using a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> retaining
          only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> that were spliced from the same transcripts
          on the same genomic contig. The same process was then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> on the genomic sequences. Spliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> from the same transcripts were retained, followed by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">singleton HSPs</ENAMEX> that were both longer and higher in
          sequence identity over their overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>,
          resulting in a unique placement for each cDNA segment on
          the genomic sequence.
        
        
          Prediction of transcriptional units
          A set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts was used to implement the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> described below. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic</ENAMEX> clones were ordered
          and oriented using the fingerprint map and draft
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. Within unfinished clones, sequence contigs were
          further ordered and oriented according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX>'s
          assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX>]. This mapping produced the positional
          context necessary for consolidating fragmented exon
          units. Where necessary, small sequencing gaps (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 bp</ENAMEX> or
          fewer) were ignored and genomic clones were considered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> except where a large gap was indicated in the
          draft assembly (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 50 kb</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were determined using
          the program getorf [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX>]. The exon index is an integrated
          table generated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sybase relational database</ENAMEX>,
          consisting of chromosome number, fingerprinted contig
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPC</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPC</ENAMEX> contig order, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contig ID</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig
          order, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig orientation, starting position of exon
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig, end position of exon on BAC contig, exon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, transcript orientation (available from
          GenBank, IMAGE, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene, HINT</ENAMEX> and dbEST), evidence
          (transcript, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, gene prediction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX>),
          database name (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), feature (poly(A) signal, CpG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> boundary), starting position on exon (or
          feature), end position on exon (or feature), score
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlastN, BlastX</ENAMEX>). The index was first ordered and
          oriented for the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contigs according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX> or UCSC [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX>] maps. The resulting contigs were
          then ordered and oriented according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPC</ENAMEX> order and
          orientation information in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSC</ENAMEX> genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>,
          resulting in a numeric sorting order for all the
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX>. In addition, large gap information
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 50 kb</NUMEX>) available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was
          incorporated into the same index, where no overlapping
          information was available between presumably adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>.
          The consolidation algorithm follows a hierarchy in
          which unit boundaries are respected for the
          highest-ranking feature. The features in descending
          ranking were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> based on known UTR indices; exons
          containing no ORFs or incomplete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>; boundaries of
          known full-length cDNAs (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HTDB</ENAMEX>-based indices); <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          orientation information (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' origin from the
          original IMAGE, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UniGene/HINT</ENAMEX>, and dbEST databases); and
          Genscan-predicted poly(A) signals. When clear boundary
          indicators were not available, information from the
          transcript indices HINT (assembled from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] were used directly as secondary evidence for
          potential gene boundaries. The rationale is that each
          UniGene cluster has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> known gene, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> representing both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' termini of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> containing a poly(A) signal [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>]. Similar stringent criteria were used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> and
          Green's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> assemblies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Multiple exons not residing
          in intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were consolidated until the occurrence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> in a partial or complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>. Multiple in-frame
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> in a continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> were always considered part of
          a single gene. To prevent any overconsolidation as a
          result of lack of transitional exons (in partial or
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>) for adjacent genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands, large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 50 kb</NUMEX>) between exons and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> prediction
          were used as gene boundaries when higher-ranking boundary
          information was unavailable. In such instances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG</ENAMEX> index identity was respected. Although a variety of
          criteria were used for determining transcriptional unit
          boundaries, the vast majority of the consolidation was
          achieved on the basis of terminal information from gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indices</ENAMEX> and transition and continuation of open reading
          frames.
        
        
          Gene mapping
          A relational database was used to integrate multiple
          largely independent maps for the genomic clones, where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> had been placed. This integration thus
          results in a transcript map based on the order and
          position of genomic clones. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> contigs
          within each unfinished clone were oriented using the
          Ensembl contig map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX>]. The fingerprint (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>],
          version <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 June 2000</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GoldenPath</ENAMEX> assembly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versions</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June and 5 September 2000</TIMEX>), and radiation hybrid maps [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX>] were used to place genomic clones into their
          chromosomal context. As a substantial number of the
          clones in the working draft had not been physically typed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> or genetic markers, the program e-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">primers</ENAMEX> collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHdb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genethon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX>]
          were used under stringent criteria (mismatch = o, margin
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>, and word size = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Genetic mapping information was
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX>]. In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genemap'99</ENAMEX> for cDNA was integrated into the genomic
          clones harboring HINT consensus transcripts. For the HINT
          consensus with more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one mapped EST</TIMEX>, an averaged RH
          position was used. Cytogenetic bands were inherited from
          the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> database. Furthermore, we
          incorporated a weighted composite quality score for the
          following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> maps: Genemap'99 (the number of
          consistently mapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and their associated genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clones</ENAMEX>), e-PCR (the number of consistently mapped
          sequence-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (STSs) in a genomic clone), FPC
          (the supporting evidence in the original database), Blast
          (evidence of splicing). On the basis of such an
          integrated database schema, mapping information from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, clone, contigs, radiation hybrid and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytogenetic</ENAMEX> positions for a given transcript could be
          obtained through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SQL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Structured Query Language</ENAMEX>) join
          statement.
        
        
          Tissue-specific transcripts
          We noted the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> contributed by each
          tissue to compute an expected proportion. For each HINT
          consensus transcript, we identified the tissue/source
          contributing the most ESTs to the consensus. The expected
          binomial distribution for the fixed number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in the
          consensus was used to compute a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value, which was then
          Bonferroni-corrected for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> tissues × 67,000 HINT
          consensus transcripts.
        
        
          Cytoband alignment
          G bands are known to be relatively AT-rich, but the
          precise relationship between sequence and cytoband
          position is too poorly understood to be used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genes/ESTs</ENAMEX> with cytoband position appearing in
          UniGene were placed on the full genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Cytoband
          cutpoints were used to create a scatterplot with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoband</ENAMEX> forming the 
          x -coordinate, and assembly
          position as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -coordinate. Outliers were
          identified as points lying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.5</NUMEX> standard errors
          outside of prediction intervals from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-degree
          polynomial regression fit. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loess</ENAMEX> regression fit was
          used on the remaining points to estimate cytoband
          boundaries, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and q arms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fitted</ENAMEX> separately.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centromeres</ENAMEX> and heterochromatic regions were assumed not
          sequenced, on the basis of a review of current clone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frameworks</ENAMEX>. Primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for assignments of genes to
          heterochromatic regions were examined and in most cases
          deemed inconclusive. An exception is chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>, which
          has a considerable number of genes assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19q12</NUMEX> and
          finished sequence in the region. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scatterplots</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> fits for the entire genome are in the
          additional data files.
        
        
          Genomic feature correlations
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> intervals were combined to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>,
          but statistical tests were performed by computing ratios
          and correlations within each chromosome separately, in
          order to account for correlation of features within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          chromosome. These statistics were then compared across
          the chromosomes to an appropriate null value using single
          sample 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests. Some of the features were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skewed</ENAMEX>, and pairwise comparisons were performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> rank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX>. A Bonferroni
          multiple-comparison procedure was applied to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          unique correlations.
        
        
          Regional functional clustering
          Apparently significant clustering can arise from the
          fact that genes exhibit regional clustering. To correct
          for this, we considered the physical order of all mapped
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> and calculated the distances (in ranked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>) between transcripts belonging to the same
          ontological category. Under the null hypothesis, the
          transcripts in a category should be distributed uniformly
          among all mapped transcripts with ontological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>, and the successive distances are
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> truncated exponential. On this basis we
          compared the observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> percentile of successive
          distances to that under the null hypothesis to compute a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value. All tests were highly
          significant, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.0001</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          largest categories, and quantile-quantile plots with
          observed versus expected distributions showed striking
          evidence of clustering. These tests were confirmed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutation</ENAMEX> tests with empirical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> under the
          null hypothesis. As a conservative correction for the
          possibility that separate transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> might
          belong to the same gene, we considered successive
          distances for every other transcript. These tests were
          also significant, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          categories.
