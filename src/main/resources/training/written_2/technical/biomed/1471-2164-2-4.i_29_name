        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> studies of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcriptomes</ENAMEX> and genomes
        have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of single nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (SNPs), the most common type of human genetic
        variation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human SNPs</ENAMEX> are being assembled into
        extremely high-density genetic maps that are anticipated to
        considerably expand the remit of genetic analyses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Broad availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes will enhance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacogenomic</ENAMEX> and complex trait <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies.
        Furthermore, extremely dense SNP maps have the potential to
        make possible genome-wide association studies for complex
        traits that bypass shortcomings of current genetic linkage
        analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The emerging era of multiplexed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SNP</ENAMEX>-based genetic
        analysis has underscored a need for simple and accurate
        genotyping methods that can accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of loci
        with economy of cost and consumption of sample <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, current methods require pre-amplification of
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, typically by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polymerase Chain Reaction</ENAMEX> (PCR),
        followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping with an allele discrimination
        method, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cleavage</ENAMEX>, ligation, single base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> or hybridization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Current methods are
        limited either by expense, inaccuracy, consumption of
        sample <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, or lack of scalability.
        Recently a new method for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> detection from genomic DNA
        based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase-mediated single nucleotide
        discrimination and signal amplification by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Circle</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplification</ENAMEX> (RCA) has been described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . An
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide Open Circle Probe</ENAMEX> (OCP) anneals to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target SNP</ENAMEX> such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligated</ENAMEX> together forming a circle topologically linked to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base-pair</ENAMEX> match between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the OCP
        and the SNP allows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase to circularize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>. A
        mismatch between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNP</ENAMEX> prevents ligation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circularization</ENAMEX>. In this manner, single base selectivity is
        achieved not only by the specific hybridization of the OCP
        ends to target sequences adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, but also by
        the highly discriminative nick closure activity of the
        thermostable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase toward a perfectly matched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. Upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> circularization, an isothermal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponential RCA</ENAMEX> (ERCA) reaction involving an exonuclease
        (-) DNA polymerase with strand-displacement activity and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primers rapidly amplifies the signal by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-fold, allowing for direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping from small
        quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> target [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        We describe here a simple, scalable assay for SNP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> directly from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> that uses a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate format and fluorescent primers called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluorsâ„¢</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 12 16</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> different SNPs have
        been characterized, each for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, using this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> assay system. We also
        report that the ERCA allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotyping</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as few as âˆ</NUMEX>¼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
        copies of the target sequence.
      
      
        Results
        
          Experimental strategy
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> were designed for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> screened, one
          complementary to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible bases of a
          bi-allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> is complementary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>,
          it can be circularized by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The OCPs
          were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ¼ 90 nucleotides</NUMEX> in length, and are designed such
          that regions at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends annealed to
          contiguous segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>-containing target
          sequence. The OCP backbone sequence connecting the target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">complementary 5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' regions is unique for the two
          allele-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>-specific region of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-30 bp</NUMEX> in length, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          target-specific region is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-20</NUMEX> bp [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tm</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' target specific region is âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5Â°C</NUMEX> above the ligation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, while that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' target specific region
          is âˆ¼ 15Â°C below the ligation temperature. Allele
          specificity of circularization is dependent upon two
          factors: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) favorable hybridization of the matching OCP
          because of the correct base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> formed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and
          also because of base stacking between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          annealed ends, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) specificity of the ligase for
          correctly base paired ends.
          Upon ligation, the DNA circle creates an effective
          template for an exponential, or hyperbranching, RCA
          reaction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11</ENAMEX> ] . The region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> between the
          target-specific ends, which we have designated the OCP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backbone</ENAMEX>, provides a binding site for a complementary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P1</NUMEX>). In addition to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX>, a reverse primer (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P2</NUMEX>) is
          also present to achieve amplification with exponential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). P1 is an "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amplifluorâ„¢</ENAMEX>"-primer, with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' hairpin and loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a fluorophore and
          quencher at the base of the hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 12 16</NUMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two allele</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> have different backbone
          sequences complementary either to a FAM- or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TET</ENAMEX>- labeled
          P1 allowing discrimination of the polymorphic base. Both
          P1s have an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DABCYL</ENAMEX> quencher. Amplifluor primers
          are designed such that, at the ambient temperature of the
          assay, the fluorophore and the quencher are in close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proximity</ENAMEX>, preventing fluorescence. Incorporation of
          Amplifluor into a double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> product opens the
          hairpin separating the fluorophore and quencher,
          resulting in increased fluorescence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different
          allele-specific P2s are also used in the assay. They are
          partly target- and partly backbone-specific,
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>-specific region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-12</ENAMEX> nucleotides of the adjacent backbone
          sequence. The backbone-specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' region of the
          allele-specific P2s not only increases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tm</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> to that desired for the assay, but also confers
          OCP specificity. P2s have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> abasic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end to reduce primer-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dimer</ENAMEX> formation (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Analysis of allele discrimination during the OCP
          ligation step of the assay
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the genotyping assay involves SNP
          interrogation by ligation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> using the
          thermostable ligase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampligaseâ„¢</ENAMEX>, which is reported to
          have excellent discrimination between a matched and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mismatched 3</ENAMEX>' terminal nucleotide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In order to
          directly investigate the efficiency and specificity of
          the ligation step, allele discrimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> ligation
          was analyzed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>. The
          oligonucleotide target contained the sequence for the
          M1101K <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> gene, a disease-causing
          mutation. An electrophoretic mobility shift for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circularized OCP</ENAMEX> allowed quantification of ligation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX>. Use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM oligonucleotide
          target allowed sufficient signal for detection without
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> step that is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> target.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> of the OCP matching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> were ligated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> sec
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). For mismatched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> was ligated
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampligase</ENAMEX> to
          discriminate against a mismatch was measured by
          comparison of initial ligation rates. Allele
          Discrimination = (percent match <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/percent mismatch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation</ENAMEX>) (time 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mismatch /</ENAMEX>time 
          match ). Ligation of matched OCP
          occurred at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>-fold greater rate than for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatched OCP</ENAMEX>. Greater temperature and shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3</TIMEX>' OCP
          arm length both tended to give increased allele
          discrimination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> is greater than
          the reaction temperature and so the OCP tightly anneals
          to the target. However, the shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, having a T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> below the reaction temperature, is
          in equilibrium between the annealed and melted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. A
          component of the allele discrimination is apparently
          derived from differential hybridization of the matched
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mismatched 3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. Presumably, increasing reaction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> has the same effect as shortening the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' OCP
          arm.
        
        
          Analysis of the ERCA signal amplification step of
          the assay
          In reactions where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> matches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, an
          estimated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> OCPs are circularized by ligation
          depending on the amount of input DNA target. Detection of
          this small number of circles depends on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stage of the assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> is capable of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12</NUMEX>-fold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> amplification [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In order to investigate the
          efficiency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> step, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> was circularized by
          ligation on a synthetic oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, and
          gel-purified to remove any linear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. A known number of
          the purified circles were added to reactions allowing
          direct analysis of ERCA signal amplification. The circles
          were formed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP-1822T</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G1822A</ENAMEX> using an
          oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold serial
          dilution of the circles ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6to approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> was used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reactions. An Amplifluor
          primer was used to measure the kinetics of the reaction
          in a real-time instrument. The results confirmed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> is capable of detecting < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> molecules of
          circular template (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). The time at which
          fluorescent signal is first detected (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> ) is proportional to the number of
          starting templates over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> orders of magnitude
          tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b). This demonstrates the quantitative
          potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> and that it is capable of detecting and
          amplifying the small number of circles formed by ligation
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>
          The G1822A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13q32</NUMEX> was used for
          genotyping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Grimwade</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished). Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> was digested with the
          restriction endonuclease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and assayed in two
          different tubes, each containing one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> allele
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>. Reactions contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> pM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng
          of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, corresponding to a gene copy number
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> ligation was performed with
          Ampligase for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60Â°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 15Â°C</NUMEX> above
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tm</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OCP 3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, in order to maximize
          specificity of ligation. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> has
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tm</ENAMEX> above that of the ligation temperature, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' arm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizes</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> in a stable manner, and SNP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> is achieved via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
          The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">isothermal ERCA</TIMEX> reactions were performed at 60Â°C
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bst DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. The reactions contained the
          appropriate OCP-specific P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluor</ENAMEX> primer and the
          corresponding allele-specific P2 (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 uM each</TIMEX>). When the
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was homozygous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> allele (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, top
          panel) a fluorescent signal was detected only for the OCP
          with a matching C at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and the corresponding
          primer pair <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1inFAM and P2inC</TIMEX>. Similarly, when the
          reaction contained genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA homozygous</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) a fluorescence signal was
          detected only with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCP</ENAMEX> containing a matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and the corresponding primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P1ocTET</NUMEX> and
          P2ocT. Only background fluorescence was detected for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatched OCPs</ENAMEX>. As expected, when the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
          heterozygous, a fluorescence signal was observed with
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OCP</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer</ENAMEX> combinations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). When
          the reaction end-point products were analyzed on an
          agarose gel, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> product ladder was observed only for
          reactions where the OCP correctly matched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> base
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5b</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reactions produce a characteristic ladder
          of discrete bands because the product consists of double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stranded</ENAMEX>, tandemly linked multiples of the circle
          sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11</ENAMEX> ] . As expected, the ladder band spacing
          was consistent with the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Validation of the assay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> SNPs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          The accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping assay was
          demonstrated on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA samples</ENAMEX>,
          each containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNPs</ENAMEX> representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> possible
          types of single nucleotide substitutions were assayed
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table II</ENAMEX>). Results were compared to the known genotypes
          determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing of both strands by the single base
          extension method. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> gave correct genotypes an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93 %</NUMEX> of the time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table II</ENAMEX>). When mis-scored
          samples were repeated in triplicate the genotyping
          accuracy was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 99%</NUMEX> (data not shown). A scatter plot
          of the data for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G1822A</ENAMEX> shows the clear distinction
          between each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible genotypes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5c).
          The protocol uses a microtiter plate format providing a
          high throughput method of genotyping.
        
        
          Single-tube assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping using a low
          copy number of targets
          The above experiments involved a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tube assay with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP/P2</ENAMEX> combination per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ng genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was used
          per DNA sample to be investigated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the objectives
          for high-throughput screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> is the ability to
          accurately detect a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> from a small amount of genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Previously, it was shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>,
          equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ</NUMEX>¼ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> copies of the gene, was sufficient
          to detect a C/T polymorphism using the serial invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> amplification reaction (SISAR) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In order
          to investigate the sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> for detecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ</NUMEX>¼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> copies of
          the gene, was used as target for circle formation with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G1822A</ENAMEX>.
          The method was also simplified so that instead of one
          tube each for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two allele</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>, a single-tube
          for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> was used. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> systems could be
          combined in the same tube because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of
          P2 are complementary to the unique backbone region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P2</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> could only effectively prime
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the P2</TIMEX> for the other allele could only prime
          the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reaction temperature. The P1
          primer was the same for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> and detection and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> was achieved by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two allele</NUMEX>-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2s</ENAMEX> carrying either a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FAM or a TET</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorophore</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annealing</ENAMEX>/ ligation reaction therefore
          included both of the allele-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP-1822C</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP-1822T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reaction was performed
          in the presence of both of the allele-specific P2
          Amplifluor primers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2-1822C-TET and P2-1822T-FAM</ENAMEX>). This
          assay detected and differentiated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> possible
          genotypes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G1822A</TIMEX> SNP (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The background
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> observed was slightly higher than that obtained
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tube system, with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>/noise ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:1.</TIMEX> However, correct SNP
          genotyping was observed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> different human genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have demonstrated a solution-based, efficient,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX> and robust assay for genotyping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> directly
        from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> utilizing ligation of open circle
        probes and rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle amplification</ENAMEX>. The design of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> is fairly straightforward and the assay can be
        carried out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">denaturation /</ENAMEX>
        annealing / ligation reaction and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/2</NUMEX> h for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> reaction) in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format. Specificity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> to its target sequence is achieved by the
        complementarity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> to the target
        and the requirement of these ends to be adjacent for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation</ENAMEX>. Single nucleotide discrimination is achieved at
        the ligation step by the use of the thermostable DNA
        ligase, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ampligase</ENAMEX>, which has a high affinity for a
        perfectly matched substrate at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecule
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . We were able to enhance allele discrimination at
        the ligation step by designing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCP</ENAMEX> such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        complementary region is firmly hybridized to the target
        sequence whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is in equilibrium with its
        target at the ligation temperature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . This would
        result in increased specificity since the correctly matched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> will have a greater chance to act as substrate for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligase</ENAMEX>. It has been previously reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-T/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        G/T mismatches are not good substrates for single
        nucleotide discrimination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, we found that
        the G1822A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, which would result in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>'-T/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> mismatch,
        was efficient for allele discrimination. The ability of
        this assay to genotype any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> regardless of the base pair
        involved is an important advantage over assays based on
        primer extension such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
        Allele discrimination achieved at the ligation step
        results in small circular DNA molecules topologically
        linked to the target DNA strand. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> circles are
        amplified in the powerful homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reaction capable
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12</NUMEX>-fold signal amplification [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , similar to that
        achieved with PCR technology, the current gold standard in
        genetic analysis and quantitation. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> involves
        exponential target amplification, thereby increasing the
        risk of amplicon cross-contamination. Even though this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shortcoming</ENAMEX> can be overcome, it increases the cost and
        complexity of the assay, making it less attractive for
        high-throughput analysis. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> is a signal (circle)
        amplification method, it does not have the problems
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> is an isothermal
        reaction and the reaction endpoint can be used as the assay
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readout</ENAMEX>. Even though the present study was conducted on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">real-time ABI 7700 Sequence Detector</ENAMEX> instrument the
        strategy can be easily adapted for a simple fluorescence
        plate reader coupled to an adjustable heating block. These
        properties make it an ideal system for high-throughput
        analysis.
        The assay was tested for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 SNPS</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table II</ENAMEX>). Results were compared to
        the known genotypes that we determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> or single
        nucleotide sequencing reactions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> had an average
        genotyping accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were screened
        initially. When the mis-scored samples were repeated in
        triplicate, the genotyping accuracy jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 99%</NUMEX>. The
        majority of the mis-scoring involved a homozygous sample
        being called heterozygous, i.e., an amplification signal
        was observed with both sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OCP</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer</ENAMEX> combinations. A
        DNA sample homozygous for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele was never genotyped as
        homozygous for the other allele. This implied that there is
        a low frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis artifacts resulting in a
        fluorescence signal.
        Indeed when these reactions were analyzed on an agarose
        gel, the size of the characteristic ERCA DNA ladder was
        different from that obtained with amplification of the OCP
        (data not shown). We have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abasic residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> in order to reduce these artifacts.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> modifications that have been reported to
        reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer-dimer</ENAMEX> formation will be tested to improve the
        accuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping. In addition, reagents that have
        been shown to reduce primer-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dimer</ENAMEX> formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> will be
        tested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reaction.
        Background signal is sometimes related to the amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCP</ENAMEX> used in the assay. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, the optimal OCP
        concentration needs to be determined before screening.
        Excess OCP concentrations result in an increase in
        non-specific fluorescence signal, therefore lowering the
        accuracy rate of genotyping. Potentially, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">un-ligated</NUMEX> OCP
        can act as template or primer giving rise to a low level of
        non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and subsequent fluorescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. We are currently developing a modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> design
        to overcome the need for concentration optimization. In
        this design, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> forms a stable
        hairpin-loop structure and opens up only to anneal to it
        target sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. Alsmadi</ENAMEX>, unpublished). As with
        molecular beacons, this may also improve target specificity
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Any unused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> is self primed and extended to
        form an inert double stranded molecule, thus eliminating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> as a source for non-specific amplification. Initial
        experiments with this design have been encouraging.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have described a solution-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping assay
        that is simple, sensitive and robust and can be easily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formatted</ENAMEX> to high-throughput analysis of single nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> and mutation detection directly from human
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> genotyping assay uses a simple,
        homogeneous, fluorescence readout and can be carried out on
        inexpensive instruments already available in many academic
        and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
