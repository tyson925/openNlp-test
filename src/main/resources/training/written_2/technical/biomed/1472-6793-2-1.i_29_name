        The iron status of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> may play an important
        role in cardiovascular health, with either an excess of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX> (mainly the storage form ferritin) or iron deficiency
        leading to significant problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] has
        proposed that excess iron (i.e., any iron in the ferritin
        form) leads to formation of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> that can worsen
        ischemic myocardial injury and contribute to atherogenesis.
        This hypothesis has considerable experimental [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] support. However, the "iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>" has not been universally accepted [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , and
        considerable debate on the role of iron overload on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> continues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Iron deficiency has also been shown to lead to
        ventricular hypertrophy in developing rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . While the mechanisms responsible for this
        hypertrophy have received little research attention,
        studies have documented an eccentric hypertrophic pattern [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] which has led <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to suspect a
        ventricular volume overload at end diastole as a primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophic</ENAMEX> stimulus. The hypothesized volume load, if it
        occurs, does not result from a change in blood volume [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] . It has also been hypothesized that a chronic elevation
        in sympathetic nervous system activity is involved in iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypertrophy</ENAMEX>. Evidence to support this
        view includes the observations of increased levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> in plasma and urine, and decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> content in the iron deficient heart [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , after finding that reserpine
        administration prevented the development of this
        hypertrophy, even suggested that norepinephrine is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the pathology. While little published
        research has subsequently focused on iron deficiency
        hypertrophy, there have been numerous studies investigating
        the role of sympathetic neurotransmission with cardiac
        hypertrophy induced via various methods (coronary artery
        ligation, chronic pressure overload, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>). Most have demonstrated alterations in either plasma
        or heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> content, and a de-sensitization of
        the beta-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of the heart [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Recently, the alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor
        has been shown in vitro to be an important modulator of
        ventricular hypertrophy. However, even in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>
        models <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpressing alpha receptors</ENAMEX>, the beta-adrenergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> appears to play an important role in hypertrophy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and the transition to heart failure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        Regardless of which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are involved in the various
        forms of hypertrophy, the sympathetic nervous system does
        appear to play a role in most, if not all, forms of cardiac
        hypertrophy, and much remains to be done in this area [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Almost no attention has been paid to the peripheral
        vascular consequences of iron deficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . With iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>-carrying capacity of the blood
        must be offset in order for the animal to develop to full
        maturity. Therefore, the chronic sympathetic activation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">iron deficiency</ENAMEX> should result in increased
        cardiac output. In turn, flow through the major arterial
        network would be enhanced in an attempt to maintain near
        normal oxygen delivery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamiya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Togawa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] have found
        that increased flow stimulates remodeling of an artery to a
        larger diameter through an endothelial dependent mechanism.
        It has yet to be demonstrated whether iron deficiency will
        stimulate a similar arterial remodeling.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> is an integral component of the arterial wall,
        providing rigidity and support. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron</ENAMEX> is necessary in the
        synthesis of collagen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and collagen content has
        been shown to be reduced in iron deficient hearts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        If this is similarly true for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> in iron deficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, a significant increase in distensibility would
        result, altering the normal pressure-volume
        relationship.
        We investigated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hypotheses using anesthetized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. First, we hypothesized that in iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        intravenous norepinephrine would cause an altered
        cardiovascular response, either in heart rate or rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> pressure generation (contractility, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dpâ€¢dt -1</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we hypothesized that iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deficient arteries</ENAMEX> would
        be larger and more distensible than in iron replete
        controls. Finally, we hypothesized that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> injection
        of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol would
        significantly reduce the development of ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX>.
        Our results suggest that iron deficient, hypertrophic
        hearts display a hyper-sensitive inotropic, but not
        chronotropic, response to norepinephrine. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, abdominal
        aortas from iron deficient rats display not only increased
        diameters, but also significant increases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distensibility</ENAMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propanolol</ENAMEX> injections do not
        prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac
        hypertrophy, drawing into question the potential causal
        relationship between beta-adrenergic neurotransmission and
        this form of hypertrophy.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Body weight, heart weight, and hematocrit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Experiments 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          Rat growth rate is shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. There were no
          differences between any of the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>) until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 days</TIMEX>
          of age, after which, iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> are of less mass
          than controls (*, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1also</NUMEX> shows the
          final mean body mass of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Iron deficient and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> more than doubled their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body mass</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week to 1 month</TIMEX> on the respective diets
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(â€ </ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). The control rats also had a
          significantly greater mass than the iron deficient rats
          (p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0004</NUMEX>) in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> group (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0006</NUMEX>), but
          not at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1530</NUMEX>). The control rats in this
          study increased mass at a rate similar to that published
          for the ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> fed CD rat [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] , suggesting
          growth was inhibited by iron deficiency. It is likely
          that growth inhibition is attributable to metabolic
          causes arising from both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery and
          mitochondrial insufficiencies associated with iron
          deficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The growth data for both the control
          and iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are also similar to that
          reported for male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Wistar rats</ENAMEX> fed an iron and copper
          deficient diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , but the iron deficient rats at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days of age</TIMEX> were larger than reports of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 week</TIMEX> old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlan Sprague-Dawley</ENAMEX> rats fed an AIN-76 iron deficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diet</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          Heart mass increased significantly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month of the diets</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ </ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Diet
          group differences were not apparent at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8674</NUMEX>), but the hearts of iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were of
          greater mass at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0357</NUMEX>), indicating that
          the heart has undergone hypertrophy by this time. These
          differences remained significant after normalization of
          heart weight to body weight (data not shown). This time
          frame for development of hypertrophy is similar to
          previous findings with iron or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> deficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 40 43</NUMEX> ] .
          Mean hematocrit levels (figure 2bottom) of iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient animals</ENAMEX> were significantly less than controls
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> (*, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3102</NUMEX>), of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX>. Many studies have
          documented significant hematocrit decreases after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
          month of an iron deficient diet [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 40 43</NUMEX> ] .
          However, few of these report data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX>, though one
          published study indicated a small but significant
          difference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and we have observed a group
          difference after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> of iron deficiency in another
          study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mullendore, et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in progress). We
          speculate that the ability to create significant iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> in this short time is dependent upon the
          purity of the iron deficient diet as well as individual
          animal differences. Nonetheless, examination of several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points during the progression of iron deficiency can
          potentially provide important insights into the
          development of resulting physiological alterations.
        
        
          Experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>: Cardiodynamics
          In these experiments, an infusion of intravenous
          saline was used to ensure that the delivery method
          employed did not evoke a cardiovascular response. In all
          variables measured, which include heart rate and
          ventricular contractility (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), systolic and
          diastolic pressures (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), there were no differences
          between pre-infusion and peak responses to saline.
          Therefore, any differences seen with intravenous
          norepinephrine were attributable to the catecholamine and
          not the infusion per sÃ©. Prior to the infusion of saline,
          group differences were already apparent between iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deficient</ENAMEX> and control rats at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> in heart rate (*, p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0025</NUMEX>), systolic (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0041</NUMEX>) and diastolic
          pressure (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0020</NUMEX>), but not contractility (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.6373</NUMEX>). We believe these pressure changes are associated
          with vascular remodeling, as discussed below.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3also</NUMEX> shows heart rate and contractility
          immediately prior to, and at peak response to,
          intravenous norepinephrine infusions. Prior to
          norepinephrine infusion, there were no differences
          between iron deficient and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          duration in either heart rate or contractility (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). Heart rate was unchanged from pre-norepinephrine
          infusion to peak response (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3905</NUMEX>). The only
          difference in peak heart rate response to norepinephrine
          was the iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0272</NUMEX>),
          which showed a significant decrease. Contractility was
          significantly increased for both control (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0259</NUMEX>)
          and iron deficient (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0008</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from
          pre-infusion to peak response. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>,
          contractility for iron deficient rats increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43.71%</NUMEX>
          upon norepinephrine infusion, while the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10.0%</NUMEX>.
          Figure 3demonstrates a unique response pattern to the
          sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX>. For both control and iron deficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, the response to norepinephrine is to increase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractility</ENAMEX> in the absence of chronotropic increases.
          Cardiac output, therefore, would be expected to increase
          due to enhanced stroke volume, with an uncompromised
          filling time and a more powerful ventricular contraction.
          In fact, this pattern is even more exaggerated in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iron deficient animals</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX>. Heart rate in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was decreased, which allows the animal two
          potential advantages. First, ventricular filling time
          would be increased, potentially allowing for greater end
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> and stroke volumes. This would be expected
          chronically to result in a eccentric hypertrophic
          pattern, a condition that we and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17</NUMEX> ] have
          found in iron deficient rat hearts. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the decrease
          in heart rate in iron deficient hearts when
          norepinephrine was infused would allow for longer
          myocardial perfusion time, which would compensate for the
          decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
          impaired mitochondrial function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The iron
          deficient norepinephrine response compliments the finding
          of an increase in capillary lumenal volume in iron
          deficient hearts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , which should also allow for
          better myocardial perfusion during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diastole</TIMEX>.
          Norepinephrine infusion resulted in a dramatic
          enhancement of contractility (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43.71%</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient rats</ENAMEX> when compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> month control rats
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.0%</NUMEX>). By utilizing a hyper-sensitive response to
          sympathetic stimulation, coupled with an unchanged or
          lower heart rate, the iron deficient heart can
          potentially offset some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery
          deficiencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> without risking myocardial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX>. These appear to be positive adaptations, at
          least short term, in response to a serious nutritional
          challenge. Iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> is not
          unique in this regard, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin</ENAMEX> has recently documented
          enhanced contractility without increased heart rate in
          hyper-sympathetic transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
          there is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence which suggests that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> which has progressed to the point of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>, ultimately results in a decrease in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractility</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 29 30 32 33 44 45</NUMEX> ] . We have
          not yet investigated whether the iron deficient heart
          will similarly lose the augmented contractility response
          in time.
          It has been suggested in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> that changes
          in sympathetic nervous system responsiveness may begin as
          a positive adaptation, but ultimately results in
          pathologic failure of the myocardium. For example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engelhardt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , in a study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> genetically bred
          with an increase in beta-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor density,
          showed that increased contractility was an initial
          response, but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 weeks</TIMEX> contractility was reduced by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> and ejection fraction by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>. The genetically
          altered, hyper-adrenergic heart ultimately failed after
          initial enhancement of cardiac function.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mukherjee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinale</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , in a recent review,
          concluded that with hypertrophy comes a decrease in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac contractility</ENAMEX> as a result of changes to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-type Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> noted that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adaptation</ENAMEX>, while generally present in a failing
          hypertrophied myocardium, is not necessarily present in
          less serious cardiac hypertrophies. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ]
          found that in compensated hypertrophy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          beta-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is relatively normal, but in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, the beta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have both

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iaccarino</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] came to a similar conclusion regarding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> and adrenergic down-regulation.
          Figures 4shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic pressures before
          and after the norepinephrine infusion. There was a
          significant increase in systolic pressure for both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0020</NUMEX>) and the iron deficient (*, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from pre-infusion to peak response.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diastolic</ENAMEX> pressure similarly increased from pre-infusion
          to peak response for both control (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0040</NUMEX>) and
          iron deficient (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> when
          norepinephrine was infused. These observations are
          consistent with the vasoconstrictive effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX>. Also, increased heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contractility</ENAMEX> is
          expected to increase peak systolic pressure. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> pressure of iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was
          significantly lower than controls both before (*, p =

          infusion. This is consistent with the idea of vascular
          remodeling to a larger arterial diameter with iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> (discussed below), which could reduce the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afterload</ENAMEX> against which the heart must work to eject
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experiment 2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative aortas</ENAMEX> from control and iron deficient
          rats after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> on the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX> are shown in
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, and mean aorta external diameter at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mmHg
          pressure is illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. There was a
          significant duration effect (â€ , p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), likely
          due to body growth. Overall, the diameter of aortas from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iron deficient rats</ENAMEX> was greater than from control rats
          (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0280</NUMEX>). The regulation of lumenal diameter in
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> is accomplished through the maintenance of
          shear stress along the arterial wall [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 50 51 52 53 54</NUMEX>
          ] . As blood flow through an artery increases, shear is
          also increased, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endothelium</ENAMEX> releases nitric oxide
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vasodilation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chronically</ENAMEX>, the arterial wall
          will remodel to a larger diameter to accommodate the
          increased flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . While we did not measure arterial
          flow through these iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deficient arteries</ENAMEX>, the enhanced
          inotropic compensation to iron deficiency, combined with
          the enlarged aortic diameter, leads us to suspect a flow
          dependent mechanism for remodeling. Future investigations
          will be necessary to confirm this assertion.
          Aortic distensibility, the increase in external
          diameter during stepwise internal pressure increases, is
          also shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. There is a significant group
          difference (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0101</NUMEX>) with the iron deficient aortas
          more compliant than the controls overall. A decrease in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> production with iron deficiency could account
          for this enhanced distensibility. It has been reported
          that collagen production is reduced in iron deficient
          hearts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , but we are aware of no studies that have
          specifically examined alterations in collagen production
          in iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deficient arteries</ENAMEX>. Further research regarding
          this issue is warranted.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experiment 3</ENAMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7shows</NUMEX> the heart weight to body weight ratio
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> that received a daily intra-peritoneal injection
          of either the beta-blocker propanolol or saline for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. This ratio was significantly greater in rats fed
          the iron deficient diet than controls (*, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0002</NUMEX>).
          Clearly, iron deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> is not caused
          by chronic stimulation of beta-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
          the heart.
          Many studies have shown that chronic intravenous
          infusion of norepinephrine is sufficient to cause
          hypertrophy, and that various forms of hypertrophy are
          linked to a decrease in either beta-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor
          density or a decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic
          stimulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 48 49 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barth</ENAMEX>,
          for example, showed that norepinephrine infusion induced
          left ventricular hypertrophy that could be prevented by
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic-receptor blocker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . It has been
          suggested that ornithine decarboxylase is a link between
          beta-adrenoreceptors and stimulation of tissue growth
          factor, which results in hypertrophy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . However,
          recent studies have focused on alpha-adrenergic reception
          as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , although
          some question the role of the alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor
          as a hypertrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . To date, no
          published studies of which we are aware have examined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-adrenergic reception and the development of cardiac
          hypertrophy with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">iron deficiency</ENAMEX>.
          The literature surrounding norepinephrine and its role
          in the development of iron deficient hypertrophy
          documents the following facts: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) prolonged iron
          deficiency causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 23</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the pool of stored norepinephrine in the
          heart is decreased with iron deficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 21</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX> and urine concentrations of norepinephrine are
          increased with iron deficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 68</NUMEX> ] , and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of reserpine (which depletes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX>) prevents the development of iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deficient hypertrophy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , but not hypertrophy that
          results from aortic banding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This, combined with
          other studies that relate chronic adrenergic stimulation
          to hypertrophy, led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossi</ENAMEX> to the conclusion that iron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency hypertrophy</ENAMEX> was caused by chronic sympathetic
          stimulation. However, our finding that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> injection
          of the beta-blocker propanolol does not prevent the
          development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy
          suggests that beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation may
          not be a causal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the development of hypertrophy.
          Future investigation is warranted into the potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-adrenergic role in this hypertrophy.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> responses associated with the development of iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. In our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiment, we tested the
        hypothesis that the iron deficient heart would display an
        altered response to norepinephrine, the sympathetic nervous
        system neurotransmitter. In contrast to what has been seen
        with most <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac disease</ENAMEX> states, we found that the iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficient heart</ENAMEX> is hyper-sensitive to norepinephrine. This
        suggests an adaptive compensation to the depletion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmitter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in the heart sympathetic nerve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>. Further, we found that contractility was
        enhanced, but heart rate was not. This would allow for the
        iron deficient animal to increase cardiac output through
        enhanced stroke volume, while maintaining the amount of
        time available for cardiomyocyte perfusion.
        Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment was designed to investigate
        whether vascular morphology would be altered with iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. Our results show an increase in abdominal aorta
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>, suggesting that a flow-dependent remodeling of
        the arterial wall occurred. Also, distensibility was
        significantly increased, which we suggest may be due to a
        reduction in arterial collagen. These morphological
        adjustments can be seen as a positive adaptation to
        simultaneously reduce afterload on the heart and improve
        blood flow to peripheral tissues.
        Our final experiment was a simple test to determine if
        the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol would prevent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX>. The failure of the beta-blocker to prevent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypertrophy</ENAMEX> suggests that, if the sympathetic nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is a causal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the development of this form of
        hypertrophy, the signaling mechanism is not mediated by the
        beta-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, much remains to be learned about this form
        of hypertrophy. Further experimentation may serve to
        elucidate not only the pathology of iron deficient cardiac
        hypertrophy, but other forms of this pathology as well.

            another into the left jugular vein.
            Following catheterization and closure of the
            incision, the carotid catheter was connected to a
            pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transducer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobe Model CDX III</ENAMEX>) and analog to

            of 1 V, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.D. Instruments, Inc.</ENAMEX>) was used to visualize
            the output. The pressure transducer system was
            calibrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury manometer</ENAMEX> at the beginning of
            each experiment, and was found to be linear and
            consistent throughout the range of pressures
            measured.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> microliters of saline solution was
            infused into the jugular vein catheter, and the
            cardiovascular response was recorded via the carotid

            the arterial trace recorded.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Treatment and Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
            Cardiovascular variables were analyzed immediately
            prior to infusion (pre-infusion) and at the maximal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pressor</ENAMEX> response (peak response), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> s after jugular
            infusion. Chart software was used to determine minimal
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">diastolic</NUMEX>) and maximal (systolic) pressures and heart
            rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contractility</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dPâ€¢dt -1</ENAMEX>) was measured as the
            average slope between each pair of data points within
            the systolic pulse. Pulse pressure was calculated as
            the difference between systolic and diastolic
            pressures.
            Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variance</ENAMEX> was performed using StatView

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> vs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX>) effects. Paired t-tests
            were employed to determine significant changes from
            pre-infusion to peak response. Dependent variables were
            heart rate, contractility, systolic pressure, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> pressure. Probabilities below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were
            accepted as significant for all statistical procedures
            throughout all experiments in this study.
          
        
        
          Experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>: remodeling of abdominal aorta
          
            Experimental Procedures
            After experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were decapitated. The
            abdominal aorta was carefully exposed, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            catheters were surgically implanted. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was
            inserted just caudal to the superior mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>,
            and the other just cranial to the inferior mesenteric
            artery. The superior catheter was used for stepwise
            saline infusions at a range of pressures from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - 120
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmHg</ENAMEX>. Exact pressures were measured via a pressure
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">transducer</ENAMEX> attached to the inferior catheter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>
            images of the abdominal aorta were taken at each

            dissecting microscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MZ6</ENAMEX>). The external
            diameter of the abdominal aorta was measured using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
            image software (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 1.62</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of</ENAMEX>

            was calibrated by using the digital image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> at
            the same magnification.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Treatment and Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>:
            Regression analysis was performed using aorta
            external diameter and inflation pressure as dependent

            was estimated as the slope of the regression line for
            each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. The external diameter of the
            abdominal aorta at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mmHg pressure was also estimated
            from the individual regression equations. Analysis of
            Variance was then performed on distensibility and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
