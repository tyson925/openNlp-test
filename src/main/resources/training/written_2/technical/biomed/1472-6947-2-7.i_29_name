        "Indeed, between the health care that we now have, and
        the health care we could have, lies not just a gap, but a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chasm</ENAMEX>." Crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality Chasm</ENAMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Health System</ENAMEX> for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stCentury</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> recently assessed the
        current state of affairs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> health care, they found it
        to be substantially lacking in key areas [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> identified a multitude of quality issues
        to be addressed: complex care is typically uncoordinated,
        information is often not available to those who need it
        when it is needed, and as a result <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> often do not
        get care they need, or alternatively do get care they do
        not need. A common theme underlying many of these quality
        issues has been under-investment in information technology
        in healthcare.
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Information technology in healthcare today
          Payment issues, rather than clinical needs, have
          driven most investment in IT in healthcare. Thus, billing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are generally much better than the clinical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, while the exact figure varies
          depending upon the survey, healthcare has invested at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> less of its gross revenues in information
          technology than other information-intensive industries
          like banking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, while banking has
          international standards for exchange of data, medicine
          does not. As a result, one can go to an automated teller
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> and withdraw money with a card, but
          going to a healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> in one of these locations
          with a serious medical issue would be a rather different
          experience.
          In other industries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have used excellent
          information technology as a competitive edge. For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> derived substantial benefit
          from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SABRE</ENAMEX> system, which made it easy to determine
          which flights were available, and to make reservations [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> with its tracking system
          has an enviably high level of reliability, which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> have perceived as extremely valuable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          .
          Few similar examples exist in healthcare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. While
          a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have what are perceived as
          "best-of-breed" information systems (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDS Hospital</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermountain Health Care</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, Wishard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Hospital</ENAMEX> and its affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Hospital</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partners HealthCare System</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] the
          reliability of these systems is nothing like that offered
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> outside of healthcare, for
          example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> all
          have had good financial performance, which has given them
          an edge in their local markets, though their goal has not
          been to spread. In addition, all their information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> were "home-grown," and disseminating them has
          proved difficult even to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> within their own
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. An exception has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Veteran</ENAMEX>'s
          Administration information system, which is an important
          model of integration. Information technology that results
          in better clinical quality has not played the same role
          it does in other industries for several reasons. One is
          that fee-for-service reimbursement did not reward
          efficiency. Another is that care delivery is so granular;
          much of it is delivered by not-for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
          and there are not just a few dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> as in other
          industries. Finally, in this unusual market, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> IT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> have had strong incentives to
          retain their customer base and avoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interoperability</ENAMEX>.
          Nonetheless, excellent IT and high-quality health care
          are closely linked. All of the healthcare organizations
          mentioned above are recognized as quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> due to
          excellent clinical outcomes, which have been achieved in
          part because of their information systems. Furthermore,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' information systems have several
          common threads: all provide near-immediate access to a
          wide array of information including nearly all clinical
          results; they are highly integrated; they provide
          clinical decision support; they have both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> and
          outpatient data with differing views for each; and they
          facilitate measurement.
          Building the "pyramid" of clinical information systems
          begins with a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> index and results retrieval.
          These building blocks are necessary before higher level
          applications are introduced. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> especially important
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">higher-level</ENAMEX> application is computerized physician order
          entry, in which providers write orders including
          prescriptions using computers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Computerization of
          ordering is important because most actions in health care
          follow an order; computerizing this process allows
          provision of real-time decision support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, for
          example implementation of guidelines and critical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Another application that is extremely important
          for delivering decision support is a program called an
          event monitor, which sits over a database and can provide
          notification when an important event is found (for
          example, a markedly elevated serum sodium level) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Even more challenging than computerizing ordering or
          building an event monitor, especially in the inpatient
          setting, is computerizing the medical record, especially
          capturing of notes in real time. Outpatient electronic
          medical records, in contrast, are relatively easier to
          implement and many examples of well-developed outpatient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> exist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Many benefits can be realized with
          the addition of each of these building blocks.
          Unfortunately, the industry norm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> clinical
          information systems includes only the base of the
          pyramid, if that. While most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> now do have both a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master patient</ENAMEX> index and results retrieval available for
          some tests for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had tests done at
          a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, views across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are
          rare, and many results are not incorporated. Building a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master patient</ENAMEX> index is challenging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> because
          of the absence of a unique identifier, and building and
          maintaining such an index is laborious. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> tests
          are performed at "outside" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, and because of
          this lack of integration such results are generally
          unavailable via the information system, as may be the
          case with unusual tests like electroencephalograms. While
          images of a variety of types including radiographs and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrocardiograms</ENAMEX> can now readily be displayed, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
          such images are typically not yet accessible to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>.
          More important, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital systems</ENAMEX> provide little
          or no clinical decision support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. Clinical
          decision support takes many forms - including passive
          display of information such as the last digoxin level and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> receiving digoxin; reminders - for
          example, that a mammogram is due; alerts - that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematocrit</ENAMEX> is falling rapidly or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has an
          allergy to the prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>; and guidelines -
          suggestions about orders in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a suspected
          myocardial infarction. Asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to deliver
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s complex care without such assistance is like
          asking a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> to fly with no instruments,
          given the vast array of information and knowledge that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> must handle. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason that such clinical
          decision support is infrequently delivered is that
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s subsystems - for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacy</ENAMEX> systems - do not have good interfaces and thus
          cannot readily communicate with each other. This lack of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> makes extracting important information and
          providing clinical decision support vastly more difficult
          than it needs to be [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
          Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> and outpatient systems in
          most healthcare systems are disconnected. Rarely can
          providers access outpatient medical information from the
          inpatient setting, or vice versa. Yet this information is
          absolutely pivotal to providing safe, efficient medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>; after all, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> are the same both
          inside and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Covering for another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient panel</ENAMEX> is vastly easier, safer and
          more efficient when their medical record - especially
          their problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and test results - can be
          instantly accessed. Transfers from acute care to
          long-term care or home-care are also problematic; often
          little information is transferred with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, outpatient care is much more fragmented than
          inpatient care, and would likely benefit even more from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computerization</ENAMEX> and communication of information than
          inpatient care.
          The lack of electronic information also limits quality
          reporting. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> report externally for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inpatients</ENAMEX> and outpatients using only claims data, as
          required by state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>; this is sometimes
          supplemented by chart review. These claims data lack
          clinical detail, so that reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pap</ENAMEX> smear rates do
          not take into account, for example, whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has
          had a hysterectomy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Internally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
          generally have information that is somewhat better,
          although this information is often sharply limited. For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> may assess the rates at which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (e.g. with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX>)
          are compliant with a few guidelines using chart
          review.
        
        
          How quality improvement is currently done
          Quality improvement in healthcare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is going on at
          many levels, but is generally poorly coordinated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX>, practices, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> all
          have programs intended to improve quality, but many of
          these programs overlap, and most are of marginal
          impact.
          While the science of quality improvement has grown
          dramatically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, many relatively ineffective
          approaches remain the workhorses of change, especially
          with regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> behavior. In particular,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> continues to be a mainstay, and is often
          carried out through lectures and newsletters. While this
          kind of passive education clearly plays some role,
          studies repeatedly demonstrate that its effect is modest
          and wanes rapidly when discontinued [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          The other main strategies for changing physician
          behavior include feedback, financial incentives,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rationing</ENAMEX> and penalties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Feedback - when given at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> - is typically aggregate and retrospective. Sometimes
          providers do get lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are out of
          compliance for a certain measure such as mammography, but
          these lists, while useful, are often inaccurate because
          they are based on claims data, and they cover only a tiny
          proportion of the issues that might be addressed.
          Financial incentives (e.g. capitation) and rationing
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">e.g. formularies</NUMEX>) clearly work, but are resented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, and can be hard to implement. Penalties
          create even more resentment, and are generally
          counterproductive.
          A more effective approach to changing physician
          behavior appears to be provision of real-time education
          and feedback while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are delivering care using
          clinical decision support. Such decision support improves
          decision-making and adherence to guidelines, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and
          is generally well-accepted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. It is most
          effective if delivered in concert with other behavior
          changing approaches, including education and
          retrospective feedback.
          Another highly effective approach for improving
          quality is to use industrial quality improvement
          techniques to address and retool specific processes,
          generally with multidisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Many of
          the processes within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> were never consciously
          designed. Judicious introduction of IT into many of these
          processes may be helpful.
        
        
          How quality is currently measured
          Today, most quality measurement within organizations
          is done using claims data, which lack clinical detail.
          Cases are aggregated using diagnosis-related groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX>) which are assigned post-hoc and may not accurately
          represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' clinical presentations. The outcomes
          most frequently assessed are mortality, length of stay,
          and charges (though increasingly costs are being measured
          as well). For most conditions, mortality is sufficiently
          low to be meaningless, and even for conditions with
          higher mortality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> often do not perform
          severity adjustment because of the difficulty of doing
          so, although increasingly good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> are becoming
          available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Length of stay can be decreased with
          enough focus and effort, and it is useful for cost
          reduction efforts, but is hardly a comprehensive quality
          measure.
          The variables most amenable to change are process
          measures, and many have been associated with improved
          long-term outcomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . Examples include
          door-to-needle time in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with suspected myocardial
          infarction, use of appropriate antibiotics in patients
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX>, and use of
          beta-blockers in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac ischemia</ENAMEX>. However,
          such process measures are difficult or impossible to
          extract from claims data, and costly chart review is
          typically needed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s system. As a result, most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> measure only a few of these at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time,
          because of the high cost of doing so. Moreover, for
          complications or adverse events, the standard is to rely
          on self-report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, which dramatically
          underestimates the frequency of these events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          Even among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> which are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, the current state of the art is to compare
          crude outcomes by condition from claims data, typically
          using resources such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX>
          Consortium database which includes information like
          length of stay and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          Such comparisons can be useful and result in
          identification of problems that can be addressed in an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> (for example if high mortality is identified
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX>), but these
          comparisons often aggregate disparate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          involve long lag times and lack clinical detail. In
          addition, the data may or may not be used by those
          actually delivering care.
          The recent interest in quality by payors and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> has resulted in a multitude of requests for
          quality data, which is overwhelming the limited resources
          of quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, especially as
          most call for process data which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> do not
          have at hand. Typically, healthcare has devoted a tiny
          fraction of its overall revenues to quality measurement
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, so that it is not surprising that there
          is little reserve.
        
        
          The evidence on quality and IT
          While increasing the use of IT in healthcare would
          result in benefits in several domains, the quality
          benefits will probably be some of the largest. In
          particular, this would improve the likelihood that
          processes will be successful, and would allow delivery of
          evidence-based decision support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, narrowing
          the gaps between evidence and practice.
          Many studies now show that computerization of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reminders</ENAMEX> and prevention guidelines improves adherence [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] . Reminders are especially important in the care of
          chronic conditions, which represent a large proportion of
          expenditures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> of these conditions
          requires tracking on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as well as
          excellent communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and patients
          regarding tracking and deviations; this will be made
          dramatically easier with IT.
          It will also be possible to improve safety in a
          variety of ways by increasing the use of IT, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          including introducing checks for problems, highlighting
          and communicating information about key abnormalities to
          providers so they receive a rapid response, and
          facilitating communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>.
          Communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> is also
          vitally important for safety, especially outside the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. In one study of outpatient adverse drug events,
          a large proportion of events could have been prevented or
          ameliorated with better communication between patients
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Compared to direct improvement, quality measurement is
          even more profoundly affected when information is stored
          electronically in electronic medical records, which are
          vastly richer than claims databases. It becomes possible
          to routinely find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with certain conditions, to
          ask questions about their recent laboratory values, and
          even to go through their notes to look for certain
          issues, like new problems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] .
          Finally, electronic records can be linked with public
          health surveillance. The events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>
          underscore the obvious need to improve these links [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          The financial case for IT and quality
          Overall, disappointingly few studies have examined the
          financial case for IT and quality, and doing so is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">methodologically</ENAMEX> challenging. But in other industries,
          investment was made because it made sense, and not
          because of randomized controlled trials.
          That being said, some data are available, although
          most relate to individual features or applications. For
          example, in a randomized controlled trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tierney et</ENAMEX> al.
          found that use of computerized physician order entry as
          compared to paper ordering resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.7%</NUMEX> lower
          charges (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1%</NUMEX> lower costs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          They believed that many of the benefits were seen because
          of delivery of computerized decision support at the time
          of ordering. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> found that implementation of
          computerized physician order entry resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>
          decrease in the serious medication error rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
          .
          In other non-clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, for example in the
          evaluation of electronic claims processing vs. manual
          processing, electronic processing will clearly have
          benefits, although relatively few data are available.
          Similarly, changes that result in greater efficiencies in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and specimen movement, as well as decreased work
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, will likely be highly beneficial, although the
          impact is difficult to measure.
          To assess the overall costs and benefits of an
          electronic medical record system, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kian</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] constructed
          a cost-benefit model for a hypothetical computer-based
          patient record system planned for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D. Anderson</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Center</ENAMEX>, and predicted that over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> period,
          the total costs would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$54.5 million</NUMEX> and the total
          benefits would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$129.7 million</NUMEX>. In the ambulatory
          setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Renner</ENAMEX> performed a study of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-physician
          ambulatory care medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and estimated a net present
          value for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMR</ENAMEX> system of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$279,670</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          Less direct evidence comes from a recent study
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that invest more in IT are
          more efficient [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The "most wired" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> had
          lower median expenses per discharge and greater
          productivity, as measured by full-time equivalent staff
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTE</ENAMEX>) per adjusted occupied bed, paid <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> per adjusted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discharge</ENAMEX>, and net patient revenue per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTE</ENAMEX>. However,
          differences in clinical outcomes were less clear: in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> and obstetrics, the "most wired"
          appeared to perform better, but were similar with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s average across the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> categories
          studied.
          Taken together, these data suggest that benefits can
          be demonstrated for specific applications and domains.
          However, many benefits will take time to be realized, and
          may accrue across a sufficiently broad range of areas
          that it will be hard to attribute them directly to
          changes in IT. Nonetheless, the aggregate data do suggest
          that better IT in healthcare, as in other industries, is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with greater efficiency and will be associated
          with higher quality as well.
        
        
          How recent changes including the internet affect
          the equation
          Several recent changes in information technology make
          rapid adoption of IT in healthcare especially attractive.
          One is that the cost of computer processing continues to
          decline. Another more profound change is the Internet,
          which essentially represents an inexpensive, broadly
          distributed platform that is ubiquitously available, even
          to small or geographically remote sites. This makes it
          possible to distribute information and knowledge at very
          low costs. This will affect the delivery of software and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for quality improvement, measurement, and research.
          For example, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large on-going study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
          have set up an approach in which identifiable data remain
          local due to privacy issues, but analyses are conducted
          centrally using deidentified data. Mirrored code is sent
          out to individual sites via the internet to minimize
          programming burden [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Finally, handheld devices
          will increasingly allow extension of desktop systems and
          will be used for many routine tasks such as capturing
          vital signs or administering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX> of quality improvement
          The high-quality health care information systems of
          the future will be vastly different from those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
          Longitudinal medical records will allow tracking of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' conditions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> in
          emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> will have detailed
          information at their fingertips. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinicians</ENAMEX> will document
          using structured tools that allow capture of patient
          symptoms, clinical findings, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>. The interdisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that manage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic conditions will be able to track
          their panels, and seamlessly exchange information. When
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are admitted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, they will be tracked
          from the instant they enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> until they
          leave. Because diagnoses will be entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX>,
          guidelines will be made available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. It will
          be easy to see where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> physically is at any time,
          where they are in their hospital course, what their
          treatment is, and whether guidelines are being followed.
          In one controlled trial simply posting the expected
          length of stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by condition resulted in a
          decreased length of stay, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] and this sort of thing
          will be done routinely in a variety of clinical
          situations. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> will have a
          better sense of what will occur and when, and this will
          result in higher satisfaction in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. When
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, their information will go
          with them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> responsible for post-hospital care.
          This system will include safety nets that are not present
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (so that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> does not arrive in clinic
          after a hospitalization, someone will go looking for
          them). Such nets are conspicuously absent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
          system.
          Much of the quality improvement that is done will
          revolve around refinement of specific processes, for
          example the process of getting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> through a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac catheterization</ENAMEX>, the medication process, or the
          process of dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic outpatients</ENAMEX> with poor
          glycemic control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX> will have not only the
          information they now have, but also detailed time data,
          information about how often processes fail or are
          delayed, and information about the outcomes of processes.
          They will also have better outcome data, which patients
          will provide.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> will be a much more active part of care. They
          will have much more information and control, and will
          interact with the healthcare system outside of visits
          much more than is usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will be
          the norm for chronic conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . All of this will
          be facilitated by IT: by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> websites that allow them
          to interact with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, by integrated networks
          within healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and by electronic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> that are the backbone for these functions. Thus,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> will enter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and blood pressure results
          on their website, receive suggestions regarding changes
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to improve their control, and be notified
          when they are overdue for preventive measures like eye or
          foot exams.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX> of quality measurement
          Quality measurement depends even more on use and
          integration of information technology than does quality
          improvement. In the future, it will become routine to
          measure quality on an on-going basis for many conditions
          and processes, and this measurement will take place as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> is provided and be integrated into the fabric of
          routine care. For example for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a myocardial
          infarction, the time they are first seen by emergency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>, the time they arrive at the emergency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, and the time they get to the catheterization
          laboratory will all be routinely logged. In addition, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when many key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> were given will be
          recorded, as will a number of key historical and physical
          findings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> will chart using tools
          that capture key data in structured format. This will
          facilitate both clinical care and research, so that, for
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cardiogenic shock can be rapidly
          identified and offered the opportunity to participate in
          controlled trials.
          Gathering these types of data will then dramatically
          facilitate process improvement, because it will be
          possible to address issues of variation, and to determine
          where delays and suboptimal outcomes are occurring.
          Risk-adjusted comparisons within and among institutions
          will be possible, which will allow overall improvement
          like that which has been achieved by a few isolated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern New England Cardiovascular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collaborative</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Barriers to change
          Perhaps the most difficult and problematic barrier to
          adoption of quality-related IT is that incentives for
          adopting such changes are lacking under the current
          reimbursement system. For example, under fee-for-service
          reimbursement there is no financial incentive for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to reduce adverse event rates. Even under
          prospective or capitated reimbursement, justifying
          investment in technology that will result in longer-term
          benefit may be hard for capital-strapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
          In contrast, technologies like magnetic resonance imaging
          scanners result in billable services and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have
          had no trouble making these investments.
          An additional issue with the current reimbursement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are not reimbursed for care that
          occurs outside encounters. Reform of the payment system
          to reward such care is badly needed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Also, support
          for collecting quality measurement data is necessary [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
          ] .
          Legal issues relating to this area also represent an
          important barrier. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stark</ENAMEX> laws make
          difficult some collaborations that would be beneficial,
          for example for an integrated delivery system to support
          implementation of electronic records in affiliated
          physician <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
          Another problem has been that information systems are
          highly complex, and provide uncertain return on
          investment. Because of the complexity of information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> will generally be best off
          developing a long-term relationship with one or a few
          vendors because of issues relating to connectivity.
          Because of this, the approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> in this domain
          has been to develop non-standard software, and to hold
          tightly to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> base. Making a transition from one
          vendor to another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is difficult because of the lack
          of standards.
          A further key issue is the wide array of healthcare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and the highly disparate nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          ranging from solo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and large integrated delivery systems. A
          solution that is effective in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> may not
          work in a much smaller <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. However, the internet should
          make it possible to deliver applications to a wide array
          of even geographically remote <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at low cost.
          A further barrier relates to privacy, confidentiality
          and security of health information. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s laws
          regarding these issues relate mainly to a paper world and
          are inadequate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Insurance</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Portability and Accessibility Act</ENAMEX> (HIPAA) begins to
          address some of the relevant issues, much remains to be
          done. Thus, while additional legislation is needed, it
          must be crafted in ways that make a revolution in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> information possible, and do not paralyze this
          revolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Specifically, it might become
          extremely difficult to do clinical research if new
          legislation is too restrictive; to address many issues,
          access to large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is critical. Technically, it
          is feasible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to ensure data safety, but much work is
          needed in this domain to develop laws and regulation that
          adequately balance privacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with the quality
          benefits that may be realized through use of health
          information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Policy Implications
          
            Standards
            An absolutely pivotal early step is establishment of
            national standards for key medical domains, including
            messaging, problems and conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
            radiology data, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> data, and pathology results
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . Until recently, adequate standards were not
            available, but that has rapidly changed, and a number
            of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> have taken the
            approach of establishing national standards, requiring
            that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> want to participate in delivery of
            information technology, they must adhere to these
            standards [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . This makes it possible for a market
            to continue to function, but under certain rules
            (analogous to setting up a rule for a discussion that
            everyone can talk as long as they speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Incentives
            Probably the most important step in achieving this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> is to establish incentives that make it
            attractive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to invest in information
            technology. While non-financial incentives will play
            some role (for example, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> special
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> if they implement certain processes, or can
            demonstrate they have excellent outcomes), financial
            incentives are likely to be more important for
            achieving major change. These could take the form of
            grants, tax credits or low-interest loans to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> making major investments in areas that
            have been demonstrated to improve care. Another option
            that has been suggested is differential payment scales
            depending on whether or not a technology such as
            computerized physician order entry is in use or not,
            which has been recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Patient</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Commission</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Examples of the type of
            financial incentives already in play that could provide
            good starts include legislation already under
            consideration by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medication Errors</ENAMEX>
            Reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 2001</ENAMEX>, introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snowe</ENAMEX>, has been introduced also in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Representatives Houghton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurman</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            ] . This proposal would provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $1 billion</NUMEX> of
            funding over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and skilled nursing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> to purchase information technology to
            improve medication safety. Another bill, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
            Information and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Quality Improvement Act of 2001</ENAMEX>, would
            provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$420 million</NUMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> develop and use
            information technology that can reduce the frequency of
            medical errors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . However such support would not
            be sufficiently broad-based, and would not substitute
            for development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health Information</ENAMEX>
            Infrastructure.
            Non-governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> - especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">payors</ENAMEX> and regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> - will also play
            extremely important roles in developing incentives and
            encouraging health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to improve
            quality and adopt safe practices. For example, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leapfrog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
            largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>, has identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> practice -
            computerized physician order entry, evidence-based
            hospital referral for high-risk procedures, and
            intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> physician staffing - that they
            believe will substantially improve safety. Although
            there are issues with each, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the
            areas they have targeted are actively considering
            adopting these practices, and this is likely a result
            of their activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Payors</ENAMEX> can adopt
            contracting and reimbursement strategies that reward
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that use IT more effectively - for
            example, submitting claims electronically. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can ask for quality measurement data that are
            meaningful, standardized and are more readily gathered
            electronically.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and confidentiality
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and confidentiality in information
            technology also represent an urgent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
            Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Portability and Accountability Act</ENAMEX> (HIPAA)
            begins to address this area, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] but has many
            problems which will need to be resolved, specifically
            concerning the nature of the boundaries regarding what
            is permissible and what is not; if interpreted broadly,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIPAA</ENAMEX> could make clinical research nearly impossible [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] . More legislation will be needed to strike an
            effective balance.
          
          
            Professional involvement
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacists</ENAMEX> and other types of
            health care providers all need to become more involved
            in advocating for and developing IT in healthcare and
            electronic medical records. This is an issue both at
            the local level (within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and among
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community practitioners</ENAMEX>) and for professional and
            organizational leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. While some groups
            such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Family Physicians</ENAMEX> have
            led in this area with their work on electronic medical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, more often such professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are behind
            in this area. To deal with this, more attention,
            including funding, will need to be directed at this
            area. To be effective, development and implementation
            of new information technologies must speak to the
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute-to-minute</TIMEX> needs of all types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Research
            Finally, while a great deal is known about what
            works regarding using IT to improve quality, much
            remains to be learned, especially regarding
            implementation and dissemination of systems. Key
            questions remaining include how best to deliver
            clinical decision support, how much adjustment of
            guidelines is needed for local implementation to be
            successful, how clinical information systems can best
            be implemented and disseminated - especially to small
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and community-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, how patients
            can best be involved more than they are, and the role
            of the Internet and other new technologies in this
            revolution.
          
        
      
      
        Summary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> today is inefficient,
        error-prone, and of variable quality. Information
        technology has the potential to substantially improve care
        by bringing decision support to the point of care, by
        providing vital links and closing "open loop" systems, and
        by allowing routine quality measurement to become reality.
        Achieving this potential will be challenging, and is far
        from guaranteed, but it is possible. If it is to occur,
        substantial investment will be needed to galvanize this
        change, probably in large part from the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
        with development of a national health information
        infrastructure representing the most important piece of the
        puzzle.
