        Genomics sequencing projects have rapidly generated
        tremendous amount of information. At the time of writing,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI UniGene</ENAMEX> database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/UniGenecontained 96,109 Homo</ENAMEX>
        sapiens clusters and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85,047</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mus</ENAMEX> musculus clusters.
        Predictions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and Celera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] suggest there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 26,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> human
        genes. Other recent studies suggest that these numbers may
        be an underestimation and that the human genome appears
        more complicated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Understanding the functions of
        such a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been an unprecedented
        challenge for functional genomics research. As the array of
        hope in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, gene expression array technology has
        quickly grown into a powerful tool to chart a gene atlas in
        various biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and under various conditions in
        a massively parallel manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Facing the
        challenge of annotating such a huge amount of genomic data,
        increasing array information density and improving analysis
        algorithms have become <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical research areas to
        ensure that gene expression profiling proceeds in an
        efficient and cost effective manner.
        Take an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> high-density oligonucleotide GeneChip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affymetrix</ENAMEX>.comfor example. Firstly, its human
        U95 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">series</ENAMEX> chip consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> chip types with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> coding
        clusters each, which makes it expensive to profile all the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in samples of interest. Can a gene chip take
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>? Comparing its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95</ENAMEX> chip and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Human 6800</ENAMEX> chip,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> has already increased chip information density
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> by reducing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per gene from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 16</TIMEX>. Since demand for higher information density has
        still not been met, it is of interest to study the probe
        number effect in detail. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, most optional research
        efforts focus on the downstream statistical and clustering
        analysis. However, on the upstream side, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are still dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> Â®software
        that comes with the measurement system to interpret raw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> algorithm implemented in its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite 4.0</ENAMEX> package (referred hereafter as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAS4</ENAMEX>)
        uses empirical rules derived from its internal research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to assign absolute calls for the significance of gene
        presence and assign fold change calls for the significance
        of expression variations. Such discrete categorizations are
        not the most appropriate language to describe quantities of
        continuous nature. Although it is well known that fold
        change numbers have defined behaviors of uncertainty, there
        are very few studies in this area. How does one assign
        statistical significance to expression analysis results?
        This work presents our preliminary research results for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions raised above.
        The Affymetrix gene chip layout used in this study
        contains the same number of perfect match (PM) probes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> (MM) probes. MAS4 uses differences between these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of probes for gene expression signals. The
        primary goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Match-Only Integral Distribution</ENAMEX> (MOID)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> is to discard mismatch information, which allows
        immediate doubling of the chip information density. In this
        study, the performance of both algorithms were benchmarked
        using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX> known fold change values derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> spiking
        experiments. Their false positive tendencies were assessed
        by no-change expression experiments. Computer simulations
        were used to study their noise tolerances, and to determine
        the minimum number of probes required for chip
        analysis.
        The idea of using PM-only information is based on the
        following observations: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAS4</ENAMEX> essentially discards the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> correspondence between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> (for
        details, see materials and methods on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> algorithm for
        absolute analysis) and still gives satisfactory
        interpretation, which suggests the contribution of MM
        probes might be approximated in a nonspecific manner
        overall. After we designed the first mismatch-free gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chip</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNF</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-HS1</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, the match-only expression
        analysis idea was proposed in other independent studies as
        well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> (submitted, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) adjusted their previous
        model-based analysis of oligonucleotide arrays [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] to
        PM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> calculations and found their results correlate well
        with that of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> information. In addition, the
        idea is endorsed by recent studies of Naef 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and Irizarry 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, in prepare)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://biosun01.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biostat</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jhsph</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/~ririzarr/papers/.</ENAMEX>
        One difficulty in comparing algorithms for gene
        expression analysis is the lack of "known" results. Here we
        overcome the problem by resorting to a spiking set and set
        of no-change experiments, where results are unambiguous.
        Model-based methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] generally require a reasonable
        numbers of training experiments of the same chip type,
        among which probes under study give significantly large
        signals in at least some experiments. Considering the fact
        that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> spiking experiments used were obtained by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        different chip types, and in addition some experiments are
        replicates under different concentrations and hybridization
        conditions, it is impractical to sufficiently train
        model-based algorithms in this study. We limit our study to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAS4</ENAMEX>, where training is not required.
        In the materials and methods section, we summarize
        Affymetrix chip technologies and describe the MOID
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> in detail. MAS4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> for both absolute
        expression analysis and comparison analysis are included
        afterwards. The benchmarks used for algorithm comparison
        were explained and comparison results were shown in the
        results session. Issues such as noise-tolerance of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> and further reduction of the probe set size are
        also included. We discuss generalization of the
        normalization algorithm, which may be of interest to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. Finally, the main differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> are summarized in a tabular form as conclusions.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiking</ENAMEX> experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiking</ENAMEX> experiments were done by adding to tissue
          samples a certain number of control genes with known
          concentrations. Since signal intensity is not exactly
          proportional to gene concentration across different probe
          sets, only the fold change values of each gene between
          comparisons are considered reliable and used to benchmark
          both algorithms. We are fortunate to have access to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments done previously in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNF</ENAMEX> for a
          hybridization protocol study, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX> independent known
          fold change numbers were derived. These experiments
          covered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hu35kSubA, Hu6800,</ENAMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mu11kSubA</TIMEX>. True experimental fold change values, 
          f 
          exp , range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX>. The raw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEL</ENAMEX> files) and experimental fold change values
          are available from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gnf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/publications/MOID</ENAMEX>.
          We applied both algorithms to these array data and the
          fold change numbers calculated were compared to known
          experimental values. Because of the way we defined the
          base and experiment, 
          f 
          exp are always no less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>. For
          MAS4, we used all the default parameters used by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite 4.0</ENAMEX> program in the calculation. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX>, we found using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> percentile for 
          both pct and 
          pct 
          
            f 
           (defined in materials and methods) gave optimal
          performance. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the comparison results (data
          available from <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gnf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/publications/MOID</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> algorithms give virtually similar performance.
          In the comparison, we defined relative error, 
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">err</ENAMEX> , as the following to benchmark
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX>,
          
          R 
          err1 = <|( 
          f 
          calc - 
          f

          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calc - 1</ENAMEX>)/ 
          f

          f 
          exp |> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> pairs ,
          and
          
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">err = <|</ENAMEX>( 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exp /</ENAMEX> 
          f 
          calc - 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calc /</ENAMEX> 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exp</ENAMEX> )|> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> pairs .
          Where 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exp</ENAMEX> and 
          f 
          calc are fold change values from
          experiment and calculation, respectively. 
          R 
          err1 and 
          R 
          err2 are defined symmetrically for
          relative errors of 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exp</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/</NUMEX> 
          f 
          exp , reflecting the fact that base
          and experiment can be defined arbitrarily, and the final 
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">err</ENAMEX> is defined as the average of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Each relative error number is an average over all
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">366</ENAMEX> data points.
          It seems the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> have very close
          performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. They all have greater error margins
          for calculating down-regulated fold changes (captured by 
          R 
          err2 ) than up-regulated ones
          (captured by 
          R 
          err1 ). MAS4 is more asymmetric than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> in this aspect.
        
        
          No-Change experiments
          Another set of experiments used for benchmarking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> is the comparison between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> prepared from the same tissue sample was
          hybridized twice under slightly different conditions.
          Those fold change numbers that deviate largely from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          are considered to be false positives. When we applied the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> experiments done with either human
          brain or human lung replicate samples (same mRNA,
          slightly different hybridization conditions), the results
          were all similar. Figure 2shows one of the typical
          comparison results. When only "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Present</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (defined by
          MAS4) were taken into account, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of fold change numbers
          were spread across <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.54</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.30</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX>.
          Clearly MOID assigns much less false positive fold
          changes than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> does in this comparison. If all the
          genes were counted, the spreads of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAS4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> results
          would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.89 and 0.29</NUMEX> for the same data sets. This test
          suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> is more robust than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Reduced Probe Set</ENAMEX> Simulation
          In the studies above, we demonstrated the feasibility
          of a match-only gene chip design based on the MOID
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. In order to further increase chip information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>, it is of common interest to understand how many
          probes are sufficient for expression analysis and push
          for the lower limit of the size of a probe set. This is
          done via computer simulations.
          In the simulation, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, a subset of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            r 
           probes were randomly chosen to be used in the
          calculation. Both the spiking and no-change calculations
          presented above were repeated with the selected subset,
          as we gradually reduced 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            r 
           . Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3and</TIMEX> figure 4show the results for the
          spiking calculation and no-change calculation,
          respectively. As the graph suggested, accuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> is
          essentially unaffected while reducing the number of
          probes down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>. This result enables us to almost
          triple the amount of clusters one can put on a gene chip
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> design. Combined with other new design ideas,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MOID</ENAMEX> lays the foundation for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> universal human
          chip that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX> UniGene clusters (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">release 116</TIMEX>).
          The results have recently been validated and led to many
          interesting discoveries, which provides indirect support
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> (to be submitted).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noise Tolerance</ENAMEX> of both Algorithms
          Computer simulations also enable us to study the
          behaviors of both algorithms under noise disturbance. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulations</ENAMEX>, a subset of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           probes were randomly chosen, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> values were
          multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to mimic the effect of serious noise
          effect. We repeated the calculations for both spiking
          experiments and no-change experiments, while gradually
          increasing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           . Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5and</TIMEX> figure 6show the results for spiking
          calculation and no-change calculation, respectively. As
          the graph suggested, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAS4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> can resist noise
          perturbation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2</NUMEX> cells out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>, the test favors
          MOID slightly.
        
        
          Probe-Specific Effect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> is based on the assumption that the background
          for probes is mainly non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific. The results
          indicate that this assumption is sound overall. However,
          it is clear that by better understanding probe-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX>, the analysis accuracy can be further improved.
          For instance, probe response factors might be derived by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accumulating</ENAMEX> and studying many experiments. If there are
          a sufficient number of experiments, where the target gene
          is significantly present, probe response factors may be
          retrieved by some statistical modeling. A recent study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] provides an important example in this direction.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Corimbia http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corimbia</ENAMEX>.comalso
          developed some proprietary methods to identify "good"
          probes and assign different weights to them to improve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis. Efforts can be made along similar lines
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm in the future. If probe response
          factors can be calculated, the "bad" but "stable" probes
          can be scaled, and the distribution may be expected to be
          closer to normal, therefore expression levels and their
          uncertainties can be calculated in a more statistically
          sound manner.
          Future studies for more accurate background
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">subtraction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may also improve the fold change
          distribution; therefore yield better statistics for fold
          change evaluation as well. The relative error in spiking
          experiments (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>) suggests that there is room for future
          improvement.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LogP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absolute Calls</ENAMEX>
          In the derivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LogP</ENAMEX> (see materials and methods,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), it is assumed that the statistics of any
          absent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> can be described by the general background
          curve 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. The</ENAMEX> 
          P value should not be literally
          interpreted as accurate probabilities, since it is only
          as good as the underlining assumption. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> should also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> in mind that a 
          P value is for the null hypothesis
          that the discrepancy between observables and generic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> is generated by noise, which is different from
          the likelihood of gene presence conditioned on the
          observed discrepancy. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LogP</ENAMEX> values more or less
          serve as a statistical indicator for the sorting of genes
          by their significance. The discrete absolute calls in
          MAS4 are determined in a completely different empirically
          manner. Although higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LogP</ENAMEX> values have a higher
          tendency of being assigned "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Absent</ENAMEX>" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX>, the exact
          correspondence between the two varies from experiment to
          experiment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LogP</ENAMEX> values above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.0</NUMEX> have a
          greater chance to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Absent" than "Present</ENAMEX>" by
          MAS4. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> should be aware not to over interpret this
          correspondence. One interesting observation we had in
          this study was that discrete calls by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> are not as
          stable as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LogP</ENAMEX> values. Sometimes a gene can be reassigned
          to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Present" from "Absent</ENAMEX>" by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> due to a small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbation</ENAMEX> in the underlying quantities without going
          through a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marginal</ENAMEX>" transitional stage.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curve Normalization</ENAMEX>
          It is clear by observing various experiments that the
          response of intensity to signal varies in different
          intensity regions. Occasionally, the normalization
          constant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            f 
           does not cover well for all intensity values. A more
          generalized normalization procedure should use a
          normalization curve instead of a constant factor. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> normalization algorithm can be easily modified to
          the following (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] for a similar approach):
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: include all genes in the normalization gene
          list.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: using the 
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           values for all the genes in the list, generate
          integral intensity distributions for both experiments. A
          normalization curve 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>(I) is constructed in such a way
          that the two integral distributions are identical after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX>.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: normalize the data sets using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX> obtained in the previous step;
          refine the gene list by further excluding those genes
          whose intensity values changed by more than a certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, > 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">< 1/</NUMEX> 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , between the two data sets.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: repeat Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and update 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>', until one of the following
          conditions is met:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the maximum number of iterations, 
          Itr 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , is reached;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX>(| 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX> ( 
          I )/ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX> '( 
          I ) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1|</NUMEX>) â‰¤ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> is a small predefined
          threshold;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) size of the normalization gene list drops below a
          predefined threshold, 
          Sz 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> .
          This algorithm offers a chance to correct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-linearity</ENAMEX> in the chip system to a certain extent. To
          demonstrate the algorithm, we applied the procedure to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measurements, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomics DNA</ENAMEX> sample of yeast
          s288c strain were hybridized onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix YG</ENAMEX>_S98
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment was a repeat of the first
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 50 days</TIMEX>, where some of hybridization and
          scanning parameters had been changed over the course. It
          is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8that</NUMEX> the curve normalization
          procedure out-performed constant normalization as
          expected.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm allows at least double or even triple the
        information density of current (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95</NUMEX> human chip) Affymetrix
        high-density oligo nucleotide arrays without compromising
        analysis accuracy. Table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2summarizes</TIMEX> feature comparisons
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX>.
        It should be noted that at the time of this study,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95</ENAMEX> chip uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per set. As
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetirx</ENAMEX> is planning on further reducing probe set size
        in their next design, the density improvement by using MOID
        may be less than the estimation given above.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Chip</ENAMEX>
          At the time of this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> synthesizes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides on a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">640 Ã— 640</ENAMEX> array with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          feature size using photolithographic fabrication
          techniques (some data used in this study were collected
          from some previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> arrays of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> cells
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 Î</NUMEX>¼m feature size). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (also called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>)
          in the array contains the same oligonucleotide sequences.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, typically a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-20</NUMEX> probes are
          designed for each targeting cluster (called a probe set,
          or sometimes a "gene".). An expression value will be
          derived per probe set as the result of analysis. Probes
          taken as fragments from a target sequence are called
          perfect matches (PM). Multiple matches per set serve as
          independent signal detectors and provide a possibility to
          capture statistical uncertainties. For each match, there
          is also a corresponding mismatch (MM) probe, whose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence</ENAMEX> differs from its match by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in the
          middle. Mismatches are meant to detect cross
          hybridization components of their corresponding matches,
          and are used by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific background
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtraction</ENAMEX>. There are also several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> control
          sets on each chip used for quality references, which were
          used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments to validate and refine
          hybridization protocols.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intensity Distribution</ENAMEX>
          In an ideal case, all the probes in a set should give
          similar signals and serve as replicate measurements. One
          common rule in probe design is to select probes with
          similar melting temperatures to minimize the variances
          among probes. The chemistry involved in a hybridization
          experiment is often too complicated to be predicted
          computationally at the current stage, therefore in
          reality probe intensity distribution for a set is usually
          fairly wide and has a long tail, which causes all kinds
          of difficulty for data analysis.
          One usual attraction in expression analysis is to
          assume a normal distribution for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> intensities. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> can be examined by the following calculation.
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, we applied a linear transformation to
          probe intensities, so that the mean and the standard
          deviation of the intensities in the set were normalized
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, respectively. Then all the resulting
          match intensities were used to generate an overall
          distribution. Our calculation shows the normal
          distribution assumption is not an appropriate one. When
          similar analysis was applied to mismatch intensities and
          mismatch-subtracted match intensities, the conclusion
          stays more or less the same.
          Despite the fact that the intensity distribution of a
          set is non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaussian</ENAMEX>, it is still crucial to find out the
          distribution function for match or mismatch intensities
          to generate meaningful statistics tests, if such
          distributions actually exist. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> tried several
          analytical functions on match and mismatch probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, the distributions seemed to
          be quite "bad", the tail portions even fade out slower
          than the extreme value distribution. It was found that
          distributions of mismatch signals also significantly
          depended on the sample and experimental conditions. One
          may reasonably suspect that cross hybridization,
          intensity saturation, overall sample concentration, chip
          production irregularities, and miscellaneous noise may
          all cause a change in the signal distribution. The study
          seems to suggest the distribution of cross hybridization
          should be taken from each experiment as a result of
          measurement instead of using an 
          a priori determined analytical
          expression. This guideline is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm: hypothesis and principles
          As mentioned in the intensity distribution analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> assumes cross hybridization behavior of probes is
          mainly non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific, and therefore all the match
          cells can share the same cross hybridization background.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> primarily aims at saving <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the chip space
          currently dedicated to mismatch cells in the Affymetrix
          design under this study. It was also discussed before
          that cross hybridization distributions should be taken
          from experimental data instead of from some analytical
          function. Based upon the general belief that there is
          always a significant amount of genes unexpressed in any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mRNA</ENAMEX> experiment, we will use the match cell signals from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> darkest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> in the current public
          Affymetrix arrays to prove the point that it is possible
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> not to use any mismatch signal. For the next
          generation gene chip designed based on MOID algorithm,
          some designated probes may be used as generic mismatches
          to collect non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific cross hybridization data.
          In fact, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNF</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-HS1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,460</NUMEX> probes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">476</NUMEX> viral genes
          are used for such a purpose.
          As discussed, the distributions of quantities in
          expression analysis are usually asymmetric and contain a
          long tail, regardless whether it is match intensity,
          mismatch intensity, or average intensity difference. For
          such abnormal distributions, concepts like mathematical
          average and standard deviation are not the most
          appropriate statistical terms to use. Pre-filtering the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, like what MAS4 does, certainly helps reshape the
          distribution, but by no means this can bring the
          distribution back to normal without throwing out a
          significant portion of measurements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm
          is specifically designed to avoid these problems by using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentile</ENAMEX> instead of mean and using confidence intervals
          instead of standard deviation in all possible cases.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm for significance of gene
          presence
          A non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific integral background distribution
          (representing noise, cross hybridization, and possible
          other factors), 
          B ( 
          I ), is derived from the
          intensities of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> darkest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (or from generic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> in the future). 
          I stands for intensity; 
          B satisfies boundary conditions: 
          B (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B (âˆž</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, the match signals are sorted and
          the integral distribution, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           ( 
          I ), is generated as well. Figure
          7is a schematic diagram.
          If the gene represented by a probe set is absent, the
          intensity data from matches are due to pure background
          contribution, therefore 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           is likely to be close to 
          B. We choose the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX>-Smirnov
          test to determine likelihood that the observed signal
          distribution, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , could be explained by 
          B. If we define 
          d 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k max</ENAMEX> as the maximum vertical
          distance between 
          B and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> statistics, the probability of
          observing discrepancies greater than 
          d 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k max</ENAMEX> is determined by a P
          value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
          
          where
          
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           is the effective number of data points in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX>
          statistics, which is the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> for gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> in our case. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> carries the meaning of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probability</ENAMEX>, therefore is a number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0 and 1</NUMEX>.
          Practically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Log</ENAMEX> 
          10 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> , a negative value, is used as
          our final representation. In this way, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> uses a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuous LogP</ENAMEX> criterion to replace MAS4 absolute calls.
          Those signal sets that can be easily explained by noise
          are assigned a LogP value closer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm for expression level
          calculation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> uses the horizontal distance between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           and 
          B to represent gene expression
          level (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Since the darkest probes may be more
          likely caused by their poor binding properties to the
          target gene, and the brightest probes may be more likely
          caused by serious cross hybridization issues, different
          parts of the integral distribution tend to have different
          qualities. Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm uses the
          horizontal distance measured at a certain percentile, 
          pct, instead of the whole curve.
          Based on the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments
          discussed later, it is empirically determined that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> is
          the optimal percentile for signal retrieval. We also
          tried to use the average of horizontal distances from
          several

          improvement. Therefore the expression level

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , related to gene concentration for gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, is defined as

          Instead of using the standard deviation, we take
          confidence intervals directly from the distribution curve
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , with the background subtracted. E.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
          confidence intervals can be represented by a lower bound
          ( 
          E 
          
            kl 
           ) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> percentile and an upper bound ( 
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ku</ENAMEX> 
           ) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> percentile of the distribution, i.e.,
          
          E 
          
            kl 
           <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> (

          and
          
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ku</ENAMEX>

          As one might expect, increment of the probe set size
          helps narrowing down the confidence intervals in a manner
          determined by the statistics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> distribution.
          However, this piece of information is unknown and we took
          an 
          ad hoc approach by modifying the
          boundaries formulae as the following:
          
          and
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm for normalization
          The most common way of understanding gene functions by
          expression profiling is to study the change of their
          expression levels in various disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and cellular
          environments. The observed expression level is a product
          of complicated protocols, and is subjected to various
          factors from sample preparation to final image scanning.
          Therefore, it is a common practice to normalize
          expression data drawn from multiple profiles before
          making any reliable interpretation.
          The normalization procedure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> aims at
          normalizing the average intensities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          (excluding the top and bottom <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>). To avoid possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> contamination, MOID takes similar approach by
          normalizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 90</NUMEX> percentiles.
          However, it is noticed that an ideal normalization factor
          should be derived from only those genes that do not
          change their expression levels between the two
          experiments. MAS software provides the possibility to use
          a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housekeeping genes</ENAMEX> for such purposes; however,
          it certainly requires careful downstream research to
          validate any such a list. Some common normalization
          criteria were summarized in a recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zien et</ENAMEX> al.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> uses a heuristic bootstrap method to
          identify an approximate list of unchanged genes between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sets:
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: include all genes as the normalization gene
          list.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: sort the 
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           values (already background subtracted) for all the
          genes in the list; the interesting portion of expression
          values (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 10% and 90%</NUMEX> in our case) is retrieved and
          average intensity is calculated for each experiment,
          respectively. The initial normalization factor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nf</ENAMEX> is calculated by the ratio of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> average intensities.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: normalize the data sets using 
          nf obtained in the previous step;
          refine the gene list by further excluding those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          whose intensity values changed by more than a certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, > 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">< 1/</NUMEX> 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , between the two data sets.
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: repeat Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and update 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nf</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nf'</ENAMEX>, until one of the following
          conditions is met:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the maximum number of iterations, 
          Itr 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , is reached;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) | 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nf/nf' - 1| â‰¤</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> is a small predefined
          threshold;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) size of the normalization gene list drops below a
          predefined threshold, 
          Sz 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> .
          In practice, a single iteration is usually sufficient
          for most comparisons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">User</ENAMEX> can adjust threshold
          parameters towards their preferred stringent levels. In
          this study we use 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, 
          Itr 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, 
          Sz 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm for comparison analysis
          Different probes within the same probe set generally
          respond very differently to mRNA sample fragments. We
          examined various <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> properties such as melting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, nucleotide base composition, possible
          sequence motifs, and potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in
          order to understand the cause of such diverse response
          properties. That study did not find any conclusive factor
          that explains observed probe signal distribution
          satisfactory. Although it seems rather difficult to
          pre-compute and predict probe responses, it is possible
          to derive some features afterwards for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> based on a
          significant amount of expression data where the target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> of interest is present [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Instead of using a
          modeling approach to explain various signal
          contributions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> uses a new approach to avoid the
          affect of diversities of probe response factors in
          calculating expression fold changes.
          Let us assume any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probes in a probe set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> of size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           always respond to their target gene concentration
          with factor 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , respectively. That is, if the gene
          is present at concentration 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hybridizations</TIMEX>, the two
          probes in average give signal intensities 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 in the first</TIMEX> experiment, 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 in the second</TIMEX> experiment. As in
          MAS4, fold change is calculated by the ratio between 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , where the result is essentially
          dominated by the probes with the largest response
          factors, and the statistics of the ratio becomes
          difficult to estimate. However, we observe that by taking
          the ratio of the two signals for each probe individually,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> essentially is looking at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           independent measurements of 
          c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /</ENAMEX> 
          c 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for that probe set. This opens a
          possibility for obtaining a distribution of fold change
          values.
          If one assumes most probes have a rather stable
          intrinsic response factor, 
          r, a fold change number can be
          calculated from each probe 
          i in the set independently, which
          hopefully removes the affect of the unknown response
          factors 
          r 
          
            i 
           . However, it seems the response factor of each
          probe has a non-negligible intrinsic spread as well; this
          may be further complicated by alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> and
          tissue-specific cross hybridization issues. In addition,
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ratio</ENAMEX> numbers calculated for a probe set are not
          normally distributed (it is well known that even the
          ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> normally distributed values is no longer
          normally distributed). The current background subtraction
          algorithm may not take fully into account response
          factor-unrelated signals, therefore could further
          increase the non-normal component. To overcome this
          difficulty, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> uses a percentile, 
          pct 
          
            f 
           , of the integral distribution formed by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           fold change numbers, 
          F 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           ( 
          f ), which satisfied the boundary
          conditions: 
          F (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F (âˆž</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Empirically, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> is used
          for 
          pct 
          
            f 
           as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiking</ENAMEX> experiments discussed
          later. The confidence intervals are also directly taken
          from relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">percentiles</ENAMEX> in the distribution
          corresponding to the lower bound and upper bound,
          respectively. The effect of the number 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           is taken into account in the same heuristic manner
          as we did previously for absolute analysis. The final
          formulae are:
          
        
        
          MAS4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algorithm for Absolute Analysis</ENAMEX>
          After a sample is hybridized to probes on a chip, the
          chip is scanned and fluorescent signals are collected and
          stored in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> DAT file. For cell 
          i, after filtering out boundary
          pixels,

            i 
           numbers of pixels are used to calculate an average

           and standard deviation Ïƒ

          where average is done over all background cells.
          MAS4 assumes that the cross hybridization component of
          a match is captured by its mismatch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX>, therefore
          the difference,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , is used to derive expression levels. MAS4 also
          uses a "<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">super-Olympic</ENAMEX> scoring" procedure to iteratively
          filter out outliers, defined as those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs with
          difference values <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times the standard
          deviation away from the mean. After filtering, the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , is used to represent the expression level of that
          particular gene.
          The significance of gene presence is determined by an

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">proprietary MAS4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX>, parts of which are described

          where the average is taken over all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs
          surviving the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">super-Olympic</ENAMEX> filtering process mentioned
          above. Based on this observation, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>

           , typically with an average correlation coefficient
          around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX>, are essentially lost during such averaging.
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> is successful in various applications despite
          the fact it averages out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific mismatch signals,
          we hypothesize that contributions of the mismatch probes
          are mainly probe-nonspecific, if the pairwise
          correspondence between 
          PM 
          
            kj 
           and

           are not enforced. This observation led to the idea
          of only using match probes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOID</ENAMEX> algorithm
          discussed above.
        
        
          MAS4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algorithm</ENAMEX> for Normalization
          MAS4 introduces a normalization factor (a scaling
          factor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAS4</TIMEX> serves the same purpose). The goal of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> is to reduce false positives in the
          expression fold change calculation and ensure
          housekeeping genes are marked as unchanged. Since it is
          usually unknown 
          a priori what genes sustain their
          expression level during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments, different
          heuristic normalization schemes may be adopted and it is
          unclear at this point which particular approach is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX>. MAS4 normally derives the normalization factor
          by scaling average 
          D 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           for all genes with expression levels within the
          central <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> to a certain target intensity constant. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> is based on the assumption that the total copy
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is a conserved number among
          experiments.
        
        
          MAS4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algorithm for Comparison Analysis</ENAMEX>
          In comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chips, we follow Affymetrix
          convention of calling the reference chip measurement as
          the base ( 
          b ), the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> as the
          experiment ( 
          e ). After the above normalization
          procedure, the fold change value for gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, f 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , is essentially calculated by dividing 
          D 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           ( 
          e ) with 
          D 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           ( 
          b ). MAS4 uses a filtering process
          to ensure that a common subset of "good" probe pairs
          between 
          b and 
          e are used to recalculate 
          D 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           . Very weak expression signals (sometimes negative)
          are rounded to the noise level mentioned before. The
          final formula for 
          f is:

          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marginally Increase"</ENAMEX>, or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marginally Decrease"</ENAMEX>. It is
          obvious that the fold change number is only meaningful if
          the probe set is clearly present at a level above the
          noise in both data sets.
