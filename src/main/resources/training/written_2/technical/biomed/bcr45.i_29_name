          Introduction
          Germline mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian cancer
          susceptibility gene 
          BRCA1 , which is located on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 17q21</ENAMEX>, are associated with a predisposition to
          the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in these organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. No
          mutations in the 
          BRCA1 gene have been detected in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sporadic breast cancer</ENAMEX> cases, but mutations have been
          detected in sporadic cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>].
          Although there is debate regarding the level of cancer
          risk associated with mutations in 
          BRCA1 and the significance of the
          lack of mutations in sporadic tumors, it is possible that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may occur by
          mechanisms other than mutation, leading to an
          underestimation of risk when it is calculated solely on
          the basis of mutational analysis. Such alterations cannot
          be identified until the function and regulation of BRCA1
          are better understood.
          The 
          BRCA1 gene encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX>-kDa
          nuclear phosphoprotein that is regulated in response to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>] and in response to
          estrogen-induced growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Germline
          mutations that cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian cancer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predisposition</ENAMEX> frequently result in truncated and
          presumably inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were derived from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with stage III,
          poorly differentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This
          cell line, which expresses wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX>, is estrogen
          responsive and withdrawal of estrogen results in eventual
          cell death. Previous studies suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> is
          stimulated as a result of estrogen treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>], and also that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may be involved in the cell
          death process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Therefore, we examined the effect of
          reduction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> on the cellular
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> depletion as well as estrogen
          stimulation. The results suggest that reduced levels of
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correlates</ENAMEX> with a survival advantage when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG</ENAMEX>-1
          cells are placed under growth-restrictive and
          hormone-depleted conditions. In optimum growth
          conditions, significantly reduced levels of BRCA1
          correlates with enhanced growth both 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo .
        
        
          Aims
          To test the hypothesis that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may play a role in
          the regulation of ovarian tumor cell death as well as in
          the inhibition of ovarian cell proliferation.
        
        
          Materials and methods
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor-positive, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1</ENAMEX> cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],

          Results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antisense</ENAMEX> technology was effective in decreasing both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX> in the BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> human ovarian
          adenocarcinoma cells. BRCA1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">antisense</NUMEX>-infected
          populations contained significantly less BRCA1 message
          than control LXSN-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and selected clones
          contained varying reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX>
          compared with control clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1aand 1b</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">BRCA1 antisense-</ENAMEX>infected cultures
          demonstrated a resistance to cell death induced by
          withdrawal from estrogen over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6- to 20-day</TIMEX> period (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2a). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> also exhibited a
          threefold to sixfold increase in cell growth compared
          with control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of estrogen treatment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1 BRCA1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> clones demonstrated a similar
          response to pooled population studies, enhanced growth
          with estrogen, and failure to die upon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> depletion
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense clones were further examined for
          other associated tumorigenic properties. All of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense</ENAMEX> clones were able to form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in soft agar
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-23 colonies per 10 4cells</NUMEX> plated; data not shown),
          whereas control clones were deficient in their ability to
          form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0-0.8 colonies per 10 4cells</NUMEX> plated).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX>, in the presence of estrogen, the clone with
          the lowest levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX>) produced significantly
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">133 Â± 17.9 colonies per 10 4cells</NUMEX> plated)
          than the control clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.1 colonies</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          4cells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plated</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clones AS-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> were also injected
          with matrigel subcutaneously into ovariectomized athymic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Almost twice as many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were positive for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) as for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> clone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 days after</TIMEX> injection. In addition, BRCA1
          antisense tumors averaged twice the size of control
          tumors. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> reduced cells also formed tumors with
          half the latency of control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of
          implanted estrogen (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> until tumor
          formation).
        
        
          Discussion
          The present studies show that reduction in BRCA1
          levels, using an antisense retroviral vector in the
          estrogen dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian carcinoma cell line,
          contributes to confirmation of the hypothesis that 
          BRCA1 plays a pivotal role in the
          balance between cell death and cell proliferation. 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were
          successfully reduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and isolated clones
          of antisense infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> cells. Decreased 
          BRCA1 levels rescued the BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
          from growth arrest or cell death in adverse growth
          conditions in monolayer or soft agar conditions.
          Furthermore, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense clone that had
          significantly low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> was able to
          form twice as many tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ovariectomized nude mice</ENAMEX>
          with a decreased latency compared with a control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>.
          In multicellular mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, a balance
          between cell proliferation and cell death is extremely
          important for the maintenance of normal healthy tissues.
          In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that 
          p53 and 
          BRCA1 can form stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>,
          and can coactivate 
          p21 and 
          bax <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which may lead to the
          activation of the apoptosis pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The present
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, which show that cells with a reduction of BRCA1
          have a survival advantage in conditions where control
          cells fail to thrive, also supports this hypothesis. 
          BRCA1 levels appear to affect the
          ability of cells to arrest growth or die in the absence
          of estrogenic growth-inducing conditions. Although
          mutations in this gene are uncommon in sporadic breast
          and ovarian tumors, 
          BRCA1 expression levels and protein
          levels have been found to be reduced in sporadic human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. In addition it has
          been demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent tumors
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> have a decreased
          ability to undergo apoptosis. Other mechanisms involving
          gene regulation may allow for decreased expression of 
          BRCA1 in sporadic tumors. The
          response of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitogens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro suggests that 
          BRCA1 may play a role in regulation
          of cell growth or maintenance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> gene
          product may be involved in the regulation of hormone
          response pathways, and the present results demonstrate
          that loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may result in loss of inhibitory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of these mitogenic pathways. These studies show
          that reduction in 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can result
          in increased proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian cancer cells
          in both 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo conditions, suggesting that
          
          BRCA1 may normally be acting as a
          growth inhibitor. Low <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> levels found in sporadic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> may be an important factor in tumorigenesis. The
          present data suggest that diminished levels of 
          BRCA1 not only accelerate
          proliferation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian carcinoma cell line,
          but also appear to promote tumorigenesis. We propose that
          the loss or reduction of 
          BRCA1 may predispose a cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to neoplastic transformation by altering the
          balance between cell death and proliferation/survival,
          rendering it more sensitive to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> genetic
          changes.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        Germline mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian cancer
        susceptibility gene 
        BRCA1 , which is located on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 17q21</ENAMEX>, are associated with a predisposition to
        the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in these organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Initial
        analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with germline mutations
        in the 
        BRCA1 gene and a strong family
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> or ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 and 44%</NUMEX>
        lifetime risks of developing breast and ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        respectively. Recent studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], however, have suggested
        that analyses based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were not selected for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">familial</ENAMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> indicate that the risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> associated with mutations in these genes is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, respectively. No
        mutations in the 
        BRCA1 gene have been detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sporadic breast cancer</ENAMEX> cases; however, mutations have been
        detected in sporadic cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>].
        Although there is debate regarding the level of cancer risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with mutations in 
        BRCA1 and the significance of the
        lack of mutations in sporadic tumors, it is possible that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may occur by
        mechanisms other than mutation. This would lead to an
        underestimation of risk when it is calculated solely on the
        basis of mutational analysis. Such alterations cannot be
        identified until the function and regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX> are

        The 
        BRCA1 gene encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX>-kDa nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that may be regulated by phosphorylation through
        the cell cycle and in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> is also regulated in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> or estrogen-induced growth in breast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>] and ovarian cell lines. BRCA1 has been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colocalize</ENAMEX> in nuclear dots with other cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BARD-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad51</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 25</ENAMEX>]. In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> can act as a transcriptional transactivator
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast reporter assays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>] and binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">polymerase II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">holoenzyme</ENAMEX>, a component of the basal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcription</ENAMEX> machinery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The precise mechanism of
        action and the specific signaling pathway affected by BRCA1
        remain unknown, however.
        Studies of 
        BRCA1 expression patterns in mouse
        tissue reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> is most highly expressed in
        tissues undergoing rapid proliferation and differentiation,
        and that expression 
        in vivo is also hormone responsive.
        For example, analyses of mammary gland growth and
        development show high levels of BRCA1 expression in
        terminal end <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> during puberty and in budding alveoli
        during pregnancy. In addition, hormonal stimulation in
        ovariectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> results in induction of BRCA1
        expression in the breast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Attempts to develop
        homozygous, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>-deleted mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have resulted in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryonic lethality</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. For example, when the 
        BRCA1 gene deletion was targeted in
        exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX>. Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> in the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> indicated that cell proliferation was impaired,
        suggesting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may paradoxically play a positive
        role in the regulation of embryonic cell growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Most of the mechanistic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> studies to date have been
        conducted in breast carcinoma cell lines; therefore, we
        decided to conduct a study to determine the effect of BRCA1
        expression on the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> of an ovarian
        carcinoma cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1</ENAMEX>. BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were derived from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with stage III, poorly differentiated ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This cell line, which expresses
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX>, is estrogen responsive, and withdrawal of
        estrogen results in eventual cell death. Previous studies
        suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> is stimulated as a result of estrogen
        treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>], and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may be involved
        in the cell death process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Therefore, we examined the
        effect of reduction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> on the
        cellular response to estrogen stimulation as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> depletion. Our results suggest that when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
        are subjected to growth restrictive and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-depleted
        conditions, cells that have even moderately reduced levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> have a distinct advantage for survival. In
        addition, significant reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> level
        correlates with enhanced estrogen proliferation when
        compared with cells that express moderate to wild-type
        BRCA1 levels, grown under optimal growth conditions both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo .

          adenocarcinoma cells. BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> human ovarian adenocarcinoma
          cells were infected with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retroviral</ENAMEX> construct composed
          of an antisense <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> base-pair cDNA sequence of the
          amino-terminal region of 
          BRCA1 . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> experiments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
          which were from independently made supernatants) showed
          that infection of pLXSN (vector alone) and 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> retroviral
          constructs into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1</ENAMEX> cells yielded G418-resistant

          Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4colony-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>/ml). The same vectors were
          also directly transfected into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> at an
          efficiency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3Ã—10</NUMEX> -5for the anti-sense

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> (pLXSN). Neomycin-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were pooled
          and examined for 
          BRCA1 message levels by
          ribonuclease protection assay. 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> infected cells
          contained significantly less 
          BRCA1 message than control LXSN
          infected cells, whether cultured in the presence or
          absence of estrogen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). Although there appears to
          be no detectable amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 RNA</ENAMEX> present after
          estrogen withdrawal, low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be
          detected by western blot analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
          Subclones were also isolated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> antisense
          infected cells, or LXSN infected cells (NEO). Western
          blot analysis demonstrated that all of the antisense
          BRCA1 clones had reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> compared
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> clones, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> antisense clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX>) had
          very low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX>, although it was not
          totally absent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b).

          BRCA1 BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were examined
          for growth in the absence or presence of supplemented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> independently infected cultures of 
          BRCA1 antisense cells demonstrated
          a resistance to cell death induced by withdrawal from
          estrogen over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-day</TIMEX> period, as well as a threefold to
          sixfold increase in cell growth compared with control
          cells in the presence of estrogen treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In
          order to investigate further whether reduction of BRCA1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> had an effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent cell growth,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> and control cells were grown in
          estrogen-deprived conditions for an extended period of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 5 days</TIMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> continued to
          proliferate in the absence of estrogen, but the BRCA1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> continued to grow for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 10 days</TIMEX>,
          whereas control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> decreased in number (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a).
          In order to avoid the problem of a mixed population of
          cells expressing various levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX>, subclones were
          isolated from infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> cells
          and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXSN</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> cells (NEO). Figure
          2bshows BG-1 parental and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> clones exhibited up to a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> decrease in cell number during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-day</TIMEX> period of
          estrogen withdrawal, whereas antisense 
          BRCA1 clones showed as much as a
          twofold increase in cell number during the same time
          period. In an attempt to determine if increased survival
          of the antisense cells was do to increased proliferation
          of the antisense cells or decreased death rate, the
          number of trypan blue positive, non-viable were examined
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> without estrogen. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-10-fold</NUMEX> more
          dead cells present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (BG-1
          parental and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> clone) then in the 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). It appeared that resistance to cell death
          plays a significant role in the survival of 
          BRCA1 antisense cells to estrogen
          withdrawal. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2bagain</NUMEX> demonstrates the ability of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense sub-clones to survive estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX>. In the presence of estrogen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> antisense 
          BRCA1 clones exhibited a growth
          advantage over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> clones or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> parental population
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). Antisense 
          BRCA1 clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3 and 4</TIMEX> showed a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold to 16</NUMEX>-fold increase in cell number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 5</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> after estrogen treatment compared with only a
          threefold to fivefold increase of cell number in NEO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 parental cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX>,
          which had the lowest levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX>, showed a
          highly significant (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-fold</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>) stimulation of growth
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 5</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of estrogen induction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figs</ENAMEX> 2band
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In summary, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
          antisense 
          BRCA1 clones had a growth advantage
          in the presence of estrogen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> antisense 
          BRCA1 clones showed enhanced
          survival in estrogen-depleted media.
        
        
          Anchorage independent growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG-1</ENAMEX> clones
          Anchorage independent growth is a common property of
          many transformed cells. Therefore, the 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> subclones were also
          studied for anchorage independent growth in a semisoft
          agar medium with and without supplemented estrogen.
          Table1 shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> formation efficiencies on
          plastic of control (NEO) and 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>sense (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX>) cells were
          similar in estrogen-depleted and estrogen-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> control clone (NEO) was unable
          to form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plated</ENAMEX>) in agar without the addition of estrogen, whereas
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> antisense 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> was able to form soft
          agar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in estrogen depleted conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 Â± 2.9</NUMEX>
          colonies per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4cells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plated</ENAMEX>). In the presence of
          estrogen, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> were able to form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>;
          however, there was a significant difference ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>) in the ability to form
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> in agar between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> clone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>). These data suggest a
          correlation between the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> and an
          increased survival/growth advantage in
          anchorage-independent conditions.
        
        
          Effects of reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> on in vivo tumor
          cell growth
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> clone showed a growth advantage in
          soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agar</ENAMEX>, a phenotype that may be correlated with the
          ability to form tumors 
          in vivo , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sub-clone AS-4</ENAMEX> was evaluated for its ability to form
          subcutaneous tumors in ovariectomized athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the
          presence or absence of an estrogen pellet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were
          injected subcutaneously with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> cells in matrigel on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and NEO cells in matrigel on the
          other side. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> injected, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> received an
          implanted estrogen pellet (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.18 mg estrogen</NUMEX>) that was
          designed to release estrogen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>. In the absence
          of estrogen, a significant difference was detected in
          tumorigenic growth between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> and NEO cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b).
          Almost twice as many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were tumor positive for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> clones than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> injected sites. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/14</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tumor</ENAMEX> formation was reached for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 days</TIMEX>
          after injection, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>)
          positive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b, upper
          panel). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> cells also formed tumors that averaged twice
          the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> control tumors (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b, lower
          panel).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> without matrigel were nontumorigenic in
          athymic male or female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> positive sites/20 sites
          injected at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5Ã—10 6cells</NUMEX> per site), but these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed
          large, progressively growing tumors when injected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrigel</ENAMEX> in the presence of estrogen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a). These
          tumors were very large (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>1cm diameter</ENAMEX>) and did not
          regress even though the estrogen pellet was effective for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 60 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Similar to the agar
          experiments, both the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense clone and LXSN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> were positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation in the
          presence of estrogen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> cells formed tumors with half
          of the latency of control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of
          implanted estrogen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</TIMEX> versus
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation). Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> nor NEO
          cells formed progressively growing tumors in the absence
          of estrogen, however. All tumors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without
          estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> had started to regress by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 days</TIMEX> after
          injection. The observed tumor regression was not
          surprising, because matrigel is not stable for longer
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> in culture, and probably not 
          in vivo either (personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication; Collaborative Biomedical Products</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 71</TIMEX>, the matrigel would no
          longer confer an optimal growth environment for BG-1
          cells.
        
        
          Discussion
          The present studies show that reduction of BRCA1
          levels, using an antisense retroviral vector in the
          estrogen dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian carcinoma cell line, may
          aid in confirmation of the hypothesis that 
          BRCA1 functions as a tumor
          suppressor gene by playing a pivotal role in the balance
          between cell death and cell proliferation. 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were
          successfully reduced in pooled and isolated subclones of
          antisense-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells. Decreased 
          BRCA1 levels appeared to affect the
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> to arrest growth or die in the
          absence of estrogenic growth-inducing conditions. We
          found that 
          BRCA1 antisense cells, both as
          pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subclones</ENAMEX>, also
          exhibited enhanced growth in monolayer culture on plastic
          in the presence of estrogen compared with control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense subclones
          were able to proliferate as well as exhibit a decreased
          death rate in estrogen-deprived media, whereas parental
          and control subclones failed to grow. Death after
          estrogen withdrawal has been shown in previous studies
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 35</TIMEX>]. BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> subclones
          demonstrated other traits associated with a tumorigenic
          phenotype, such as the ability to grow in soft agar
          independent of estrogen, whereas control clones could
          only form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> with the addition of estrogen. In
          ovariectomized nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> antisense clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX>)
          was examined for tumorigenicity compared with a control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> (NEO). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> formed a greater number of
          and larger tumors than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEO</ENAMEX> in the absence of estrogen,
          and in general formed tumors faster in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX>. The main conclusion from these studies is that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG-1</ENAMEX> clones with reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> have a
          survival advantage over controls in the absence of
          estrogen both 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo. 
          The response of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitogens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro suggests that 
          BRCA1 may play a role in regulation
          of cell growth or maintenance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">estrous</TIMEX>, many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and growth factors interact in a complex manner
          as survival factors and inducers of cell proliferation,
          which are then balanced with growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39, 40</TIMEX>]. The mechanism by which 
          BRCA1 can regulate or influence
          these processes has not yet been identified. It has been
          shown that 
          BRCA1 is induced as a result of the
          mitogenic activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> in estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-positive cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Direct estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> is not required for 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>, however [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>]. In support of this, 
          BRCA1 expression has been shown to
          occur in the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovary</ENAMEX> (granulosa and thecal cells of
          small and medium follicles) independent of hormonal
          status, and even in ovaries from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>]. In contrast, the tumors from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
          BRCA1 mutations appear to have
          downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44, 45</TIMEX>].
          Previous experiments in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> showed that
          another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>, could also cause a modest
          increase of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h
          exposure without an increase in growth (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Progesterone</ENAMEX> has been found [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] to inhibit cell
          proliferation and induce apoptosis significantly in two
          ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Thus, although 
          BRCA1 may not be regulated directly
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> gene product may be involved in
          the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> response pathways, and the
          present results may demonstrate that loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX> may
          result in loss of inhibitory control of these mitogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
          
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> is regulated
          with the cell cycle, and highest levels correlate with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S-phase</ENAMEX> boundary [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 9, 41</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47, 48, 49</TIMEX>]. The
          present studies show that reduction of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can result
          in increased proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian cancer cells 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo , suggesting that 
          BRCA1 may normally be acting as a
          growth inhibitor. Similar to our findings with ovarian
          carcinoma cells, accelerated growth, anchorage
          independence and tumorigenicity is associated with 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense</ENAMEX> introduction into
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIH3T3 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. In addition, increased
          proliferation of mammary cells is induced with antisense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> to 
          BRCA1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. Conversely,
          introduction of full-length 
          BRCA1 by retrovirus-mediated gene
          transfer inhibited growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian cancer
          cell lines in both 
          in vitro and 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>], and
          transfection of 
          BRCA1 into colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells
          inhibited new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in addition to
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> progression, possibly through
          direct transactivation of the cell cycle inhibitor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p21 WAF1/CIP1</ENAMEX>[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
          In multicellular mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, a balance
          between cell proliferation and cell death is extremely
          important for the maintenance of normal healthy tissues.
          This is especially important during early embryonic
          development as well as in the development and function of
          adult tissues such as the gonadal cells (ie ovarian and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testes</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 48</TIMEX>]. For example, 
          BRCA1 expression is critical during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality in
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 52</TIMEX>]. Alternatively,
          overexpression of 
          BRCA1 may activate apoptosis or
          cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Human prostate cells with an introduced
          wild-type 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> demonstrated a threefold
          to sixfold increase in chemosensitivity, as well as an
          increased susceptibility to drug-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>].
          We found that clones with even moderately reduced levels
          of 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> appeared to be
          relatively resistant to death due to estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX>. Previous studies in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> showed
          that response of parental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BG-1 cells</ENAMEX> and antisense clones
          to gamma radiation were consistent with a 
          p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wildtype</ENAMEX> phenotype, indicating
          that loss of estrogen dependence is probably not due to a
          
          p53 mutation (unpublished data).
          Shao 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] demonstrated that 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transfected</ENAMEX> into mouse 3T3
          fibroblasts resulted in increased programmed cell death.
          In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that 
          p53 and 
          BRCA1 can form stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>,
          and can coactivate 
          p21 and 
          bax <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which may lead to the
          activation of the apoptosis pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The present
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, which show that cells with a reduction in BRCA1
          have a survival advantage in conditions where control
          cells fail to thrive, also supports this hypothesis.
          Like 
          p53 , 
          BRCA1 has also been implicated in
          DNA damage and repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 48, 54</ENAMEX>]. According to
          this model, cells without normal 
          BRCA1 activity may accumulate
          genetic alterations as a result of failure to arrest and
          repair DNA damage or self-destruct, thereby leading to
          genomic instability and neoplastic progression. It may
          not be coincidental that 
          BRCA1 -mutant breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> linked to a 'specific' histopathologic
          pattern that includes a high S-phase fraction of cells,
          aneuploidy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> receptor-negative status [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
          In addition, it has been demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone-dependent tumors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> have a decreased ability to undergo apoptosis.
          Although mutations in this gene are uncommon in sporadic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian tumors, 
          BRCA1 expression levels and protein
          levels have been found to be reduced in sporadic human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. Other mechanisms
          that involve gene regulation may allow for decreased
          expression of 
          BRCA1 in sporadic tumors.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypermethylation</ENAMEX> has been observed in some sporadic
          breast tumors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region of 
          BRCA1 , which may account for
          decreased 
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. Low
          BRCA1 levels found in sporadic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> may play an
          important role in tumorigenesis. The present data suggest
          that diminished levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX> not only accelerate
          proliferation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG-1</ENAMEX> ovarian carcinoma cell line,
          but appear to alter tumorigenesis. The exact mechanism
          may be unknown, but decreased 
          BRCA1 levels appear to affect the
          ability to arrest growth or die in the absence of
          estrogenic growth-inducing conditions. We propose that
          the loss or reduction of 
          BRCA1 may predispose a cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to neoplastic transformation by altering the
          balance between cell death and proliferation/survival,
          rendering it more sensitive to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> genetic
          changes.
