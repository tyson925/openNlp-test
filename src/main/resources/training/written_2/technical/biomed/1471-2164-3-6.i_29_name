        Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic atrial rhythm resulting
        from abnormal signal generation and conduction in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atria</ENAMEX>. The molecular basis for atrial fibrillation remains
        unknown. It usually occurs in association with structural
        or metabolic abnormalities. Atrial fibrillation, however,
        does occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with none of these causes,
        referred to as lone atrial fibrillation. Recently, we
        identified several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of multiple generations
        affected with atrial fibrillation with no other underlying
        cause detected. This subset of familial atrial fibrillation
        provides an opportunity to explore a molecular basis for
        atrial fibrillation.
        Atrial fibrillation segregates as an autosomal dominant
        disease characterized by atrial fibrillation on an
        electrocardiogram [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . We diagnosed atrial fibrillation
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in which the arrhythmia was the
        primary manifestation and not associated with any gross
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> or metabolic abnormality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Genetic linkage
        analysis was performed and the locus responsible for atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was mapped to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10q22</TIMEX> between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D101786</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D10S1630</ENAMEX>, an area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . We proceeded with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene approach and DLG5
        was on of the genes mapped to the critical region between
        the flanking markers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . This gene belongs to the MAGUK
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Membrane Associated Gyanylate Kinase</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        known to form scaffolds for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
        intracellular signal transduction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> family
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been extensively studied in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>
        and shown to play a role in the formation of cell
        junctions, maintenance of cell shape, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] and
        clustering of channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at the cell surface [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX>
        ] . Given its location in our critical region and its
        function it was selected as a candidate for atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX>. A partial cDNA sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX> (GenBank
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession #AB011155</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K B</ENAMEX> was available. To
        determine if there is a mutation responsible for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, it is necessary to have the complete cDNA.
        Furthermore, recognizing that the responsible mutation may
        be present in one of the intron-exon splice junctions, it
        is also necessary to obtain the corresponding genomic
        sequence. Thus, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
        DLG5 gene and, from the complete cDNA sequence, determined
        the intron-exon boundaries of the gene as well as its human
        tissue expression profile.

          multiple RACE reactions using heart and placental cDNA
          until no further extension was made to the cDNA
          suggesting we had reached the end of the gene.
          In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>, we also used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCR</ENAMEX> based heart
          library screening (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Origene Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat#1001</ENAMEX>). We
          isolated a clone that matched our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RACE clone</ENAMEX> which gave
          confirmation to the cDNA sequence generated by the RACE
          technique. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sequencer 3.1</ENAMEX> program to assemble our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. There was considerable overlap between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">305</NUMEX>
          bp fragment of the new sequence and that of the published
          cDNA of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX>. We identified an ORF with a stop codon
          preceding it indicating we had obtained the entire coding
          region of the gene. The complete cDNA sequence has been

          The newly generated <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> cDNA sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.195</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb</ENAMEX>) was
          subjected to a search for homology to genomic sequences

          employed to assemble genomic sequences from these BACs
          and to map the cDNA to these sequences. The genomic

          Analysis of patient DNA
          Using available genomic sequences, primers were
          designed to analyze the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Primers were
          anchored in introns and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products generated from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ng
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼M each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>
          Î¼M of forward and reverse primers each and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> units of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taq Polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life Technologies</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was done on
          PE9600 or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PE9700</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">thermocycler</ENAMEX>. Sequencing reactions were
          performed using fluorescent labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Dye</ENAMEX> terminator
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA) on a PE9600
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermocycler</ENAMEX>. Each reaction was then cleaned over the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Edge Biosystems</ENAMEX> column and subsequently sequenced on an
          ABI310 or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ABI377</NUMEX> genetic analyzer. Sequences were
          assembled using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sequencer 3.1</ENAMEX> program.
        
        
          Use of a novel technique to rule out deletion
          mutations
          We utilized a newly available somatic cell hybrid
          technique from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMP Genetics, Inc.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] to obtain haploid
          cell lines. In brief, this technology provides a means
          whereby the two homologous chromosomes are separated and
          isolated into separate cell lines. Our affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          diploid leucocytic cell line was converted to haploid
          somatic cell hybrid lines. The hybrid cell lines were
          screened to identify those cell lines that contain the
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> homologues. We further confirmed by
          genotyping that the DNA of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these haploid lines had
          the alleles segregating with the disease. Thus, if a
          mutation in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene is responsible for the disease
          it would be in this cell line. We then performed PCR
          using primers anchored in the introns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DLG5</ENAMEX> for each of
          the exons on both the normal haploid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the disease
          bearing haploid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The presence of amplification
          products from both haploid lines would detect any exon
          deletion that may have eluded detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Human tissue expression patterns of DLG5
          The expression pattern of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene was analyzed
          in multiple adult human tissues by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Blot Analysis</ENAMEX>
          using as a probe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX> clone <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#409942</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ym59b11</TIMEX>)
          with insert an size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.386</NUMEX> Kb which contains exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' untranslated region of the gene. A
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-four</NUMEX> hour exposure showed abundant expression in
          placenta with minimal expression in skeletal muscle,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, kidney and pancreas and no expression in heart
          (data not shown). Exposure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> showed expression
          in heart, no expression in the brain and abundant
          expression in placenta as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. We observed
          a single transcript of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kb</ENAMEX> thus, the
          published sequence of the cDNA for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene was
          incomplete.

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 7.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb</ENAMEX> was observed. Using Race Technique
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Heart cDNA</ENAMEX> and heart library screening as described
          above we characterized the entire cDNA of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.195</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb</ENAMEX>: a
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5'UTR</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bp 1 to 94</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bp 95-5547</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3'UTR</NUMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bp 5548-7195</ENAMEX>. The translation start codon of the cDNA is
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bp 118</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX> and the stop codon is at bp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5545</TIMEX> in
          exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>. As multiple clones were sequenced after RACE, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          distinct forms were observed: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nucleotide
          deletion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of exon 4</TIMEX> and the form without
          the deletion. The deletion did not result in any change
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> of the gene.

          Determining the intron exon boundaries of
          DLG5
          We mapped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31 exons</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-32</ENAMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.195</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kb</ENAMEX> of the cDNA
          to a genomic region spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 79 Kb</NUMEX>. We could not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">map 1-94 bp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'UTR</ENAMEX>) on to the genomic region. This may be
          because none of these BACs are completely sequenced in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> and there are still gaps in the genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>. Attempts at direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> walking to place these
          nucleotides were unsuccessful, perhaps because these
          regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> are difficult to sequence due to
          its secondary structure. The details of the genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the gene are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> Figure

          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Determining the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in DLG50
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 10</ENAMEX> ] have
          characteristic domains which are present in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">DLG5: PDZ1</TIMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bp 3763-4074, PDZ 2 domain 4186-4518 bp, SH3 domain bp</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4570-4782</TIMEX> and the GUK domain at bp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4915-5539</TIMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> were identified in the novel cDNA
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MOTIF</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEQ WEB</ENAMEX>. A single repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromosomal Chromatin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RCC1</NUMEX>) domain was
          detected starting at bp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4333</TIMEX>. RCC1 is a eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven</NUMEX> tandem repeats units which
          comprise a domain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This domain binds
          to chromatin and interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ran</ENAMEX>, a nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTP-binding protein</ENAMEX> that stimulates a guanine nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissociation</ENAMEX>. Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RCC1</TIMEX> probably plays a role as a gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> repeat unit is present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX> which
          makes it difficult to predict whether it also has such
          gene regulating function.
          A prenyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-binding site (CAAX <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box</ENAMEX>) was also
          detected starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5536</TIMEX> bp. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          post translationally modified by the attachment of either
          a fresnyl or a geranyl-geranyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to a cysteine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. This modification occurs on a cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues proximal</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          aliphatic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> separating the cysteine from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (hence the term CAAX <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box</ENAMEX>). Certain proteins
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ras</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ras</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Rho</ENAMEX>,
          nuclear lamins A and B and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein alpha subunits
          have this modification. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in
          intracellular signal transduction. This is another
          mechanism by which DLG5 may be involved in intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction. In addition to these domains there
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leucine zippers starting at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">484</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX> suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Exclusion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG50</TIMEX> as a candidate for familial
          atrial fibrillation in our family
          The exons and flanking intronic sequences of DLG50
          were amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and sequenced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> affected and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> normals. There were no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">missense</ENAMEX> or nonsense mutations segregating with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in either the coding regions or splice junctions
          of this gene. To exclude a large deletion that might have
          eluded amplification from diploid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> sequencing
          was performed on the haploid cell lines and no mutation
          was identified. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DLG50</ENAMEX> is excluded as a possible
          cause of familial atrial fibrillation in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          Utilizing the available partial cDNA sequence, we
          confirmed the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> to the locus for
          atrial fibrillation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10q22</TIMEX> and subsequently cloned and
          sequenced the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene which spanned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX>. The
          available <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX> cDNA sequence was extended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RACE</ENAMEX> and
          confirmed on northern analysis to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX>. The
          genomic structure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the DLG5</TIMEX> was determined to consist
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> exons and shown to have ubiquitous human tissue
          expression including placenta, heart, skeletal muscle,
          liver and pancreas, with placenta being the tissue of
          strongest expression. Exclusion of a deletion from the
          haploid cell lines confirmed the absence of any mutation
          and thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX> was excluded as a cause for the atrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> distinct transcripts
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX> were observed differing by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 12 bp</TIMEX>, which
          would predict the addition (or deletion) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, but would not alter the translation frame of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene encodes for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is a member
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Membrane Associated Guan</ENAMEX> late Kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> located in the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> is a new family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
          act as a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffold</ENAMEX> for intracellular signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
          characterized by domains that interact with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to create an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of large multi-protein
          complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDZ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PSD-95</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZO-1</ENAMEX>) domains
          are the best characterized for their binding to the
          C-terminal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and transmembrane proteins
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Usually each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> copies of such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12 13</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> homology <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) are
          present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          to signaling molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The presence of this
          domain in MAGUKs increases their possibilities of
          interacting with signaling pathways. The GUK domain shows
          a high degree of similarity to guanylate kinase enzyme,
          which converts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMP</ENAMEX> to GDP using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphate donor</ENAMEX>.
          The dlg-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUKs</ENAMEX> do not have kinase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          Furthermore this domain has been shown to interact with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUKs</ENAMEX> function by binding
          to the transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at the cytoplasmic side and
          to other signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and thus appear to
          provide the platform for efficient and specific signal
          interactions between the different components of the
          signaling pathway. Acting as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scaffold proteins</ENAMEX>, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> play a pivotal role in creating an efficient
          signaling pathway by localizing the signaling molecules
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of cell surface preferentially exposed to the
          ligand, and by spatially restricting the molecules to
          provide specific downstream responses.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DLG5</NUMEX> gene encodes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDZ</ENAMEX> domains, with another
          region in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N-terminus</ENAMEX> having very weak homology to an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDZ</ENAMEX> domains. It is notable that the PDZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> predicted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DLG5 protein</ENAMEX> do not have the
          GLGF motif [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , present in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the MAGUK
          family. This motif helps in the binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have the consensus E
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/T</ENAMEX>) Ã (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/l</ENAMEX>) motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However the studies on the
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein InaD</ENAMEX>, which also has a PDZ domain,
          show that are other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for the PDZ domain that do
          not have the consensus C-terminus binding motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          Thus in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DLG5</TIMEX> the PDZ domain may be binding to other
          targets that do not require the classic GLGF motif for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX>. Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this family DLG5 also
          has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUK</ENAMEX> domain. In addition it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          leucine zippers and an RCC1 domain that represents other
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>.
          Previously reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUKs</ENAMEX> have been studied for these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, and elegant work has shown one of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p55</TIMEX>, to form a ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that links the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> and the plasma membrane to maintain proper
          cell shape [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Also there is significant evidence
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUKs</ENAMEX> are active in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein clustering</ENAMEX> especially
          of ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and membrane bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> has been proven by experiments in which DLG5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> show loss of clustering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">neuromuscular</ENAMEX> junction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mammalian PSD-95</ENAMEX> is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUK</ENAMEX> which binds <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kir4.1</ENAMEX>, an inwardly rectifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> expressed in glial cells and also clusters it to
          cell membranes in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGUKs</ENAMEX> may regulate
          the distribution and also the function of transmembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Given these observations, its pattern of expression in
        the human adult heart, we considered it to be an excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for the familial atrial fibrillation and
        evaluated it in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> by sequencing. We have ruled out
        functional mutation in the coding region and splice
        junction as well as any exon deletion as possible cause of
        the disease in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This gene remains an
        interesting candidate for other inherited cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
