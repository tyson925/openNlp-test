        Movement of eukaryotic cells, intracellular transport,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, cell division and cell shape are functions of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The cytoskeleton is made up
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of filaments: actin filaments, intermediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX> and microtubules. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> called
        molecular motors utilize energy from the hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        to move in association with the cytoskeleton: kinesins,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyneins</ENAMEX> and myosins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinesins</ENAMEX> and dyneins move
        along microtubules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 7</ENAMEX>] and actin is utilized by myosin
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">motility</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        Molecular motors in non-plant systems have been
        extensively characterized but less is known about the
        presence and functions of these motors in plant cells.
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse dynein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 400</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco pollen</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen germination</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>] suggesting the presence of dynein in pollen tubes. To
        date, no report has been published on the presence of
        dynein at the molecular level. Using animal dynein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to search the 
        Arabidopsis database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAIR</ENAMEX> (The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Information Resource</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>], no sequences similar to heavy or intermediate chains
        were found. However, some sequences showing similarity to
        light chains are present in the database. Kinesins have
        been identified in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> systems [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>] and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> along microtubules
        has been analyzed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. Kinesins are a
        superfamily of molecular motors containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least nine</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 20</ENAMEX>]. Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> are represented in all
        but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Using the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
        the motor domain of a plant kinesin, a search of the 
        Arabidopsis genome yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
        kinesin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. This is the largest number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> per thousand genes compared to
        yeast, 
        Drosophila melanogaster and 
        Caenorhabditis elegans. 
        Phylogenetic analysis of known myosins in various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> has resulted in the classification of myosins
        into several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosin Home Page</ENAMEX> (MHP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] has a
        phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        classes. However, an analysis of the myosin superfamily in 
        Drosophila, concluded that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">myosins</ENAMEX> and a 
        Drosophila myosin make up a new class
        of myosins, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XVIII</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. These myosins have a unique
        amino-terminal PDZ domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> have been named
        according to the order in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> was first
        discovered except for myosins I and II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myosin II</ENAMEX> is the
        conventional myosin, which was discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years ago</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. The next myosin identified was myosin I and then in
        order of class name. Myosins have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains in common;
        a motor domain that interacts with actin and binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, a
        neck domain that binds light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> or calmodulin and a
        tail domain. The tail domain varies by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. Phylogenetic
        analysis is often based on the motor domain of the myosins.
        However, using the full-length sequence results in nearly
        the same grouping, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and tails have
        evolved together [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. A study using the head
        (motor domain), neck and tail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> separately for
        phylogenetic analysis or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck/tail showed that
        this is generally true [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. The neck domain consists of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more helical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> termed the IQ motif, which
        has the consensus sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IQXXXRGXXXR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The IQ motif
        binds the conventional myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> or calmodulin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in other myosins [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>]. Unlike most calmodulin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, myosins bind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> in the absence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+.
        As actin is utilized by myosin for motility, the
        possible functions of myosin in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are closely linked
        to the functions of actin. The actin cytoskeleton has been
        shown to be involved in many processes in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, signaling, cell division, cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streaming</ENAMEX> and morphogenesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Much of the
        cytoplasmic streaming work has been done in algal cells and
        the direct involvement of actin and myosin has been shown [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX>, biochemical and cell biological studies
        with trichomes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</TIMEX> have provided
        interesting insights into the role of the cytoskeleton in
        trichome morphogenesis. These studies indicate that actin
        and the microtubule cytoskeleton play a pivotal role in
        cell expansion and branching during trichome development [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Localization</ENAMEX> studies and visualization of the actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> in live cells with an actin-binding protein
        tagged with green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) indicate that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin changes during trichome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chemicals</ENAMEX> that promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolymerization</ENAMEX> or stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton
        did not effect branching but produced distorted trichomes.
        The morphology of these trichomes is similar to that
        observed in a 'distorted' class of mutants, suggesting that
        at least some of the affected genes are likely to code for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in actin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>/dynamics (for
        example myosins, actin-depolymerizing factors,
        actin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>). There is also evidence that the
        actin cytoskeleton is involved in mitosis and during
        separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells after the successful
        segregation of chromosomes into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter nuclei</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The
        actin cytoskeleton is also involved in pollen tube growth,
        and calcium regulation has also been shown to be involved [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>].
        Myosins have been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemically</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38, 39, 40</TIMEX>] and at the molecular level
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. Immunological detection of myosins using
        antibodies against animal myosin identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
        various sizes from different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45, 46</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> studies localized myosin to the surface
        of organelles, the vegetative nuclei and generative cells
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen grains</ENAMEX> and tubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], to the active streaming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lanes</ENAMEX> and cortical surface in pollen tubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] and, more
        recently, to plasmodesmata in root tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 47</TIMEX>].
        Motility assays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49, 50</TIMEX>] using
        myosin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have also
        demonstrated the presence of myosins in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> partial or full-length myosins from 
        Arabidopsis have been characterized
        at the molecular level. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>-based approaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knight</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kendrick-Jones</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] cloned a myosin they called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> ( 
        Arabidopsis thaliana myosin), Kinkema
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schiefelbein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] cloned the myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MYA1</ENAMEX> and Kinkema 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] cloned another
        full-length myosin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATM2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> partial length myosins
        MYA2 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MYA3</TIMEX>. Kinekema 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] also identified three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products that coded for unique myosin motor domain
        sequence. Phylogenetic analysis using these myosins
        indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> myosins were a unique class and they
        were named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYA</ENAMEX> myosins are somewhat related
        to class V myosins but as other analyses have been done,
        these myosins were also assigned to a new class, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 42</ENAMEX>].
        Myosins have been identified in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zea mays</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which belonged to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class XI</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. PCR fragments for
        fern myosins have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>] and sequences are
        available for myosins from 
        Helianthus annuus (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vugrek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
        Menzel, unpublished data). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> fern ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Anemia phyllitidis</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products and
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> annuus myosins also fall either
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class VIII</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 42</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> algal
        myosins are also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX>, one from 
        Chara corallina and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from 
        Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 54</TIMEX>].
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> class of myosins (XIII) is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> algal
        myosins from 
        Acetabularia cliftonii. No animal
        myosins are in any of these classes and no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins
        are in any other myosin class. However, the cellular slime
        mold 
        Dictyostelium discoideum has one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd MyoJ</ENAMEX>), which is alternatively grouped with class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have myosins from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> classes.
        The yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different classes. 
        Caenorhabditis elegans has myosins in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> classes and 
        Drosophila melanogaster in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>. Do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> classes of myosins? How many myosins
        are in a plant genome? What are the similarities and
        differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and non-plant myosins that might
        help establish a function for the myosins? Until the recent
        completion of the sequencing of the 
        Arabidopsis genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>], answers to
        these questions were not known. It is now possible to
        determine how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> are in the 
        Arabidopsis genome and to see if any
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> fall into other myosin classes. As the myosin
        motor domain is highly conserved, the sequence from one
        myosin motor can be used to search a database for all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX>. We used the motor domain from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MYA1</TIMEX> to search the 
        Arabidopsis database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] for
        sequences with similarity to this domain. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> 
        Arabidopsis myosins, including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        reported myosins, in the 
        Arabidopsis genome. Phylogenetic
        analysis using non-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and plant myosins showed that all
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17</TIMEX> fall into either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin class VIII</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 4</NUMEX> are in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class VIII</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX>. An analysis of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon/intron</ENAMEX> junctions and sequence similarities indicates
        that all myosins are highly conserved and some may
        represent gene duplication events.

          reported in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          are sequences obtained from the 
          Arabidopsis database sequenced as
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing Project</ENAMEX>. These
          sequences are, therefore, predicted sequences that have
          not been verified by complete cDNAs. The average sequence
          length of the 
          Arabidopsis myosins is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, with the shortest sequence prediction being
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,085</NUMEX> (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIIIA</ENAMEX>) amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and the longest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,730</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIA</ENAMEX>). Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX>/exon predictions may not be
          correct, which could reduce or increase the size of the
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and so the sizes may change as more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX> is done for each myosin. A case in point
          is the cDNA that was isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinkema</ENAMEX> and Schiefelbein
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] for At MYA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At MYA1</NUMEX>) which codes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,520</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, whereas the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,599</NUMEX> because of
          differences in intron prediction.
          Using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis Sequence Map Overview</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>], the location of each myosin was determined
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The myosin genes are distributed throughout
          the 
          Arabidopsis genome. The chromosome
          lengths are based on the centimorgan (cM) scale as shown
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAIR Map Overview</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. The maps reported with
          the announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome sequence show
          somewhat different lengths than the TAIR maps [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Phylogenetic analysis
          All 
          Arabidopsis myosins and a selection
          of myosins from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> representing each of the
          myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were aligned using the motor domain
          sequence as determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMART</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. The
          alignment was done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Megalign</ENAMEX> by the CLUSTAL method and
          a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was generated using the Bootstrap
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 replicates</NUMEX>) method with a heuristic search of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b6</ENAMEX> program (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The 
          Arabidopsis myosins all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes along with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins - class</ENAMEX> VIII
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX>. No animal myosins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> into any of the animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX>. An algal ( 
          Chara corallina ) myosin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cc</ENAMEX> ccm,
          does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> but is on a
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> from any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosin</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoJ did
          not fall into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins. In
          fact, three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosins (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoI, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX>
          myoJ, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoM) did not fall into any of the classes
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cope</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> on the myosin home page [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 59</TIMEX>] show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX>
          myoI branching from class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> myosins. A heuristic search
          without bootstrapping also showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoI myosin as a
          branch from class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> and domain analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myoI</ENAMEX> has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the MyTH4</TIMEX> domain found in other class <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VII</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX>. Other phylogenetic anaylses have placed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoJ
          as a branch off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 59</TIMEX>].
          However, the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> generated from full-length
          sequences of plant myosins and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoJ (see below) also
          shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dd</ENAMEX> myoJ is separate from the plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX>.
          Myosins from another alga, 
          Acetabularia cliftonii, are
          classified into a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (XIII) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> myosin
          each from the fungi 
          Emericella nidulans and 
          Pyricularia grisea are also
          assigned to a separate class (XVII). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> alignment
          was done using the full-length sequences for all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and other known
          full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins with a human heavy-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> myosin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hs Ib</ENAMEX>) as an outgroup. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of plant myosins
          are clearly seen (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX> myosins
          the similarity ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-85%</NUMEX> (full length) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61-91%</NUMEX> (motor domain). The similarity between the class
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-83%</NUMEX> (full length) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64-92%</NUMEX>
          (motor domain). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII myosins are compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class XI</ENAMEX> myosins the similarity only ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22-29%</NUMEX>
          (full-length) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-42%</NUMEX> (motor domain). Thirteen 
          Arabidopsis myosins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class XI</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> branch off in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> outliers (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subgroup</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          pairs of 
          Arabidopsis myosins, At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIB/</ENAMEX>At MYA2
          and At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIG/At XIH</ENAMEX>, which are most similar to the
          sunflower myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hahamy4</ENAMEX> and then another pair of 
          Arabidopsis myosins, At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XID/At XIA</ENAMEX>.
          The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subgroup</ENAMEX> consists of the 
          Arabidopsis myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIC/At</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIE</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unpaired 
          Arabidopsis myosins, At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIK</ENAMEX> and At
          MYA1, that are most closely related to sunflower myosins
          Hahamy2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hahamy5</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize myosin ZmMYO1</ENAMEX>. At
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIJ</ENAMEX>, AT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIF</ENAMEX> and At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>-I are on separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> but not within the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII 
          Arabidopsis myosins that form two

          are on a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Characterization of the Arabidopsismyosins
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> schematic diagrams of each myosin. The
          motor domain in all cases is in the amino-terminal
          region. The motor domain starts at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50-55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII myosins
          have a longer amino-terminal region before the motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99-159</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>). The IQ domains usually follow
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">right</TIMEX> after the motor domain but are separated slightly
          from the motor domain in At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XID</ENAMEX>, At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">XI-I</ENAMEX>, and At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIK</ENAMEX>.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> IQ domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class VIII</ENAMEX> myosins
          and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX>, except for At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIK</ENAMEX>, which has
          only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. There are coiled-coil domains, that differ in
          length and number, in all the myosins. They often follow
          directly after the IQ domains, but in some cases there is
          intervening sequence. Based on the presence of the
          coiled-coil domains, the 
          Arabidopsis myosins are probably
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimeric</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> are much longer than
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII myosins with the difference being in the
          length of the carboxy-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> following the
          conserved domains found in myosins.
          Besides the motor, IQ and coiled-coil domains, other
          domains have been identified in myosins from classes
          other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>. These include
          SH3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> homology <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> domains, that bind to target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MYTH4</TIMEX> (a domain of unknown function found in a
          few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of myosins), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-binding domain, a
          pleckstrin homology domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERM/talin</ENAMEX> (band
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> and a protein
          kinase domain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 22, 26</ENAMEX>]. These domains are involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX> and presumably give specificity to
          the action of the myosin. Except for the IQ and
          coiled-coil domains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMART</ENAMEX> program used to identify
          the motor domain of the myosin sequences did not identify
          any domains other than a few with scores less significant
          than the required threshold.
          Myosins have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> spread
          throughout the motor domain that define a core consensus
          sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Comparison of an alignment of 
          Arabidopsis myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor domains</ENAMEX> to
          these conserved sequences shows a great deal of
          conservation among them (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding site which consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GESGAGKT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">179-187</ENAMEX>
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Dictyostelium myosin II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmyoII</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NxNSSR-FGK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">233-241</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmyoII</ENAMEX>). With the exception of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> residue these are conserved in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> 
          Arabidopsis myosins. The
          conformational <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of myosin changes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> and a very conserved region implicated in this
          process has the conserved sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDIxGFExFxxN</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/G</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/L</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EQxxINxxNExLQQxF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">453-482</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmyoII</ENAMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> sequences are very conserved through
          this region. The sequence in this region is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDIYGFExFxxNSFEQxCINE</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K/R</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LQQHF</ENAMEX> (the first x is S in all
          but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> myosin, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> x is F in all but one myosin).
          Cope 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] suggest that release
          of the γ-phosphate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> may be through a hole in the
          structure centered around an absolutely conserved
          arginine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue 654</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmyoII</ENAMEX>) which is also
          absolutely conserved in all 
          Arabidopsis myosins. The presence
          of these highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins
          suggests that they are capable of motor function. In
          fact, 
          in vitro motility studies with a
          purified myosin from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chara</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin XI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cc</ENAMEX> ccm in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) have confirmed that it is indeed an actin-based motor
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. A loop present in the motor domain called the HCM
          (mutations in this loop cause hypertrophic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiomyopathy</ENAMEX>) is the location of a phosphorylatable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) or threonine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) in certain amoeboid myosin I
          molecules and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin VI</ENAMEX> molecules. This S or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 residues</NUMEX> upstream from the conserved DALAK sequence.
          The enzyme activity of the amoeboid myosins depends on
          phosphorylation of this site, but although
          phosphorylation of the myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI T</ENAMEX> residue has been
          demonstrated, the regulation of enzyme activity has not [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 63</ENAMEX>]. Most other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> have a constitutively
          negatively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)
          or glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) at this site. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> has been
          named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEDS</ENAMEX> rule site on the basis of these amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins
          all have aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamic acid</ENAMEX> or glycine residue
          at this site, suggesting that they are not regulated by
          phosphorylation at this site. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALAK</ENAMEX>), all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> have a

          The site for each predicted or actual intron was
          located and is shown schematically in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding nucleotides</ENAMEX>) with an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII myosins have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> exons
          of the same length in the same order within the myosin
          motor domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The motor domain starts in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> exon of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII myosin. The start of the IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and the coiled-coil domains is more variable
          except for the At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ATM2/</ENAMEX>At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIIIB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. The class XI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> also have many exons that are of the same length
          and in the same order but that differ from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII
          pattern (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The exons coding for the motor domain
          sequence are most conserved in length. Most class XI
          myosins motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> start in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> exon and end in
          the twentieth. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> have an intron
          after the start codon. Most differences in exon length
          are in the carboxy-terminal regions (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6and Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, even in the carboxy-terminal region there
          are some exon lengths conserved between some or all of
          the myosins. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">XI myosins</ENAMEX> with the closest
          similarity are At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIB</ENAMEX> and At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MYA2</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal</ENAMEX> alignment at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pole Bio-Informatique Lyonnais</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>] showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.88%</NUMEX>
          identity, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.19%</NUMEX> strong similarity and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.36%</NUMEX> weak
          similarity between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two myosins</TIMEX>. Their motor domains
          are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91.6%</NUMEX> identical. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> of their introns are at
          the same location in the motor domain area and then
          following a few different size exons, there are similar
          sized exons again. They are located on chromosomes I and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, respectively. It is possible that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is a
          result of gene duplication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Class VIII</ENAMEX> myosins At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> and
          At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIIIA</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> exons of the same length. Their
          full-length sequences are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> identical with another
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.72%</NUMEX> strongly similar and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.52%</NUMEX> weakly similar. Their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> domains have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> similarity. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> is on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome III</ENAMEX> whereas At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIIIA</ENAMEX> is on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> This
          again may have resulted from a gene duplication. Analysis
          of the total 
          Arabidopsis genome revealed that a
          whole genome duplication occurred, followed by subsequent
          gene loss and extensive local gene duplications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>].
          The duplicated segments represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of the 
          Arabidopsis genome. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae genome has also had a
          complete ancient genome duplication and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the genes
          form duplicate pairs. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Duplicated genes</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of
          the total genes of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>].
          If the gene pairs are the result of duplication, it is
          interesting to note that while exon lengths have been
          conserved, intron lengths have not. The intron lengths
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. No pattern can be seen in intron
          lengths between any of the myosins. The average intron
          length is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> nucleotides with the shortest intron at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and the longest at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">860</NUMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">XI-I</ENAMEX> has the
          highest average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX> nucleotides. It contains the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">860</NUMEX>-nucleotide intron and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others that are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. In a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">998</NUMEX> introns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.3%</NUMEX> of the
          introns were longer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nucleotides with sizes
          ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59 to 1242</TIMEX> nucleotides [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>]. This makes At
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>-I unusual in having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 introns</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>)
          longer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nucleotides. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> had
          an intron over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nucleotides. Of the total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">557</NUMEX> splice
          sites that were identified in the 
          Arabidopsis myosins <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> (a
          little <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 1%</NUMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 500</NUMEX> nucleotides with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> being in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> myosin. Hunt 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> found that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> small-t
          intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 66</NUMEX> nucleotides in length was spliced
          efficiently in tobacco cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>]. Several of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in the myosins are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 66 and 70</NUMEX> nucleotides
          and so may be long enough to be spliced. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> is in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cloned myosin</ENAMEX> known to be spliced at that site (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIJ</ENAMEX>).
          There is also a predicted intron of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 47</NUMEX> nucleotides
          in length (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XID</ENAMEX>) which is thought to be too short for
          efficient splicing. Brown 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>] found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> introns
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> nucleotides in length in known expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but none of them was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 59</NUMEX> nucleotides.
          Until the expression of At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XID</ENAMEX> is studied, no conclusion
          can be made as to the validity of this intron prediction.
          The significance of the range and variability of intron
          length is not known. In 
          Arabidopsis, in general, the range
          is even greater (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,442</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].

        Discussion
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> classes of myosins are present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. A study of myosins in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lily</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco pollen</ENAMEX> tubes using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        animal-type myosins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> suggested the
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of myosins in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        However, no type <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> have been found in any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> types (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XI</ENAMEX>) have been
        identified. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Class XI</ENAMEX> are somewhat similar to class V
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] and this may explain the reaction with the
        type V <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Possibly the other reactions were due to
        similarities in the myosin motor domain. Phylogenetic
        analysis of 
        Arabidopsis myosins along with other
        plant myosins suggests that most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> (except
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>) fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The 
        Arabidopsis myosins have anywhere
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to six</NUMEX> IQ domains. The IQ domain in non-plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> has been shown to bind to calmodulin in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium-independent</ENAMEX> manner. The regulation of myosin action
        is thought to be due to calmodulin interaction. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> have been shown to associate with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 67</TIMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin-containing protein</ENAMEX> fraction
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco BY2 cells</ENAMEX> was used in motility assays with
        F-actin. Concentrations of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -6M</TIMEX> caused a
        significant reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin sliding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Another
        study with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lily pollen</ENAMEX>, also
        demonstrated a co-precipitation of myosin and calmodulin
        and a similar effect of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. Not only
        did concentrations above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -6M cause inhibition of myosin
        activity, but the effects of concentrations higher than 10
        -5M were not reversible upon Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+removal. These studies
        provide evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins bind calmodulin in the
        absence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and are active when calmodulin is bound and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated</ENAMEX> when the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration is increased. They
        also found that when the myosin fraction was pretreated
        with CaCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX> did not bind the myosin,
        suggesting that calmodulin dissociates from myosin at high
        concentrations of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. The myosins in the above studies
        have not been cloned, and binding to specific IQ domains
        has not been established. However, the presence of IQ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosins
        suggests that these are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+regulation. It
        would be interesting to investigate the possible
        phosphorylation of the threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> which is three
        residues upstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEDS</ENAMEX> rule site in class XI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> and to see if enzyme activity is regulated by
        phosphorylation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>.
        Myosins are involved in a wide range of cellular
        functions. They have been shown to be involved in movement,
        translocation, cell division, organelle transport,
        G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-linked signal cascade and maintenance of
        structure within cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insight</ENAMEX> into the function of
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">myosins</ENAMEX> has been gained by studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>.
        Cytoplasmic streaming is responsible for movement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelles</ENAMEX> and vesicles and of generative cells and
        vegetative nuclei in pollen tubes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiological</ENAMEX> studies in
        
        Chara have shown that an increase in
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration causes cytoplasmic streaming to stop [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> isolated from the alga 
        Chara corallina was shown to be
        responsible for cytoplasmic streaming [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 69, 70</TIMEX>]. The
        myosin was cloned and characterized and found to be a class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XI</ENAMEX> myosin related to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MYA myosins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have also been shown to be involved in
        cytoplasmic streaming. Using immunofluorescence, myosin was
        localized to vesicles, organelles and generative cells and
        vegetative nuclei in grass pollen tubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. A myosin
        isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lily pollen</ENAMEX> has been shown to be responsible
        for cytoplasmic streaming in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen tubes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> myosins
        were identified in tobacco cell cultures that are also
        thought to participate in cytoplasmic streaming [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 71</TIMEX>].
        Antibodies to the myosins recognized a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
        vegetative cells as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen tubes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] suggest that class XI
        myosins are likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for transport of large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> because of the number of IQ domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-6</ENAMEX>).
        Previous studies showed that translocational step size
        produced by a myosin motor is proportional to the number of
        IQ domains and the larger the step the faster or more
        efficiently they are able to transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        However, the kinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the motor domain are
        also involved in speed and there is a wide range of
        movement speeds for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 72, 73</ENAMEX>].
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> specific to a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.</ENAMEX> mays <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosin</ENAMEX> was used to
        localize this myosin in fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize proteins</ENAMEX> and
        maize root tip cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. The nuclear/cell wall fraction
        and the plastid fraction contained relatively small amounts
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> while the mitochondrial fraction and the low
        density membrane fraction had most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. The root
        tip cells showed particulate staining in the cytoplasm, but
        neither the vacuole membrane nor plasma membrane were
        stained, although in some cells the staining was too bright
        to distinguish if the plasma membrane was stained or not.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI myosins</ENAMEX> in 
        Arabidopsis that could be involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicle</ENAMEX> and organelle transport. The large number could
        reflect redundancy of function or differential expression.
        Patterns of expression were different for the cloned 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. mays</ENAMEX> and 
        Arabidopsis myosins that have been
        analyzed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 51</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunolocalization</ENAMEX> studies have also detected myosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with plasmodesmata. Plasmodesmata are
        interconnections between contiguous plant cells that allow
        direct cell-to-cell transport of ions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A
        recent study using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to a cloned class VIII 
        Arabidopsis myosin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATM1</TIMEX> (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX>)
        localized this myosin to the plasmodesmata and the plasma
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of new cell walls
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. Earlier work suggested that actin was involved in
        regulation of plasmodesmal transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>]. Other studies
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to animal myosins in root tissues of 
        Allium cepa, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. mays</ENAMEX> and 
        Hordeum vulagare have also indicated
        the presence of myosin in the plasmodesmata [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunolocalization</ENAMEX> studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> need to be interpreted with caution as there are no
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosins</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with animal myosins.
        The recent work by Reichelt 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] is more convincing
        because they used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to plant myosin. The myosin was
        localized mainly to the transverse walls with some punctate
        labeling of the longitudinal walls. During cell division
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti</ENAMEX>-class-VIII myosin staining remains confined to the
        transverse cell walls and is strongest in the newly formed
        cell wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunogold electron</ENAMEX> microscopy showed labeling
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class VIII</ENAMEX> myosin associated with the plasma membrane
        and plasmodesmata. These studies suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII
        myosins may be involved in new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> formation and
        transport in the plasmodesmata. Reichelt 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] suggest that myosin VIII
        could act to bring islands of membrane plate material
        together or could trigger exocytosis of new cell wall
        material, or alternatively as an anchor for actin along the
        transverse walls. The role of myosin in the plasmodesmata
        was studied further by pretreating tissue with
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,3-butanedione 2-moxoxime</NUMEX> (BDM), an inhibitor of
        actin-myosin motility. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pretreatment</ENAMEX> resulted in a
        strong constriction of the neck region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmodesmata</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosin VIII</ENAMEX> in the plasmodesmata could be a part of a
        gating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that is thought to control the opening of
        the plasmodesma neck [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> VIII
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosins</ENAMEX> in 
        Arabidopsis that could be involved in
        these types of functions.
        A recent study of the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> on the distribution
        of myosins, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin, microtubules and cortical endoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) suggests that myosins may link together
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubules</ENAMEX> and actin filaments involved in structural
        interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>]. This study used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to myosin II
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and 
        Arabidopsis myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment disrupted normal
        cellular distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize myosins</ENAMEX> and the
        characteristic distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">actin</ENAMEX> was also affected.
        Myosin may participate in the intracellular distribution of
        actin filaments as was proposed for myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX>].
        Microtubule arrangements in cortical root cells were
        altered, as was the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Post-mitotic cell
        growth was inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>, specifically in the transition
        zone and the apical parts of the elongation region. The
        study suggested that actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and microtubules interact
        together via myosins and that myosin-based contractility of
        the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the developmental
        progression of root cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>]. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has only been
        shown to inhibit a few myosins 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>] and is known to be a
        nonspecific inhibitor; so these results must be viewed with
        caution.
      
      
        Conclusions
        As the classification system of myosins now stands,
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> fall only into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes - <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class VIII</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class XI</ENAMEX>. All animal cells examined contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and usually multiple myosin I genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>],
        but this is not true for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> specifically and possibly
        for all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Also, no animal myosins of type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VIII</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XI</ENAMEX>
        have been identified. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Plant</ENAMEX> and animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> have some
        common tasks such as vesicular and organelle movement, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant cells</ENAMEX> are unique in many ways and the presence of
        specific plant myosins is probably a reflection of that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uniqueness</ENAMEX>.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class VIII</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> class XI 
        Arabidopsis myosins. The large number
        of myosins in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class XI</ENAMEX> could be the result of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> or specialization of function in different
        tissues or different life cycle times. This work identifies
        the 
        Arabidopsis myosins, their domains
        and gene intron/exon structure. The task ahead is to
        analyze the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products biochemically</ENAMEX> and try to
        establish the function of each myosin.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        Using the conserved motor domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> myosin At
        MYA1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] database searches were performed using BLASTP
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The sequences were evaluated for
        the presence of a myosin motor domain using the SMART
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. All sequences with a myosin domain had
        BLASTP scores greater than 100 and E values less than 10
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. The motor domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> myosins from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were also used to search the 
        Arabidopsis domain but the searches
        did not reveal any new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin genes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMART program</ENAMEX> also
        identified the IQ and coiled-coil domains and the location
        of the domains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> were checked
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> identified at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> as myosins but not at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> were evaluated as above.
        The sizes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX>/introns were determined using the
        exon/intron data for each myosin sequence using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>
        predictions for myosins not previously cloned. Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIF</ENAMEX>, At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIH</ENAMEX>) were edited by comparing the
        upstream genome sequence translation to conserved sequences
        present in the other myosins but missing in the predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
        Sequences of myosins other than the 
        Arabidopsis myosins for phylogenetic
        analysis were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] or NCBI [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. The
        names are as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodge</ENAMEX> and Cope [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. The motor
        domain sequences were determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMART</ENAMEX> program [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>]. The motor domain sequences were used for alignment of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and non-plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">myosins</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megalign</ENAMEX> program.
        The alignment was saved as a PAUP file and the phylogenetic
        analysis was done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b4a</ENAMEX> (PPC). We performed a
        bootstrap analysis with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> replicates using the heuristic
        method. Full-length sequences were used for analysis of the
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">myosins</ENAMEX> using the same methods as above.
