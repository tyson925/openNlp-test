        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> is a chronic disorder that has been
        recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as a major public
        health problem with far reaching consequences not just for
        its adverse impact on the health of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, but also for
        the economic burden it places on the health care system. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the seriousness of the problem, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX>
        million dollars has been set aside to fund the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes Strategy</ENAMEX> - a comprehensive national plan focusing
        on the prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> through health promotion and
        education [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Targeting diabetes</ENAMEX> in this way is not
        surprising as it has been estimated that over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> are known to be afflicted with this condition,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> having type 2 diabetes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, it is
        acknowledged that this is likely an underestimation of the
        scope of the disease as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
        do not know they have it [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        The clinical consequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> can be life
        threatening and disabling. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX> is ranked as the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> leading cause of death in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> with at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,500</NUMEX> deaths per year attributed directly to the condition
        itself; however, this number rises dramatically to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25,000</NUMEX> when deaths from diabetic
        complications are included [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Coronary heart disease
        is the leading cause of death in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] .
        There is an established connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and
        both macrovascular and microvascular complications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX>
        ] . It has been reported that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of all
        cardiac surgery can be attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. It is also
        the leading cause of both end-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX> (ESRD)
        and non-traumatic lower extremity amputations (LEAs) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32% and 50%</NUMEX> of new cases,
        respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four hundred</NUMEX> new cases of blindness
        can be attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> each year, making diabetes
        the leading cause of new blindness in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] . Many of the complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> are particularly
        debilitating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, accompanied not only by a
        personal physical and emotional burden, but a significant
        economic one for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> as
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX> and the health care system in particular. Health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> has reported that twice as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> of working age reported disability days in a set
        period than their non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic contemporaries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the economic burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> was
        estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.1 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It has been
        acknowledged that this is a gross underestimation as costs
        related to the complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> were not included
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> projection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9 billion</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>,
        which included both direct and indirect costs was
        established [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This estimate was derived, however,
        based on published studies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>) and
        by making adjustments for differences in population sizes
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for this
        estimate, it could be argued that it does not accurately
        reflect the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Yet, it is not
        uncommon to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>-based proxy costs in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> reports,
        as there is a marked lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-specific cost
        information relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and its complications in
        the literature.
        Given the recent initiatives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> government
        to target <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> at a national level, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and its
        complications are clearly an ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>. To make informed decisions about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>-related care and new therapeutic interventions,
        such as emerging oral hypoglycemics, these decision makers
        need to have <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-specific cost information. Moreover,
        to ensure an accurate picture of the cost of managing
        diabetes the typical broad cost estimates are not useful
        because they do not distinguish among determinants of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use and their time course and thus cannot help
        sort out the implications of changes in policy. For
        example, if a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is more expensive but reduces the
        frequency of hyperglycemia then its economic assessment
        must address costs at a more detailed level. Building on
        our previously published work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> costs of
        major macrovascular complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to provide key pieces of that complex
        economic puzzle. This paper presents updated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-specific cost information for macrovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX> and new information on microvascular
        complications. The complications included in the analysis
        were chosen based on those considered in published
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> and economic models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are presented in a comprehensive manner so that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> can examine the cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for each
        complication.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cost Sources
          As no one data source was available from which to
          abstract resource use and cost-relevant data for this
          analysis, it was necessary to gather information from a
          variety of pertinent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Acute inpatient resource
          use and costs were derived primarily from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-95</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-96</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Case Cost Project</ENAMEX> (OCCP) databases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> is a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Ministry of</ENAMEX>
          Health and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Hospital Association</ENAMEX>. It was
          initiated for the purpose of developing information based
          on case cost data for funding and hospital management
          purposes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with the analysis-relevant
          complications were identified by a principal diagnosis
          code (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diseases</ENAMEX> (ICD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) codes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Where possible, only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a secondary diagnosis code of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> were
          included in the analysis. For example, diabetic patients
          admitted primarily for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> were identified by a principal
          diagnosis code of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICD-9</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410.9</NUMEX>) and a
          secondary diagnosis code documenting diabetes
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250.00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250.93</NUMEX>). When the number of diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a specific complication was insufficient to
          perform a reliable analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was expanded
          to include non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic patients</ENAMEX> with that complication,
          as the focus of the analysis was to develop the cost of
          managing the complication and not <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Additional
          cost-related information based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Case Mix</ENAMEX> Groupings
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMGs</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] was also reviewed and used when
          necessary to supplement the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ICD9</NUMEX>-based data. Acute care
          hospital cost estimates include, all accommodation (e.g.,
          routine and special care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>), ancillary services
          (e.g., pharmacy, laboratory), emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, operating
          room, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and
          physician costs. As physician costs are not included in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data nor reported in the literature in
          sufficient detail, it was necessary to develop the
          corresponding resource use profiles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data and
          the medical literature were used to develop these based
          on length of stay (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>), physician service data, and the
          use of resource intensive services such as the emergency
          room, surgical procedures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX>, special care
          units, and consultations.
          Recognizing the need for continuation of health care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> upon discharge, post-acute care resource use
          profiles were developed. To develop these profiles, data
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> on disposition at discharge were supplemented
          with information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alberta Ambulatory Care Costing</ENAMEX>
          project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Diabetes Association</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Disease and Stroke Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Canada</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> clinical
          practice guidelines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] , other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
          institutional reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] , provider
          survey data on day care and cardiac rehabilitation, and
          peer-reviewed literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . In order to
          maintain consistency with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>
          provincial fee schedules and formulary [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] were
          used as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-related care,
          laboratory tests, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. Additional references
          used for specific complications are noted within the
          appropriate sections of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
          Reimbursement for health care in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is largely
          provincial rather than federal; therefore in order to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">derive</ENAMEX> "national" costs, it was necessary to adjust
          provincial data. Published health and personal care data
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] were used to derive a ratio
          between provincial and national healthcare costs by cost
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> costs were then
          adjusted using these ratios to derive the national
          equivalent.
          There are several modalities of treatment for ESRD
          (e.g., hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal
          transplant). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> costs of caring for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on each
          of these were applied to the proportion of patients
          receiving that type of treatment to give a weighted
          average cost. While the distribution was taken from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, it was assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is in a
          steady state - that is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> leaving the ESRD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> entering the ESRD population
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given year</TIMEX> have approximately the same modality
          distribution such that the overall distribution does not
          vary significantly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>. The distribution of
          treatment modalities for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> ESRD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Institute for</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Information</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45</NUMEX> ] . There is a definite and
          discernable event cost for renal transplant versus the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> cost of managing someone who has had a renal
          transplant. Thus, to estimate the steady-state cost for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX>, it was necessary to also estimate the costs of
          renal transplantation. This was achieved by applying the
          event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> cost of a transplant to the proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had received a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal transplant</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
          (transplant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>) and combining that with the annual
          management cost applied to the proportion receiving a
          transplant during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a previous year</TIMEX>. The average annual
          costs of caring for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> during the transplant year
          and in a subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> were obtained from the
          literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . The average annual cost of treatment
          for hemodialysis and that for peritoneal dialysis were
          taken from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> report published by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agence d'√</ENAMEX>©valuation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des technologies et</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">des modes d'intervention</ENAMEX> en sant√© (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A√âTMIS</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . These costs were updated to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2000</TIMEX> and
          "nationalized" according to the methodology described
          above.
          The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost and resource use data
          used in this analysis were derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
          For rare exceptions pertaining to post-acute care, it was
          necessary to rely on resource use data from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. For example, no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data were available for
          post-acute care following discharge from coronary artery
          bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angioplasty</ENAMEX> (PTCA) readmissions in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
          had a previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX>. Thus, it was necessary to employ
          diagnosis-specific disposition distributions for a
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five 1996/97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> to derive initial post-acute care patterns. The
          proportions were then adjusted to reflect the difference
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> case fatality rates for diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX>. Also, although initial discharge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disposition</ENAMEX> data from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> were used in the analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data detailing transitions to other levels of
          care over time for those with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disabling strokes</ENAMEX> were not
          available; therefore we used our stroke economic model [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> ] to derive the state costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. The long-term
          transition data used in this model come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>
          ] .
          Only direct medical costs, those directly related to
          delivery of the health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, are included in the
          estimates reported here. All event and state cost
          estimates are reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> dollars. Where
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> values were not available, older estimates were
          inflated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care</ENAMEX> Inflation Index, a
          component of the Consumer Price Index, supplied by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .

            It was assumed that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> were
            treated initially as inpatients. The acute care portion
            of the event cost is comprised of acute hospitalization
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,739</NUMEX>), including physician costs for the initial

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring this type of transport to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. Subsequent (post-acute) care for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> includes
            outpatient medical care, surgical follow-up care
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-CABG</ENAMEX>, home health care, cardiac rehabilitation,
            long term facility care, and readmissions within the
            event year for a subsequent myocardia infarction (MI),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CABG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCA</ENAMEX> or coronary angiography. The subsequent care
            cost was developed by weighting the cost of these
            health care services by the proportion of patients
            using these services to derive the average cost per
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. In other words, only those who had a CABG
            during their stay would have the surgical follow-up
            care included in their cost profile. The event year
            cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18,635</NUMEX>.
            State costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> were calculated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,193</NUMEX>, per
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, per year on average. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
            (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, beta blockers,

            reductase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>) weighted by the proportion of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiology</ENAMEX> tests (i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG) and

            experienced an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</NUMEX>) required long-term care
            facility placement according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data. The cost of
            this care is also reflected in the state cost. In
            addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> listed previously, several
            additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> were used to obtain information

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Angina</ENAMEX>
            On average, the event cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,183</NUMEX>, per
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. This includes proportionately weighted
            estimates for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX>: unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalized</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,661</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> treated in emergency room

            care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,230</NUMEX>). In the absence of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-specific data, the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> stable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
            unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] , and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>
            proportion of unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated as inpatients
            were obtained from the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data
            revealed that of those admitted with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> were
            transported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>. Subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> costs
            include the same cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> as for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> except that no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of a nursing home as a
            result. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> resource
            use profile include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, beta
            blockers, nitrates, angiotensin converting inhibitors
            and statins. The costs for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were weighted
            based on reported proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using
            them [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 59 63</NUMEX> ] .
            State costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> were calculated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,485</NUMEX>,
            per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, per year on average. These included
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX>, physician visits, laboratory tests and
            monitoring cardiology tests (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> and stress
            test). Additional resource use information regarding
            visits and tests was abstracted from published sources
            [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 64 65</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischemic Stroke</ENAMEX>
            The disabling consequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> are reflected
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> management costs, as more patients
            require continuing care services after discharge from
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data and information from published
            literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 67 68 69 70 71</NUMEX> ] were used to determine
            post-acute care placement for rehabilitation,
            readmission for a subsequent stroke events and long
            term care in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX>. Acute care comprises only
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,822</NUMEX>) of the mean event cost for ischemic stroke
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$33,256</NUMEX>). This is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX> proportion (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>),
            highlighting the effect of increased need for
            post-acute care in stroke.
            The mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> state cost is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,769</NUMEX> and reflects
            outpatient monitoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>) and
            the increased need for day care, durable medical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> and permanent long-term care in this patient
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            TIA
            It was assumed for this analysis that all patients
            diagnosed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIA</ENAMEX> who are diabetic would receive
            inpatient care initially. It was also assumed that all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIAs</ENAMEX> are truly transient - an assumption that finds
            some support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP TIA</ENAMEX> data where the only
            post-acute discharge dispositions were home (outpatient
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>), home health care and rehabilitation. Thus, no
            health care services associated with permanent residual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disability</ENAMEX> (e.g., long term care placement) were
            considered for inclusion in the cost estimate.
            Additional resource use data were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> ] . The mean event cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIA</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,262</NUMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspirin</ENAMEX> is the only medication included in the cost
            profiles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIA</ENAMEX>. Thus, the mean state cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$73</NUMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIA</ENAMEX> is based on monitoring visits to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microvascular Complications</ENAMEX>
          
            Nephropathy
            The costs for microalbuminuria and gross proteinuria
            are based primarily on recommendations from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
            clinical practice guidelines and consist only of
            laboratory tests on urine and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> visits. The use
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE Inhibitors</ENAMEX> is discussed in the literature with
            regard to the prevention of progression of renal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> clinical practice recommendations
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> recognize that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who have proteinuria may benefit from this
            type of therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE Inhibitors</ENAMEX>
            should be considered, but do not recommend them for all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. As no data are available pertaining to the
            proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on this type of therapy solely
            for the purpose of preventing further renal
            deterioration, the cost is not included in the current
            estimate. The event cost for microalbuminuria is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$62</NUMEX>;
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$54</NUMEX> for gross proteinuria. The state costs are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18</NUMEX> for microalbuminuria and gross proteinuria,
            respectively.
            The annual cost (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$63,045</NUMEX>) of caring for a patient
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> represents a weighted average of the annual
            costs for hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal
            transplant.
          
          
            Retinopathy
            The costs for macular edema and proliferative
            retinopathy are comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> visits,
            ophthalmology consults, and the use of diagnostic and
            therapeutic eye procedures (i.e., color fundus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photography</ENAMEX>, fluorescein angiography and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photocoagulation</ENAMEX>). Published <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> clinical practice
            guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX> were the source for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . The mean event costs for these
            complications are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$423</NUMEX> for macular edema and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$379</NUMEX> for
            proliferative retinopathy, respectively when
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photocoagulation</ENAMEX> is used. If both conditions are
            present in one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the event cost rises to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$495</NUMEX>.
            The state cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40</NUMEX>, comprised of additional
            monitoring by an ophthalmologist, is the same for both
            conditions.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blindness</ENAMEX> does not have an event cost, as there is
            no event per se. Rather, the decent into blindness due
            to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is the result of either failure to detect
            or failure to treat retinopathy at an earlier stage.
            Unfortunately, there has been little information
            developed on the annual cost of blindness, let alone
            the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> direct medical cost in any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. No
            information could be found from the literature,
            government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or relevant private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that
            deal with the blind. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the only available sources
            for direct medical costs is a published <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>-based cost
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1990</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] . By converting this figure to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> dollars using the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> exchange rate of
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.8572</NUMEX> and then inflating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> value to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> dollar values a state cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,111</NUMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blindness</ENAMEX> was estimated.
          
          
            Neuropathy
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three</TIMEX> levels of neuropathy were examined in this
            analysis: symptomatic neuropathy, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and second
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX>. The resource use for symptomatic neuropathy was
            limited to diagnosis and monitoring, as there is no
            specific treatment for this condition, and use of the
            palliative options available is not consistent. Thus,
            this is likely an underestimation of the cost for this
            complication. Published clinical practice guidelines
            were used to establish the event year resource use
            profile [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 74</NUMEX> ] . The event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> cost is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$148</NUMEX> per
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. There is no state cost as beyond the initial
            diagnostic tests, there is no further management
            recommended.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuropathy</ENAMEX> and foot <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> can lead to amputations.
            These can occur at various levels: toe, foot, below the
            knee and above the knee. Thus, the cost for each type
            of amputation was calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data and then
            weighted by the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> having
            that type of surgery to determine the overall event
            cost for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, it has been reported that
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> will go on
            to have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LEA within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] ; therefore,
            event costs for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amputation were
            calculated separately. As it is not possible to discern
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LEA in a claims database,
            proportions by type of amputation were used to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">differentiate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between first</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amputation
            inpatient costs. No <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data were available to
            make this differentiation possible at all of the
            necessary levels required for this analysis; therefore,
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> based study from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX> was used to provide
            proportions of amputation type for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LEA
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . The cost of an above the knee amputation (AKA)
            is considerably more than that of a toe amputation, not
            just in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19,760</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6,460</NUMEX>) but also
            beyond due to the significantly higher level of
            disability resulting from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKA</ENAMEX>. Information regarding
            post-acute care dispositions, rehabilitation,
            readmissions for debridement and major stump revisions,
            and use of prosthetic devises and durable medical
            equipment were obtained from the OCCP database,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provider</ENAMEX> surveys and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 78 79</NUMEX> ] . The
            increase in event cost from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24,583</NUMEX>) to second
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$26,077</NUMEX>) represents a shift to a higher anatomical,
            and thus, more costly level of amputation for the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amputation as noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>
            ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> can be a very disabling event for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and
            has consequences beyond the event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. No published
            information was identified that could isolate ongoing
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> direct management costs related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> versus
            usual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, thus, only
            costs directly related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> (i.e., long-term
            facility residential care and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, refitting
            of the prosthetic device) are included in the state
            cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX>. The state cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LEA 1</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,020</NUMEX>. To
            avoid double-counting, given the cost components of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LEA</ENAMEX> state profile, the state cost of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LEA is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conservatively</ENAMEX> assumed to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> as it was not
            possible to discern which prosthesis related costs
            would be specific to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> prosthesis versus costs
            already included in the state cost for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LEA1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 80 81</NUMEX>

            For the purpose of this analysis, foot <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> are
            defined as those that heal without amputation or
            vascular surgery. Since not all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic foot ulcers</ENAMEX>
            are treated in an inpatient setting, the event cost is
            a weighted average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7,802</NUMEX>) and outpatient
            care costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,042</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data and information from the
            literature were used to determine proportions and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 83 84 85</NUMEX> ] . The event cost for
            diabetic foot ulcer is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,183</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, on average.
            There is no state cost calculated for this complication
            as it is considered to be episodic.
          
          
            Hypoglycemia
            For the purpose of this analysis, only hypoglycemic
            events that generate the use of medication or formal
            health care services (formal care) were included. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
            levels of resource use were considered for this
            condition: the lowest level of formal care is
            self-treatment with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucagon</ENAMEX> injection and no
            intervention from medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX>); the middle
            level is an ambulatory care or emergency room
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consultation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$194</NUMEX>); the highest level is
            hospitalization with a follow-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> visit
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,184</NUMEX>). A cost was developed for each level. An
            overall hypoglycemic event cost was derived by applying
            the appropriate weights, taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> studies, as no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data were available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86 87</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 1%</NUMEX> of
            those experiencing a hypoglycemic event are assigned
            inpatient costs. The event cost for this episodic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$111</NUMEX>.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX> and its complications are major health care
        problems for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 6%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> population
        is affected and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Nations</ENAMEX> have one of the highest
        reported prevalences (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>) in an indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>
        ] . It has been recognized that health care expenditures
        related to the complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> account for a
        substantial proportion of the public health care budget [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> ] and that related costs are likely to escalate as the
        population ages. Yet, given the size of the problem, the
        acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and initiatives undertaken to address
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> on a national level and for the native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in particular, it is surprising that there is so
        little available <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> information about the cost of the
        complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, particularly at a level detailed
        enough to be meaningful to decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> or those doing
        economic analyses. The purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to provide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> cost estimates for several common
        complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in a manner that can be useful to
        interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.
        A main goal of this analysis was to develop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-specific cost estimates using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost
        and resource use information wherever possible. This point
        is stressed as the importance of using country-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in an economic analysis cannot be ignored. As noted
        earlier, it is not uncommon to find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> costs
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> used as a proxy for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> costs, even in
        official reports [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ; however, the true relevance of
        these costs to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> can only be assumed.
        In previously published work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , we have shown that
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> data, even when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> costs are used
        can lead to inaccurate, albeit well-intentioned estimates.
        In that example, a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $1,400</NUMEX>
        dollars in the state cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> was noted when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> use data were replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data. As the
        state cost is applied to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is in that
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, a substantial miscalculation of the lifetime
        cost attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> would have been produced, even
        though it would have been based on the best available data
        and accepted as a reasonable proxy in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data.
        Although there may be clinical consensus on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of a condition, type and availability of health
        care services, medical practice patterns, and access to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> will affect the type and level of care actually
        delivered. Thus, differences beyond those relating to just
        monetary conditions must be acknowledged when using proxy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, as sometimes their use is unavoidable. While every
        effort was made to use only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-based data in this
        analysis, it was not possible in some cases (e.g., aspects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMI</ENAMEX>). Does that mean that those estimates
        relying on some data from elsewhere should be ignored? We
        would argue "no" even in the face of the cautionary words
        provided above. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> costs used in this analysis are
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and the vast majority of resource use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are also <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>. The estimates provided here are the
        closest reflection possible of the costs for these
        complications in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> given the data available at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of the analysis. They can and should be used, but with
        an understanding that for the few estimates where proxy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> have been employed, the cost may not be a precise
        estimate for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.
        Apart from the use of proxy data, some of the
        complication costs may be overestimated or underestimated
        due to the content of the resource use profile. For
        example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIA</ENAMEX> estimate may be an overestimation of the
        event cost if a substantial number of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are not
        treated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> initially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. If the TIA
        profile were to include a large proportion of patients
        treated initially as outpatients, the event cost for TIA
        could be decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 45%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 90</NUMEX> ] . It is
        likely that the foot ulcer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEA</ENAMEX> and symptomatic neuropathy
        estimates are underestimated as data for some potentially
        relevant cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> were not available. The degree of
        uncertainty in these estimates cannot be quantified because
        in most cases the source data do not provide it and there
        are reasons other than statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">imprecision</ENAMEX> that may
        also contribute.
        The use of administrative databases, as in this
        analysis, brings with it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> regarding the accuracy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICD-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">coding</ENAMEX>. Published coding error rates relating to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> could not be identified. While a study
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX> showed that there was
        under-coding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in hospital records [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> ] , later
        studies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> have reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX>
        accuracy rate in coding of major macrovascular
        complications in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92</TIMEX> ] . The coding
        error rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCCP</ENAMEX> data is unknown, but for the purpose
        of this analysis, it is only of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> if there is a
        cost-relevant bias in the cases included. It is unclear
        whether such a bias exists. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ideal</ENAMEX> circumstances would allow
        for the development of cost estimates based on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> study, designed not to influence resource
        use, of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unselected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with sufficient follow-up.
        Unfortunately, that ideal rarely exists. This cost estimate
        created by assembling existing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> data provides
        health care decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, who cannot wait for
        the ideal data to accumulate, key information heretofore
        unavailable.
      
      
        Conclusion
        While health care promotion and education are valuable
        tools in the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the condition and its
        complications will continue to have a profound impact on
        the health of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, as well as provincial and national
        health care budgets for the foreseeable future. New
        treatments are being developed to improve glycemic control
        in those with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> with the goal of preventing or
        delaying some of the devastating complications associated
        with the disease. While appropriate medical care of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> should be the prevailing factor for all health care
        decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, whether at the care delivery or the policy
        level, economic factors cannot be ignored. In order to
        determine which therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are appropriate for use,
        cost-effectiveness, as well as efficacy and safety should
        be weighed. The estimates in this analysis do not provide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cost-effectiveness</ENAMEX> information for any type of treatment
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, but we believe that they do provide valuable
        cost inputs for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> or policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> who needs
        such information to carry out an economic analysis.
