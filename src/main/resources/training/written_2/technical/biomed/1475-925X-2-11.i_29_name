        Today, the use of mobile phones is widespread and the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> is increasing rapidly. It is generally
        known that an electromagnetic field of adequate intensity
        and frequency may interfere with implanted devices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobile</ENAMEX>
        phones are regarded as a potential source of
        electromagnetic interference with pacemakers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] - [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">defibrillators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 19 20</ENAMEX> ] . An extensive review of the
        literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] demonstrated that up to now no
        examinations on electromagnetic compatibility aspects of
        deep brain stimulators (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX>) and mobile phones have been
        published. The malfunctions (inhibition, switch to the
        safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modus</ENAMEX>, i.e. stimulation with a fixed rate, and
        stimulation with a false signal) reported with pacemakers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] - [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] due to the use of mobile phones may lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discomfort</ENAMEX> and in rare cases to menacing situations for the
        pacemaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. These malfunctions depend on various
        parameters: frequency, transmitting power, modulation
        principle of the mobile phone system, distance between
        mobile phone and pacemaker, implantation depth, operating
        mode of the pacemaker as well as the interference immunity
        of the pacemaker. For older pacemakers a safety distance of
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 inches</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 centimeters</NUMEX>) is sufficient to avoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malfunctions</ENAMEX>, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> recommend less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 inches</NUMEX>. The use of the mobile phone on the opposite
        side of the pacemaker's location reduces the probability of
        interference. Subsequently, pacemaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should not
        carry the mobile phone in the breast pocket close to the
        pacemaker or, if the pacemaker is located in the abdomen,
        not on a belt, when it is switched on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defibrillators</ENAMEX> seem
        to be less sensitive than pacemakers regarding
        electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones. Generally,
        the same precautions (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 inches or 15 centimeter</NUMEX> minimum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>) as in the case of pacemakers should be
        encouraged. If these precautions are adhered to the
        possibility of interference with defibrillators can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minimized</ENAMEX>.
        The increasing use of neurostimulators and mobile
        phones, and the lack of information on possible disturbance
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBSs</ENAMEX> due to exposure from mobile phones motivated us to
        carry out this study. We studied the interference of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS ITREL-III</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medtronic Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> mobile phones operating at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz
        and with broadband diploes in the frequency range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHZ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 2400</TIMEX> MHz. Unlike pacemakers and defibrillators,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBSs</ENAMEX> have no sensing inputs and therefore they should be
        more robust regarding electromagnetic interference.
        However, stimulation leads could act as antenna, picking up
        radio frequency (RF) currents and leading them into the
        device. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Feed</ENAMEX> through filters should be able to handle this
        problem. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> did not disclose
        information of the implant design, the electronic circuit
        design, whether feed though filters where used or not and
        which other electromagnetic compatibility precautions were
        taken.
        Neurological pulse generators are used as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBSs</ENAMEX> in the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> or as spinal cord
        stimulators. This study deals only with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX>. Located in the chest region under the skin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX>
        stimulates certain areas of the brain, namely the thalamus
        or subthalamus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Due to its superior programming
        possibilities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III and ITREL-II</ENAMEX> are the DBSs
        preferred by our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for neurosurgery. A programming
        device can telemetrically adjust the stimulation parameters
        such as frequency, amplitude, and pulse duration. Two
        critical locations of the phone in respect of interference
        that correspond to typical use scenarios can be found: The
        region around the ear due to the closeness of the mobile
        phone antenna to the leads of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX> and the breast region
        due to the potential closeness of the mobile phone to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Tests of commercially available mobile
          phones
          The electromagnetic compatibility behavior of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> was examined while exposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> to
          the fields of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GSM 900</ENAMEX> MHz mobile
          phones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different GSM <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz mobile phones. Every
          mobile phone was tested in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different positions next
          to the phantom, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different electrode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configurations</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different stimulation parameters,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeeFF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Altogether, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">960</NUMEX> different test
          configurations were examined. The power control of the
          handsets was adjusted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">MHz</ENAMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> tester "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">CMD 55</ENAMEX>" from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwarz</ENAMEX>. The maximum
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">radiated</TIMEX> peak power was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/- 2 dB</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/- 2 dB</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz, respectively.
          Different spatial configurations of the implant
          lead-shape and lead-size, can affect the interference due
          to different RF-behavior. Particularly, loops in the
          leads are able to pick up more RF currents. With respect
          to RF-behavior two significantly different lead
          configurations were chosen: the "loop" and the "meander."
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different lead configurations for
          interference testing.
          All mobile phones were tested in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> next
          to the phantom: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. in front of the chest - directly over
          the implant with the mobile phone touching the phantom;
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. next to the ear - in a typical position while
          making a telephone call. This position is defined in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          ] as the "cheek" or "touch" position; shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. in a non-typical position in front of the skull
          directly over the loop or meander; shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
          To observe the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> the output
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> at the connection of the lead to the implant case
          was monitored via a shielded cable on an oscilloscope.
          Interference with the field of the mobile phone and the
          monitoring cable was prevented by routing the monitoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable</ENAMEX> out of the phantom to the oscilloscope on the
          opposite side (back of the phantom) of the interference
          source.
          Different mobile phones have different types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antennas</ENAMEX> and each antenna has its own current
          distribution. The current distribution on the antenna and
          the antenna location on the mobile phone case affects the
          field distribution in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and therefore the
          interference behavior. Another major difference between
          mobile phones is the emitted peak power due to the GSM
          specifications which allow a peak power tolerance of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 dB.</TIMEX> To get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> coverage we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          different GSM mobile phones indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>.
          Ad hoc testing of electronic implants with special
          types of mobile phones only gives reliable results for
          the tested phones. To know the safety margin for possible
          interference it is necessary to perform tests with more
          general interference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Therefore broadband dipoles
          were used to find out which power levels, depending on
          the frequency would cause interference.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susceptibility</ENAMEX> tests using broadband dipoles
          The purpose was to determine the interference level of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> in the frequency range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2400</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>. We used broadband dipoles shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dipole</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> equilateral triangles with a
          length L of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> of the wavelength. We used two
          different broadband dipoles with dimensions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> MHz
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz. Dipoles were mounted on the surface of the
          phantom directly over the implant and driven by an RF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplifier</ENAMEX>. The RF signal was a continuous wave (CW). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dipole</ENAMEX> touched the surface of the phantom and had a
          distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> mm to the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm
          phantom plastic shell and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mm phantom liquid, see
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
          Such a scenario corresponds to the situation when a
          patient carries a mobile phone in his jacket. At each
          examined frequency, the transmitting power of the dipole
          was increased until the implant showed an influence. This
          power level is defined as the interference level. Special
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diligence</ENAMEX> was taken to measure the radiated power
          (forward minus reflected power). Generally, RF
          transmitter frequency tests were performed in frequency
          steps of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>. The frequency increment was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> only in bands where low interference levels were
          observed.
          To estimate the electric field (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> field) inside the
          phantom at the position of the implant we modeled, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz, a simplified test setup using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finite Difference Time Domain</ENAMEX> (FDTD) method with a grid
          size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-wavelength dipole was placed
          directly on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 mm</NUMEX> thick flat plastic layer. Behind the
          flat plastic layer we modeled the liquid phantom material
          with dielectric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Muscle tissue</ENAMEX>" given in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with the resulting E field
          distribution at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz is shown in the results section
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        No influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> was found during tests
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> mobile phones despite a maximum transmission peak
        power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> MHz). No inhibition or
        changes in the shape of the stimulation pulse occurred.
        Tests with broadband dipoles and different power levels
        showed that the output signal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> abruptly
        failed (inhibition) when the interference level was
        exceeded. The inhibition was complete, which means no
        output signal was detected and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> stopped
        working. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> returned to normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> after
        reducing the transmit power below the interference level.
        The primary settings and programming parameters, like the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitude</ENAMEX> and the pulse repetition rate of the output
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> remained unchanged. This kind of
        implant behavior was found at all tested frequencies.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10shows</NUMEX> the frequency dependence of the interference
        level.
        The observed interference level at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 V/m</ENAMEX> inside the liquid at the location of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implant</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> (CW) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m</ENAMEX> inside the liquid at the
        location of the implant at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz. A variation of the
        stimulation parameters does not lead to any essential
        change of the threshold value. The extremely low
        interference level at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> MHz should be noted. In this
        frequency range <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few milli-watts</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 - 10 V/m</ENAMEX>) were
        sufficient to inhibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX>. Tests on other
        locations of the dipole relative to the phantom (near the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX>, the loop or the meander) showed no influence up to a
        maximum available radiation power of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 W.</ENAMEX> The uncertainty
        of the transmitting power measurement was less than ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>,
        and is basically composed of the uncertainty of the power
        measurement itself and the uncertainty of the direction
        coupler parameters.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11shows</NUMEX> the E field distribution for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz at
        a transmit power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the
        observed interference level at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz. The magnitude of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> field at the location of the implant (dashed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectangle</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m.</ENAMEX> The calculation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> MHz
        shows an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> field of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m</ENAMEX> at the location of the
        implant for a transmit power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.24</NUMEX> W.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The examinations have shown that the exposure of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> to electromagnetic fields of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">900 MHz</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>
        MHz mobile phones does not result in inhibition or changes
        in the shape of the stimulation pulses. The investigations
        performed with mobile phones did not indicate a direct risk
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> while using the tested mobile phones
        in positions corresponding to the intended use. Tests with
        increased transmitting power have shown that an inhibition
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> is caused at frequency dependent power
        levels. An "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On/Off</ENAMEX>" switching of the reed switch of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implant</ENAMEX> could not be observed. Both interference levels
        found with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> signals using broadband dipoles (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 V/m</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz) are
        below the maximum nominal peak power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> mobile phones.
        The GSM specifications allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+/- 2dB</ENAMEX> offset from the
        nominal output power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz,
        respectively. Even the lower boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> power
        specifications (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> MHz)
        are above the interference levels found with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> signals
        using broadband dipoles. The question of why we could not
        find interference with real GSM phones although the
        interference levels found with broadband dipoles are below
        the emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> specifications remains open. A
        possible explanation is that a mobile phone is covered with
        a plastic case with losses which absorb energy and
        therefore reduce the emitted fields. Our broadband dipoles
        were not covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX>. Furthermore the plastic case
        of the mobile phone prevents the antenna or other metallic
        parts from touching the phantom shell as with the broadband
        dipoles we used. Particularly low interference levels were
        observed in the frequency range around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> MHz. This
        frequency range is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> mobile phones. Further
        examinations including mobile phones operating in this
        frequency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> are recommended. A major finding was the
        strong frequency dependent interference level. Due to lack
        of information about the implant, particularly details
        about the electronic circuit design, the reason for the
        strong frequency dependence of the interference level and
        the very low interference level around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> MHz could not
        be determined. Other types of neurological stimulators
        could also have a frequency dependent interference level
        but with interference levels below the emissions of mobile
        phones at other frequencies. Unfortunately such
        neurological stimulators (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soletra, Kinetra</ENAMEX>)
        were not available to perform similar tests. The assumption
        that the implant with a low battery level would be more
        susceptible to electromagnetic fields proved to be wrong.
        Both tested implants showed the same interference level.
        Regarding mobile phone safety of neurological pulse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generators Medtronic</ENAMEX> only has information about the "Activa
        System" ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medtronic Web Site</ENAMEX> ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medtronic</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/neuro/et/</ENAMEX>fields.html: 
        Most of the electrical devices that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are around in a normal day will not harm the Activa
        System. This includes household appliances, computers,
        office machines, cellular phones, and personal radios.
        Special circuits inside the neurostimulator protect it from
        extreme electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> ). Until information is
        available about the mobile phone compatibility of other
        neurological implants, especially older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and there
        is a clarification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ITREL-III</ENAMEX> interference below the
        emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSM</ENAMEX> mobile phones, we recommend the following
        precautions based on investigations with cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pacemakers: 1</ENAMEX>. To use the phone at the ear opposite the
        side of the implant and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. To carry the cell phone on the
        opposite side of the implant when it is in use or in
        "stand-by" modus. Due to the fact we were not aware of any
        investigations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX> and mobile phones using other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Mobile Telecommunications System</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMTS</ENAMEX>) we suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBS</ENAMEX> should take into
        account the safety recommendations given above.
