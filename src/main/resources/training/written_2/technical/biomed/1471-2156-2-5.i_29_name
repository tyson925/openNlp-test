        For the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is
        the preferred carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is present in the
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, transcription of a large number of genes
        encoding products involved in the metabolism of alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> is repressed (for reviews, see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>].
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> include the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAL</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SUC2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAL</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STA genes</ENAMEX>, required, respectively,
        for the utilization of galactose, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sucrose/raffinose,</ENAMEX>
        maltose, and starch.
        At many of these genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose repression</ENAMEX> is mediated,
        at least in part, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-dependent repressor Mig1</ENAMEX>,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc-finger protein</ENAMEX> that binds 
        in vitro to DNA consensus sites
        consisting of a GC-rich core and flanking AT sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. Mig1 is thought to bind to several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, including
        
        GAL1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAL4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUC2</ENAMEX> and 
        MAL62, and to effect transcriptional
        repression by interacting with the co-repressor complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ssn6-Tup1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Mig1's activity is regulated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and subcellular localization: in high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mig1 protein</ENAMEX> is hypophosphorylated and in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, where it can repress transcription; upon
        withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mig1</ENAMEX> is rapidly phosphorylated and
        transported into the cytoplasm [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. This regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> requires the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Snf1/</ENAMEX>Snf4
        kinase complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Deletion of 
        MIG1, however, only partially
        relieves <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> such as 
        SUC2, whereas deletion of either 
        SSN6 or 
        TUP1 completely abolishes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        repression. Moreover, the 
        STA1 gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae var. 
        diastaticus, which is also repressed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, is unaffected by 
        mig1Δ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Therefore, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Mig1</NUMEX> are required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        repression. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig2</TIMEX>, which shares
        sequence similarity with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Mig1</NUMEX> in their zinc finger regions
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. Genetic analysis suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mig2</ENAMEX> plays a
        minor role relative to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX>.
        Recently, a previously uncharacterized gene, 
        NRG1 (Negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-repressed genes</ENAMEX>), was shown to be required for
        glucose repression of the 
        STA1 gene in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae var. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastaticus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. These studies
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LexA-Nrg1</ENAMEX> behaves as a repressor of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct and that this repression is dependent on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ssn6</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tup1</TIMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nrg1</ENAMEX> and Ssn6
        interact with each other in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> pull-down
        assays, indicating that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> may repress via the same
        pathway as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX>. Consistent with these results, Nrg1
        appears to bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> within the 
        STA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        The 
        SUC2 gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> has been extensively
        studied with respect to its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
        Glucose repression of 
        SUC2 is mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ssn6/Tup1</ENAMEX> and 
        SUC2 has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Mig1 binding sites in
        its regulatory region. Additionally, in high glucose its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> is also occupied by positioned nucleosomes, which
        cause transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> themselves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derepression</ENAMEX> in low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is correlated with a loss of
        both Mig1- and nucleosome-mediated repression, although the
        precise relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> is not
        clear.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX> screens have identified a large number of genes,
        named 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SNF (Sucrose Non-Fermenting</ENAMEX>) that are
        required for derepression of 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18</TIMEX>]. Genetic analyses and subsequent
        studies have traditionally divided 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNF genes</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> group
        encodes the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase Snf1</ENAMEX> and its associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator Snf4</ENAMEX>, required to antagonize the repression
        caused by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mig1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 19</TIMEX>]. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consists of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swi/Snf</ENAMEX> complex required to counter the
        repressive effects of chromatin by remodeling nucleosomes
        in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent manner (for review see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Suppressors of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">swi/snf mutations</ENAMEX>, such as 
        spt6, do not suppress 
        snf1Δ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], and 
        ssn6, a strong suppressor of 
        snf1Δ, only partially suppress 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">swi/snf</ENAMEX> mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        In this work, we report the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Nrg1</ENAMEX> in a
        genetic screen for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>. We show that Nrg1
        plays a role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
        SUC2 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. Thus, at these genes,
        Mig1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig2 and Nrg1</TIMEX> are partially redundant for mediating
        repression by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Consistent with our findings, recent
        results have demonstrated an interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Snf1</TIMEX> and
        Nrg1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. We also present experiments that test the
        genetic interactions between 
        mig1Δ, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nrg1Δ</ENAMEX> and deletions of various
        genes encoding activators that function at the 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Isolation of a high-copy-number suppressor of
          snf2Δ
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swi/Snf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is required for normal levels of
          expression of 
          SUC2 when cells are grown in low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. To identify factors that might be functionally
          related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swi/Snf</ENAMEX>, we screened for high-copy-number
          plasmids that could suppress a 
          snf2Δ mutation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods). To sensitize the screen, we used an allele of 
          SUC2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUC2-36</ENAMEX>, that allows an
          elevated level of 
          SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> in the absence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swi/Snf</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The 
          SUC2-36 mutation is a single base
          pair change, AT to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-401</NUMEX> relative to the 
          SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>. 
          SUC2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> strains still have a Raf
          -phenotype in a 
          snf2Δ mutant.
          To identify high-copy-number suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, we
          used a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2μ</NUMEX> circle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> to transform the 
          snf2Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUC2-36</ENAMEX> strain FY1845 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and screened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> transformants for those with a Raf
          +phenotype. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eighty-two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were identified, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> of
          which contained the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SNF2</NUMEX> gene. Among the remaining
          plasmids, most conferred a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raf</ENAMEX> +phenotype. We
          focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> that conferred the strongest Raf
          +phenotype. This plasmid contained a chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          genomic fragment that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX> from within the 
          NRG1 gene (open reading frame
          YDR043C) through the 
          HEM12 gene (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YDR047W</NUMEX>). Subcloning
          experiments identified the partial 
          NRG1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> as the sequence
          responsible for suppression of 
          snf2Δ and demonstrated that this
          suppression occurred in both 
          SUC2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> and 
          SUC2 +genetic backgrounds (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
          NRG1 is predicted to encode a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> zinc fingers in the carboxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX>. Sequence analysis revealed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2μ</NUMEX> plasmid
          that confers suppression of 
          snf2Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encodes</ENAMEX> just the amino
          terminal region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX>, lacking the zinc fingers. To
          test if the complete 
          NRG1 gene causes the same high copy
          number phenotype, we subcloned the complete 
          NRG1 gene into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2μ</NUMEX> plasmid and
          tested it for suppression of 
          snf2Δ. Our results demonstrate that
          the complete 
          NRG1 gene on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2μ</NUMEX> plasmid does not
          suppress 
          snf2Δ (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          NRG1encodes a repressor of transcription
          To characterize further the role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> with respect
          to 
          SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>, we constructed
          and analyzed an 
          nrg1Δ mutant. The 
          nrg1Δ mutant grows normally on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, sucrose, or galactose,
          demonstrating that 
          NRG1 is not essential for grwoth
          and that 
          nrg1Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> can utilize several
          different carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
          To test for the requirement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          repression, we tested growth of an 
          nrg1Δ mutant on YP sucrose media
          containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose analog</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-deoxyglucose</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-DG</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG causes glucose repression but cannot be used as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. Therefore, wild-type
          cells do not grow on YP sucrose plates that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG,
          due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          SUC2. However, strains defective
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> can grow on this medium as they
          express 
          SUC2 even in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG.
          We found that an 
          nrg1Δ mutant was able to grow on YP
          sucrose plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG, suggesting that 
          nrg1Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are indeed defective
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose repression</ENAMEX>. To assess the role of Nrg1
          relative to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other factors known to be required
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1 and Mig2</TIMEX>, we compared the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> caused by 
          nrg1Δ, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mig1Δ</TIMEX>, and 
          mig2Δ, as well as testing
          combinations of these deletions. We observed that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> single mutants grow with different strengths on YP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sucrose 2-DG</ENAMEX> plates in the order 
          mig1Δ > <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nrg1Δ > mig2Δ</TIMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The double and triple mutants had stronger phenotypes
          than the single mutants (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These results
          strongly suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mig2</ENAMEX> are each
          required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression at the 
          SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX> playing the
          major role. We also tested growth of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> on YP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">galactose</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG plates and found that only the triple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> was able to grow, albeit weakly, on this medium,
          perhaps because galactose is a poor carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). This suggests that each of these three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proteins</ENAMEX> contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Glucose repression of transcription is defective in
          nrg1Δ
          To test whether the 
          nrg1Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-DG plates is
          caused by altered transcription, we performed Northern
          analyses to 
          SUC2 mRNA levels. Under repressing
          conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>), the level of 
          SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was increased by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fold in an 
          nrg1Δ strain compared to a
          wild-type control (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). Consistent with previously
          published results, a 
          mig1Δ mutant had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-
          to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> fold increase in 
          SUC2 mRNA levels while a 
          mig2Δ mutant had no detectable
          defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          SUC2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 12</ENAMEX>]. We also analyzed the
          
          SUC2 mRNA levels in double and
          triple mutant combinations. In general, multiple
          mutations caused greater derepression, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 79-fold</NUMEX> for
          the triple mutant, 
          nrg1Δ <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mig1Δ</NUMEX> mig2Δ (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>).
          These data demonstrate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mig2</NUMEX> all
          contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          SUC2. 
          We also tested if an 
          nrg1Δ affects <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX> as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials</ENAMEX>
          and Methods. Both 
          nrg1Δ and 
          mig1Δ mutations cause a defect in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          GAL1 and 
          GAL10, whereas 
          mig2Δ alone had no effect (Figure
          3B). As for 
          SUC2, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive effects</ENAMEX> were
          observed in double and triple mutant strains, up to a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-fold</NUMEX> effect for the 
          nrg1Δ <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mig1Δ mig2Δ</NUMEX> triple mutant
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). These data indicate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> proteins
          are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL1-GAL10</ENAMEX>, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig2</TIMEX> playing only
          a minor role.
        
        
          Deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIG1or NRG1suppresses</ENAMEX> mutations in both
          SNF1and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWI/SNFgenes</ENAMEX>
          Activation of 
          SUC2 transcription depends upon
          both the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Snf1/Snf4</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the Swi/Snf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleosome</ENAMEX> remodeling complex. To address the
          relationship of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nrg1</NUMEX> to both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and to compare it
          to Mig1, we tested the abilities of 
          nrg1Δ and 
          mig1Δ to suppress the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gal -, Suc -</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raf</ENAMEX> -phenotypes of mutations in 
          SNF1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWI/SNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Our results (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) show that both 
          nrg1Δ and 
          mig1Δ suppress, albeit sometimes
          weakly, mutations in both 
          SNF1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWI/SNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. With respect to
          suppression of 
          snf1Δ, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mig1Δ</ENAMEX> is the stronger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suppressor</ENAMEX>, with suppression detectable for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal</ENAMEX>"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The observed suppression by 
          mig1Δ is consistent with previous
          results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. The 
          nrg1Δ mutation did not detectably
          suppress either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suc -or Raf</ENAMEX> -phenotypes caused by 
          snf1Δ. With respect to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">swi/snf mutations</ENAMEX>, we tested
          suppression of both 
          snf2Δ and 
          swp73Δ and observed weak
          suppression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gal</ENAMEX> -and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suc</ENAMEX> phenotypes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
          Suppression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raf</ENAMEX> -phenotype was not detectable.
          There appear to be some gene-specific interactions as
          suppression of 
          swp73Δ by 
          mig1Δ was stronger than the
          suppression observed for the other pairs tested.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our results demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Nrg1</ENAMEX> plays a role in
        glucose repression of the 
        SUC2 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. Consistent with a role
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression, an 
        nrg1Δ mutation suppresses the defects
        of a 
        snf1Δ mutant. Recent results from an
        independent study have demonstrated an interaction between
        Snf1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nrg1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Our results also suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nrg1</ENAMEX> is
        partially redundant with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other factors required for
        glucose repression, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1 and Mig2</TIMEX>. At 
        SUC2 and 
        GAL1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> appear to
        be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression, because double- and
        triple-deletion mutations have additive effects.
        Interestingly, both 
        nrg1Δ and 
        mig1Δ can also suppress the defects
        caused by mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swi/Snf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mig2</ENAMEX> are partially redundant,
        current evidence suggestions that they do not function in
        the same relative fashion at all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-repressible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. For example, while 
        mig1Δ and 
        nrg1Δ cause comparable defects at 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL1-GAL10</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nrg1Δ</NUMEX> causes a weaker
        defect at 
        SUC2. Mig2 appears to have only a
        minimal function at either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nrg1</ENAMEX> is
        the major repressor at 
        STA1, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-repression does
        not require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mig1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Therefore, some gene-specific
        specialization exists among these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressors</ENAMEX>.
        A previous study of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> provided evidence that it
        interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ssn6</ENAMEX> and confers repression by recruitment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ssn6/Tup1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. We initially identified 
        NRG1 in our studies by the isolation
        of a high-copy-number plasmid encoding a fragment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX>,
        lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-finger domain. Likely, the phenotype
        caused by this plasmid is caused by interference of
        repression by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ssn6/Tup1.</ENAMEX>
        Our studies have not yet distinguished between a direct
        or indirect effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression at 
        SUC2 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL1-GAL10</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible indirect
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nrg1</ENAMEX> could be by regulation of 
        MIG1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
        analysis showed that 
        MIG1 mRNA levels are unaffected by an
        
        nrg1Δ mutation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Zhou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). We tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> for binding to
        the 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and those experiments
        are briefly summarized here. We screened for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding of
        Nrg1 to the 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region using a
        previously described <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Nrg1</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] and a
        gel shift assay. Our results demonstrated specific DNA
        binding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1022</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-825</NUMEX> region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' of 
        SUC2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Zhou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Winston</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished results). However, a deletion of this region
        does not alter 
        SUC2 expression. Based on the
        similarity between the zinc fingers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1 and Mig1</TIMEX> and
        our binding studies, the binding site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> may contain a
        GC-rich core. Another such site in the 
        SUC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> may occur at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-570</NUMEX> with
        the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGGCCCA</ENAMEX>. Although we did not detect a gel
        shift of a fragment containing this site, it is still
        possible that it is recognized and bound by Nrg1 
        in vivo. Furthermore, although an
        Nrg1 consensus binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] exists at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-976</NUMEX> of 
        SUC2, we were unable to detect
        binding to this site by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Nrg1</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> also did not
        compete the binding that we detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Nrg1</ENAMEX>. This
        discrepancy between our findings and previous results can
        be explained by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Nrg1</ENAMEX> in their binding studies than we did.
        Finally, we did not detect any binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nrg1</NUMEX> to the Mig1
        binding sites. Thus, the DNA binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nrg1</NUMEX> to 
        SUC2 remains to be resolved.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, these studies have identified Nrg1 as a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> repressor required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression at 
        SUC2 and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX>. Based on the similarity
        between the zinc fingers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1 and Mig1</TIMEX>, the phenotypes
        of 
        nrg1Δ and 
        mig1Δ, and the reported interaction
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Nrg1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ssn6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nrg1</TIMEX> likely functions by
        binding to the target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and recruiting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ssn6/Tup1</ENAMEX> complex. The relative and possible cooperative
        roles of each of these repressors in recruiting Ssn6-Tup1
        remains to be determined.

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> used in this study were previously described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glucose</ENAMEX>, galactose, sucrose or raffinose was added
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> final weight per volume. For solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing
          a carbon source other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or glycerol, antimycin
          A was also added to a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 μg/ml.</ENAMEX> To test
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> repression of 
          SUC2 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAL genes</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-deoxyglucose</TIMEX> was added
          to YP sucrose-antimycin A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YP</ENAMEX> galactose-antimycin A

          discovered during the course of this study that a 
          ura3Δ0 strain had half the amount
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX> mRNA of a

          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> galactose. A 
          ura3Δ0 strain also grew more slowly
          than a 
          URA3 strain on minimal media
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sucrose</ENAMEX> or galactose. We do not yet have an
          explanation for this phenomenon. To overcome this growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defect</ENAMEX>, uracil was added to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YP</ENAMEX> plates to a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 μM</NUMEX>.
