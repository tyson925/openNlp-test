        In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX>, a key event
        accompanying exit from mitosis is the inactivation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clb/Cdc28</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase</ENAMEX> achieved through degradation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clb</ENAMEX> and accumulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clb/Cdc28</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> Sic1
        (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX>/C) ubiquitin ligase and its substrate specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">activator Hct1/Cdh1</ENAMEX> are required for degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Clb2</TIMEX>,
        the major mitotic cyclin in the budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (reviewed in
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ). Whereas 
        hct1Δ and 
        sic1Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appear relatively normal,
        
        hct1Δ <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sic1Δ</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are inviable,
        presumably due to their inability to extinguish Cdc28
        activity in telophase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        The complexity in the regulation of mitotic exit is
        underscored by the existence of a set of genes essential
        for this process, referred to as the "mitotic exit network
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>)". They encode the GTP-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Tem1</ENAMEX> and its
        putative guanine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Lte1</ENAMEX>, the dual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">specificity protein phosphatase Cdc14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinases
        Cdc5, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc15</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dbf2/Dbf20</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Dbf2</NUMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Mob1
        (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ) and the spindle-pole-body component
        Nud1 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Conditional-lethal temperature sensitive (ts)
        mutations in any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN genes</ENAMEX> cause cells to arrest in
        late mitosis with elevated mitotic Cdk activity when
        shifted to the restrictive temperature. Inactivation of
        Cdc28 by overexpression of Sic1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suppresses multiple MEN</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> and hyperactivation of Cdc28 by overexpression of
        Clb2 exacerbates their phenotypes, consistent with the idea
        that a key function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN proteins</ENAMEX> is to eradicate
        Cdc28 activity during the transition from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">anaphase/telophase</ENAMEX> to G1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Recently, important advances have been made in our
        understanding of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> is switched on during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphase</ENAMEX>. Tem1 is thought to be kept inactive throughout
        early mitosis by the two-component GTPase-activating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein complex Bub2/Bfa1</ENAMEX> which co-localizes with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tem1</TIMEX> at
        the spindle pole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . When the mitotic spindle
        penetrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> neck, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tem1</NUMEX>-bound spindle
        pole body is translocated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell where a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical</ENAMEX> pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lte1</ENAMEX> is thought to activate Tem1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ]
        . In addition to this spatial regulation, the GTPase
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bfa1</ENAMEX> is thought to be inactivated through its
        phosphorylation by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cdc5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , but it remains unknown how
        this process is coordinated with the presumed juxtaposition
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lte1 and Tem1</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell. Despite this rapid
        progress in understanding the signals that regulate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>, the direct downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> have yet to
        be apprehended.
        To address how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> components downstream of Cdc15
        are organized and what their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> are, we sought 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tab</ENAMEX> (telophase arrest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bypassed</ENAMEX>) mutants that alleviate the essential
        requirement for 
        CDC15. In theory, 
        tab mutants could act downstream of
        or parallel to 
        CDC15, and could be either
        loss-of-function mutations in genes that inhibit exit from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> or gain-of-function mutations in genes that promote
        exit from mitosis. To our surprise, mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were uncovered, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recessive</ENAMEX> ( 
        tab1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-tab3</ENAMEX> ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> being
        dominant ( 
        TAB5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ). We have shown in earlier
        studies that 
        tab2-1 is a reduction-of-function
        mutation in 
        NET1 (a.k.a. 
        CFI1 ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] and that 
        TAB6 is a gain-of-function mutation
        in 
        CDC14 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Net1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequesters</ENAMEX> Cdc14
        in the nucleolus and inactivates it in preanaphase cells.
        During exit from mitosis, a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TEM1/CDC15</ENAMEX> -dependent signal frees
        Cdc14 from the nucleolus and allows it to promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inactivation of Clb/Cdc28</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17 19</NUMEX> ] . The fact that both
        Net1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> are directly involved in exit from mitosis
        validates the effectiveness of the tab screen and heightens
        the potential value of the uncharacterized 
        tab mutants. Here, we present a
        detailed description of the 
        tab mutant screen, and describe a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAB gene</ENAMEX>,

        Results
        
          Cdc15 promotes activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clb</ENAMEX> proteolysis by a
          post-translational mechanism
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcription</ENAMEX> has been postulated to play an important
          role in triggering exit from mitosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . For
          example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dbf2</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> that promotes exit from
          mitosis, is associated with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX> transcription
          regulatory complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In addition, the Swi5
          transcription factor activates 
          SIC1 expression during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX>
          anaphase, and both 
          sic1Δ and 
          swi5Δ are synthetically lethal with
          
          dbf2Δ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 7</NUMEX> ] . To address if
          production of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is essential for exit from
          mitosis, we examined the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> synthesis
          inhibitor cycloheximide on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Clb2</TIMEX> degradation, a key aspect
          of this process. Mutant 
          cdc15-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were uniformly
          arrested in late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anaphase</ENAMEX>/telophase by incubation at the
          restrictive temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>. The cultures were then
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg/ml cycloheximide</ENAMEX>
          before being returned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25°C</NUMEX> to reverse the 
          cdc15-2 arrest. In the absence of
          cycloheximide, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX> accumulated and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clb2</ENAMEX> disappeared as
          cells exited mitosis (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, lanes 1-4</ENAMEX>). In the
          presence of cycloheximide, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX> accumulation was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abolished</ENAMEX>, but Clb2 degradation still occurred with
          apparently normal kinetics (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-8</TIMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-12</ENAMEX>). Although this result does not exclude the likely
          possibility that synthesis of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. Sic1</ENAMEX>)
          normally facilitates the exit from mitosis, it reveals
          that a key aspect of mitotic exit - inactivation of Cdc28
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> via degradation of the mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin</ENAMEX> Clb2
          - can proceed beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cdc15-dependent</TIMEX> step without
          synthesis of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          A screen for telophase arrest bypassed
          (tab)mutants
          To understand how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN mobilizes</ENAMEX> post-translational
          mechanisms to trigger mitotic exit, we conducted a
          genetic screen for 'telophase arrest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bypassed</ENAMEX>' ( 
          tab ) mutants that bypassed the
          essential requirement for 
          CDC15 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Because the
          essential requirement for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CLNs 1, 2</ENAMEX>, and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in entry into S phase can be
          bypassed by deletion of a gene ( 
          SIC1 ) that inhibits entry into S
          phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , we reasoned by analogy that our screen
          might reveal key negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">anaphase/telophase -> G1</ENAMEX> transition.
          Ninety independent cultures of 
          cdc15Δ [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pMET3-cdc15-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX>] were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grown in inducing medium (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">- methionine</NUMEX>) at
          permissive temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25°C</NUMEX>) to allow occurrence of
          spontaneous mutations. The cultures were subsequently
          plated on repressing medium (+ methionine) at a
          temperature semi-restrictive for the 
          cdc15-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> allele (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30°C</NUMEX>) to enrich for
          mutations that supported the growth of 
          CDC15- deficient cells. To identify
          mutations that allowed complete bypass of 
          cdc15Δ, representative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          from each plate were tested for their ability to grow on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA-containing medium (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA selectively blocks the
          growth of plasmid-bearing 
          URA3+ cells). The parental strain
          failed to grow due to its inability to proliferate
          without the [ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MET3-cdc15-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX>. In
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five mutants</TIMEX> survived on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA.
          Furthermore, all of them had lost the plasmid as
          determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> analysis (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> of
          these mutants were amenable to genetic manipulation and
          harbored single mutations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were assigned
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> recessive and three semi-dominant/dominant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linkage groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). We referred to these mutants as
          
          tab mutants for their
          telophase-arrest-bypass (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tab</ENAMEX> +) phenotype. In addition,
          we serendipitously found that 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">srp1-49</ENAMEX> could bypass 
          cdc15Δ (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; data not
          shown).
          Earlier studies identified 
          tab2 and 
          TAB6 as mutations in 
          NET1 and 
          CDC14, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 18</NUMEX> ] .
          Net1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detains Cdc14</ENAMEX> in the nucleolus and inactivates it
          until a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tem1</NUMEX>-dependent signal sets Cdc14 free to promote
          exit from mitosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The fact that both Net1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> are directly involved in exit from mitosis
          prompted us to further analyze 
          tab mutants.
        
        
          Does bypass of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cdc15Δ</TIMEX> require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sic1</NUMEX> accumulation and
          Clb2 degradation?
          Either Sic1 accumulation or Clb2 degradation is
          proposed to be sufficient to sustain mitotic exit [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          Although 
          cdc15-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mutants are defective in
          both processes, ectopic activation of either one should
          restore exit from mitosis and growth. Thus, to gain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into their molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, we asked if bypass
          of 
          cdc15Δ by 
          tab mutations required 
          SIC1 or 
          HCT1. Whereas all 
          tab mutants tested were able to
          bypass 
          cdc15Δ in the absence of 
          HCT1 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ( 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-</ENAMEX>1and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TAB 6-1</ENAMEX>) were able to bypass 
          cdc15Δ in the absence of either 
          SIC1 or 
          HCT1<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">, four</TIMEX> 
          tab mutants ( 
          tab1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab3-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB5-1</ENAMEX>, and 
          TAB7-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) failed to bypass in the
          absence of 
          SIC1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Efficient bypass of mitotic arrest by both
          SIC1-dependent and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIC1-independent</TIMEX> tabmutants is
          accompanied by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ectopic Sic1</TIMEX> accumulation and Clb2
          degradation
          We have previously shown that both 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-</ENAMEX>1and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1efficiently</ENAMEX> bypassed the
          mitotic arrest caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tem1</NUMEX>-depletion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 18</NUMEX> ] .
          Furthermore, bypass was accompanied by ectopic Sic1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation and Clb2</ENAMEX> degradation. Because both 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-</ENAMEX>1and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1could</ENAMEX> bypass 
          cdc15Δ in the absence of 
          SIC1, we tested if the same bypass
          efficiency could be achieved by 
          tab3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a 
          SIC1 -dependent bypass mutant. We
          used a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tem1Δ::GAL1-UPL</ENAMEX>-TEM1 strain that
          allowed for conditional depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tem1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] to
          impose a conditional late mitotic block, and introduced
          the 
          tab3-1 mutation into this
          background. Wild type or 
          tab3<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-1</ENAMEX> derivatives of 
          tem1Δ::<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL1-UPL-TEM1</ENAMEX> were grown in
          galactose medium ( 
          TEM1 induced), arrested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> with
          α factor, and released into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-containing medium to
          repress 
          TEM1 expression (time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). As
          expected, the majority (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAB</ENAMEX> +cells arrested with large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. In the 
          tab3-1 strain, however, a
          significant fraction (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) of cells had <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">≥ 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> bodies
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> after release, indicating that they had
          undergone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> extra round of budding (Figure
          3A). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-six percent</NUMEX> represents a minimum estimate of 
          TEM1 bypass efficiency in 
          tab3-1 cultures, since cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> could have arisen from bypass events
          followed by successful cell separation.
          Having established that 
          tab3-1 indeed bypassed Tem1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> at a cellular level, we tested whether Sic1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation and Clb2</ENAMEX> degradation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hallmark events
          that accompany exit from mitosis, also occurred. 
          tem1Δ::<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL1-UPL-TEM1</ENAMEX> cells carrying
          
          TAB3 or 
          tab3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> alleles were arrested in G1
          with α factor, and released into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> medium ( 
          TEM1 repressed, time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). After
          cells had exited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX>, α factor was added back to stop
          cells from cycling beyond the next <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase. As
          Tem1-depleted 
          TAB3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells exited G1</ENAMEX>, Clb2
          accumulated and remained at high levels, whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degraded</ENAMEX> and remained at low levels (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, left
          panels). In contrast, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tem1</NUMEX>-depleted 
          tab3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells progressed through
          mitosis, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Clb2</TIMEX> was almost completely degraded and Sic1
          accumulated to high levels (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, right panels).
          These data suggest that like 
          tab2-1 and 
          TAB6-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab3-1</ENAMEX> efficiently bypassed
          
          tem1Δ by enabling Tem1-independent
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clb2</ENAMEX> and accumulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX>. We conclude
          that the apparent 
          SIC1 -dependence of bypass by 
          tab3-1 and other 
          tab mutants relates more to the
          strength of the particular mutation, rather than the
          mechanism of bypass. In support of this hypothesis, we
          recently observed that the 
          SIC1 -independent bypass mutant
          15D2 is allelic to the 
          SIC1 -dependent 
          tab1-1 mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Azzam</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN genes</ENAMEX> are required for exit from mitosis, but
          it has not yet been tested whether this is the sole
          essential function of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN genes</ENAMEX>, or if some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> genes
          play critical roles in other processes. This question is
          amplified by the observations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> participates in
          both chromosome segregation and cytokinesis ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] ;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et al.</ENAMEX>, submitted), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mob1</ENAMEX> binds an essential protein

          The 
          tab mutants provide a unique
          opportunity to address this issue. Accordingly, we tested
          
          if net1

          fold lower) efficiency (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A), suggesting that
          although the sole essential function of 
          CDC15, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEM1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DBF2</TIMEX>, and 
          MOB1 is to drive cells out of

          functions.
        
        
          Some but not all tabmutants exhibit additional
          phenotypes including growth defects, perturbations in the
          nucleolus, and elevated rates of chromosome loss
          To further characterize the 
          tab mutants, we tested whether they
          display other phenotypes in an otherwise wild type
          background. 
          tab mutants grown to exponential
          phase at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX> and shifted to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37°C</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> did
          not arrest at a particular stage of the cell cycle (data
          not shown). When 
          tab mutants were plated on YPD

          TAB5 and 
          TAB7 grew normally (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>),
          suggesting that bypass of 
          CDC15 does not necessarily cause
          defective growth. However,

          suggesting that at least some 
          tab mutations reside in genes that
          have multiple functions. Indeed, 
          NET1 additionally modulates
          nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and transcription [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18</NUMEX> ] .
          The release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nucleolar Net1</TIMEX> promotes

          alteration of rDNA morphology, and reduction of rRNA
          synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18</NUMEX> ] . To test whether perturbation of
          nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is consistently associated with
          bypass of 
          cdc15Δ, we immunolocalized the
          nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen Nop1</ENAMEX> in all 
          tab mutants. Nop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> was
          also perturbed in 
          tab1-1 and 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>, but was normal in

          TAB7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ),
          suggesting that a gross change in nucleolar structure is
          not required for bypass.
          Because the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tem1 antagonists</ENAMEX> and mitotic
          checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Bub2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bfa1</ENAMEX> negatively regulate
          exit from mitosis and cytokinesis in response to both DNA
          damage and spindle misorientation ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ; reviewed in
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ), we asked whether bypass of 
          TEM1 -dependent regulation can
          cause chromosome instability. All 
          tab mutants are in the W303
          background in which the 
          ade2-1 mutation makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> red
          after adenine in the growth medium has been depleted. A 
          URA3-marked tester <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>chromosome
          carrying the 
          SUP11 suppressor transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA gene</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ) was introduced into

          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1</ENAMEX>, the two 
          tab mutants with well-characterized
          bypass mechanisms. Cells that retain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>chromosome
          should form white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> due to suppression of 
          ade2-1 by 
          SUP11, whereas loss of this
          chromosome should result in a red sector or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>. The
          extent of chromosome loss (expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that
          were red or had red sectors) was low in wild-type and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1cells</ENAMEX> (< <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>), and high
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>) in 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In
          comparison, in a strain lacking the anaphase-inhibitor
          Pds1, ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> suffered chromosome loss
          events (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Since 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1but</ENAMEX> not 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1also</ENAMEX> perturbs nucleolar
          functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1is</ENAMEX> a more specific and
          representative bypass mutant. Thus, 
          TEM1 regulation can be
          short-circuited without a major effect on chromosome
          loss. Consistent with this notion, cells lacking Bub2 (an
          inhibitor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Tem1</NUMEX>) showed a similarly moderate extent of
          chromosome loss (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We propose that
          additional functions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> ensure faithful transmission

          of chromosomes.
        
        
          Molecular cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TABgenes</ENAMEX> and implication of
          nuclear transport in the regulation of mitotic
          exit
          We attempted to clone by complementation genes
          corresponding to the recessive 
          tab mutations by exploiting the
          fact that all of the recessive 
          tab mutants are ts for growth (see
          below). By this approach, 
          TAB1 was revealed to be 
          MTR10, a gene previously implicated
          in nuclear transport [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . We were unable to
          isolate plasmids that complemented 
          tab3 in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> tested.
          Both 
          MTR10 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TAB1</NUMEX> ) and 
          SRP1 belong to the nuclear
          transport receptor/adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (reviewed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] ).
          Mutant 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> and 
          mtr10 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 1-1cells</ENAMEX> accumulate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein Rpb11b</ENAMEX> in the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Thus, to
          evaluate a potential link between nuclear transport and
          the 
          tab phenotype, we evaluated the
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rpl11b-GFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] in all 
          tab mutants. Mutants expressing
          Rpl11b-GFP were grown to early-log phase at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX>, shifted
          to 37°C to induce the ts mutant phenotype (which also
          reduces synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> including
          Rpl11b), and shifted back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25°C</NUMEX> to induce new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. If the rate of mutant phenotype
          reversal is slower than restoration of ribosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, then Rpl11b should accumulate in the nucleus.
          Whereas Rpl11b-GFP was distributed relatively evenly in
          wild-type cells, it accumulated in the nucleus in a
          significant fraction of 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> and 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1cells</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX> and after 25°C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">->37°C -> 25°C</ENAMEX> shift (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] ). In
          addition, although 
          mtr10 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 1-1cells</ENAMEX> were relatively normal
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of them accumulated nuclear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rpl11b</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">25°C ->37°C -> 25°C</ENAMEX> shift (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Thus,
          multiple 
          tab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> accumulate Rpl11b in
          the nucleus, implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleocytoplasmic</ENAMEX> trafficking
          is involved in the regulation of mitotic exit. Other 
          tab mutants (such as 
          tab3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TAB5</TIMEX>, CDC14 
          TAB 6and 
          TAB7 ) showed no defect in this
          assay, suggesting that bypass 
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cdc15Δ</ENAMEX> can be achieved without
          perturbing nucleocytoplasmic transport.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>: A signalling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that can
          post-translationally trigger exit from mitosis
          Both transcriptional and post-translational controls
          have been implicated in the operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mitotic Exit</ENAMEX>
          Network and the regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anaphase</ENAMEX>/telophase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-> G1</ENAMEX> transition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 7 19 41</NUMEX> ] . To address whether
          the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> that acts downstream 
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CDC15</ENAMEX> can trigger a key aspect
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">anaphase/telophase -> G1</ENAMEX> transition (i.e.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inactivation of Clb/Cdc28</ENAMEX> via proteolysis of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Clb2</NUMEX>) in the
          absence of new gene expression, we evaluated the turnover
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clb2</ENAMEX> in cells released from a 
          cdc15-2 arrest in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycloheximide</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Clb2</TIMEX> was rapidly and
          efficiently degraded upon reversal of the 
          cdc15-2 block regardless of whether
          cycloheximide was present (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) although both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX> and cell separation require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> synthesis
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . This observation suggests that the exit from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> may be controlled by mechanisms
          fundamentally similar to those employed by animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>,
          which proceed through mitosis with highly condensed,
          transcriptionally silent chromosomes. Interestingly, all
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN genes</ENAMEX> have putative homologues in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome-www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stanford</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/Saccharomyces/worm/.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Isolation of tabmutants
          A deliberate search for bypass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> was a key
          aspect of the screen reported here, since numerous
          genetic interactions have been observed among components
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> (consult [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] for a summary). Formally
          speaking, it is not possible to order gene functions
          based on suppressive interactions involving
          reduction-of<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-function</NUMEX> (e.g. ts) alleles. For example, the
          
          net1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> allele suppressed ts
          mutations in both its downstream target 
          CDC14 and its upstream regulators 
          CDC5, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDC15</TIMEX>, and 
          DBF2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Since we sought
          mutants that bypassed 
          cdc15Δ, the 
          tab genes are predicted to function
          either downstream of or parallel to 
          CDC15, but not upstream of 
          CDC15. 
          The tab screen yielded both dominant and recessive
          mutants which mapped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The pattern
          of alleles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) does not satisfy a Poisson
          distribution, suggesting that the screen has not reached
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX>. The recessive 
          tab mutants are likely to represent
          reduction-of-function mutations in genes that inhibit
          exit from mitosis, and the dominant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAB mutants</ENAMEX> are likely to result
          from gain-of-function mutations in genes that promote
          exit from mitosis. This prediction is supported by our
          prior characterization of the 
          tab2-1 and 
          TAB6-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> alleles of 
          NET1 and 
          CDC14, respectively (see next
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX>). The fact that we recovered recessive,
          semi-dominant, and dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> in additional 
          tab genes suggests that there are
          likely to be multiple dosage-sensitive positive and
          negative regulatory controls that act downstream of or
          parallel to 
          CDC15. 
          
          tab mutants can be classified into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: those that bypass 
          cdc15Δ only in the presence of 
          SIC1 (e.g. 
          tab3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ), and those that can bypass

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> and cell biological experiments indicate

          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1failed</ENAMEX> to bypass

          downstream target of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17</NUMEX> ] . Cdc5 also regulates
          Net1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shou et al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in preparation), but 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-</ENAMEX>1bypassed 
          cdc5Δ with very low efficiency,

          CDC5 has other essential functions
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 25 26 45</NUMEX> ] .
          The most parsimonious <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that unifies all of these
          observations is as follows: Tem1 functions upstream of
          Cdc15, which in turn activates the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Dbf2-Mob1</NUMEX> protein
          kinase complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] . Together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>,
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins dislodge Cdc14</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nucleolar Net1</TIMEX>. Cdc14
          subsequently dephosphorylates (and thereby activates)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX> expression (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Swi5</NUMEX>) and C1b

          eliminating mitotic Cdk activity and promoting exit from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX>. The mechanisms by which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dbf2/</ENAMEX>Mob1
          promote the disassembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> remain unknown, raising
          the possibility that other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tab proteins</ENAMEX> serve as
          intermediaries in this process. One attractive hypothesis
          based on our identification of 
          MTR10 as a 
          tab gene is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN proteins</ENAMEX>
          regulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of a key
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the release process.
        
        
          Chromosome instability in tabmutants
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bub2/Bfa1 GTPase-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activating protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAP</ENAMEX>) complex
          inhibits the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> and cytokinesis in response to DNA
          damage and spindle misorientation ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ; reviewed in
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ). 
          bub2Δ and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1cells</ENAMEX> show similar
          chromosome instability as wild-type cells. In contrast, 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1cells</ENAMEX> have a dramatic
          chromosome instability phenotype, with some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          showing multiple red sectors indicative of multiple
          chromosome-loss events, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> completely red
          on the surface (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). Net1 is unlikely to directly
          regulate transmission of the tester chromosome, because
          it is only localized to rDNA in the nucleolus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX>
          ] . Thus, the difference between 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-</ENAMEX>1and 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1presumably</ENAMEX> results from
          molecular defects unique to the former mutant, including
          defective nucleolar structure and function, or perhaps
          defective nuclear transport ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Further
          study is required to reveal how the multifunctional Net1
          protein helps to ensure chromosome transmission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Multiple tabmutations influence nucleocytoplasmic
          transport
          Nuclear transport-defective mutations in 
          MTR10 and 
          SRP1 (mtr10 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 1-</ENAMEX>1and 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>, respectively) bypassed 
          cdc15Δ. Mtr10 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assembles</ENAMEX> with and
          functions as a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> receptor for the
          mRNA-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Npl3 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, 
          srp1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> also inhibits nuclear
          import of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including Npl3 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, reduction-of-function alleles of the
          karyopherin 
          KAP104 were also recovered in a
          screen for mutations that suppressed 
          cdc15-2 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Toh-e</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). 
          KAP104 is required for proper
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA binding proteins Nab2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hrp1</ENAMEX> to
          the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
          The only phenotype known to be shared by 
          srp1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mtr10</TIMEX>, and 
          kap104 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> is accumulation of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">60S ribosomal protein Rpl11b</ENAMEX> in the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . 
          SRP1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MTR10</TIMEX>, and 
          KAP104 may also collaborate to
          maintain the proper nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of α
          factor (or factors) that regulates mitotic exit. An
          alternative possibility is that they sequester an
          inactive stockpile of α factor that, upon mutation or
          signalling by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>, is released from these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportins</ENAMEX> and enables exit from mitosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] .
          Finally, it is possible that the transportin mutants
          enable bypass through an indirect perturbation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleolar</ENAMEX> architecture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Given that some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN proteins</ENAMEX> reside in the cytoplasm whereas their target
          - the RENT complex - resides in the nucleolus, it is
          tempting to speculate that nuclear transport is a target
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> action. Our failure to observe nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rpl11b</ENAMEX> in 
          tab3 and 
          TAB5<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-TAB7</NUMEX> mutants suggests that
          these 
          tab genes bypassed 
          cdc15Δ by a distinct mechanism.
          Regardless of the exact mechanisms of bypass, it is clear
          from these analyses that the release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from Net1
          is more intricately connected to cell regulation than was
          previously imagined.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> main conclusions on how exit from mitosis is
        regulated in the budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> can be derived. First, the
        sole essential function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Tem1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Dbf20</ENAMEX>, and
        Mob1 (but not Cdc5) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are to promote the release of
        Cdc14 from the nucleolus, as cells lacking these proteins
        can grow upon simultaneous reduction 
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NET1</TIMEX> activity. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, high
        chromosome loss rate was observed in 
        net1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1but</ENAMEX> not 
        CDC14 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB 6-1</ENAMEX>, suggesting that although 
        CDC15 -independent mitotic exit does
        not dramatically affect chromosome transmission, additional
        functions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> do. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, both 
        mtr10 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 1-</ENAMEX>1and 
        srp1-31 affect nuclear transport,
        suggesting that nuclear transport regulates mitotic
        exit.

          Strains and plasmids
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used in this study (listed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are isogenic to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W303</TIMEX>. Standard methods were employed
          for the culturing and manipulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . All
          plasmid constructions were based on the pRS vector series
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . To replace

          primers that amplified a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment that spanned the
          recombination junction. Deletions of 
          CDC5 and 
          TEM1 were carried out similarly. To

          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (from start codon to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> bps
          downstream of the stop codon) were amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of wild type (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RJD381</NUMEX>) or

          Isolation of tabmutants
          The scheme is outlined in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Ninety independent

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX> (to simultaneously repress expression and

          ] . When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was picked from a single

          indicating that they were true bypassers of 
          cdc15Δ. 
        
        
          Mutant characterization
          To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tab</ENAMEX> +phenotypes were due to single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mutations,</ENAMEX> 
          cdc15Δ tab strains were crossed to 
          cdc15Δ [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pMET3-cdc15-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX>] and
          the resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the viable spores should bypass 
          cdc15Δ (as indicated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA
          resistance) if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tab</ENAMEX> +phenotype was due to a single
          mutation. Out of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five mutants</TIMEX>, fifteen satisfied
          this criterion, and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> were discarded because
          they either failed to sporulate, or yielded few viable

          To introduce 
          tab mutations into the wild type
          background, 
          cdc15Δ tab strains were crossed to 
          CDC15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAB</ENAMEX>, and 
          tab spores were verified by
          crossing to 
          cdc15Δ [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX>], and
          demonstrating that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the resulting 
          cdc15Δ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segregants</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA
          resistant. All 
          cdc15Δ tab mutants were also
          crossed to strains harboring either

          HIS3] or 
          [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX>] [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS315</TIMEX>,
          LEU2] to introduce these plasmids. The resulting
          strains grew better than the original 
          cdc15Δ tab strains, and harbored
          selectable markers that facilitated subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crosses</ENAMEX>.
          To test whether 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab 2-1can</ENAMEX> bypass 
          tem1Δ, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dbf2Δ dbf20Δ</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mob1Δ</TIMEX>,
          cdc14Δ, and 
          cdc5Δ, we crossed 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-1</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WY39</NUMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WY218</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WY280</TIMEX>,
          WY288, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WY243</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WY214</ENAMEX>, respectively. The diploids were
          sporulated, and if ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>-deleted spores were
          resistant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA, then 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">net1-1</ENAMEX> could bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> null
          mutation.
          To test temperature sensitivity (ts) of 
          tab mutants, cells were spotted or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streaked</ENAMEX> onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPD</ENAMEX> plates, and incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>. Their
          growth was scored after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one to two days</TIMEX>.
          Nop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunolocalization</ENAMEX> was performed as described
          earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          The chromosome loss assay was carried out using a
          strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] backcrossed into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W303</NUMEX> background by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uhlmann</ENAMEX>. When cells were pre-grown in YPD liquid (instead
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD-URA</ENAMEX> solid) media before being tested on YPD plates,
          the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that were red or had red
          sectors remained similar for wild-type, 
          CDC14 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TAB 6-1</ENAMEX> 
          , and 
          bub2Δ strains, but was ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> for 
          net1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 2-1</ENAMEX>. This number was lower than
          the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> value observed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, but still
          significantly higher than the wild-type value (<
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Linkage analysis
          To assign 
          tab mutants to linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, 
          cdc15Δ tab [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3</ENAMEX> ]
          strains were crossed against each other, and the diploids
          were sporulated and dissected. If two 
          tab mutations belonged to the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linkage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, then all spores were expected to survive
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA. Otherwise, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one quarter</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spores</ENAMEX> would fail to bypass 
          cdc15Δ. The alleles of 
          TAB2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TAB3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TAB5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TAB6</TIMEX>, and 
          TAB7 (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were assigned
          this way. The recessive 
          tab mutants exhibited a ts growth
          phenotype that co-segregated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tab</ENAMEX> +phenotype.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complementation</ENAMEX> tests were used to assign <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the ts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> as alleles of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tab 1</ENAMEX>. After 
          TAB1 was shown to be 
          MTR10, other 
          tab1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were ascertained by
          their linkage to the 
          MTR10 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Molecular cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAB1and</ENAMEX> TAB2
          To clone 
          TAB1 and 
          TAB2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tab1-1</ENAMEX> and 
          tab2-1 mutant strains were
          transformed with plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> harboring yeast
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments, and incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
          before being shifted to 37°C [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Libraries</ENAMEX>

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Young</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] rescued 
          tab1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2μ</NUMEX> library
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ATCC#37323</NUMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] ) rescued 
          tab2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformants</ENAMEX> (enough to
          cover multiple genome equivalents) were screened, and
          plasmids retrieved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that grew at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-transformed into the original mutant strain to verify
          their complementation activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidate plasmids</ENAMEX> were
          sequenced, and the genomic regions containing the
          complementing activity were identified. 
          TAB1 resided on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromosome XV</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">631,500</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">637,950</NUMEX>, and 
          TAB2, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chromosome X</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291,900</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">299,466</NUMEX>. To confirm that these genomic fragments
          indeed carried the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAB genes</ENAMEX>, complementing fragments
          were cloned into the integrating vector [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS305</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LEU2</ENAMEX>],
          and linearized to target integration into the 
          tab locus in a 
          cdc15Δ::<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TRP1</NUMEX> tab [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>,
          URA3 ] strain. The transformants lost their Tab
          +phenotype, and when crossed to 
          cdc15Δ::<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TRP1</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>,
          URA3], the diploid yielded no spores that could
          bypass 
          cdc15Δ (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-50</NUMEX>). Since both
          genomic fragments contained multiple open reading frames
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>), each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and cloned into the integrating plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS305</TIMEX>. The
          resulting plasmids were transformed into 
          cdc15Δ::<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TRP1</NUMEX> tab [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pMET3-CDC15</TIMEX>,
          URA3 ] to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> that reversed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tab</ENAMEX>
          +phenotype. This analysis revealed 
          TAB1 to be 
          MTR10, and 
          TAB2 to be 
          YJL076W (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NET1</NUMEX>).

          used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . Correct integrants were verified by PCR
          using primers that amplified a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment that spanned
          the recombination junction. To assay if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> or 
          HCT1 was required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tab</ENAMEX>
          +phenotype of 
          tab mutants, 
          SIC1 or 
          HCT1 was replaced by

          URA3 ] strains. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformant</ENAMEX> was assayed for the
          occurrence of correct integration and its ability to
          survive on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA.

          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> so that ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> cells were arrested as
          large-budded cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycloheximide</ENAMEX> (CHX) was supplemented
          to a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg/ml</ENAMEX> to

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, the cultures were released to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25°C</NUMEX> at time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.
          Samples were taken at various time points after release.
