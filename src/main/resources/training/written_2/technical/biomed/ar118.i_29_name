          Introduction
          A reduction in the sex ratio (male : female) is
          characteristic of most autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. The
          increased prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> ranges from a modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> for
          systemic lupus erythematosus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. This tendency toward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoimmunity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> is often ascribed to hormonal
          differences, because in a number of experimental disease
          models <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">estrogens exacerbated disease</ENAMEX>, and androgens can
          inhibit disease activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. However, human studies
          have failed to demonstrate a clear-cut influence of
          hormonal environment on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> susceptibility to lupus
          or other autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. In addition, many
          childhood forms of autoimmunity, such as juvenile
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, exhibit female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
          Interestingly, juvenile (type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is an exception
          to this general trend, with a sex ratio close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in
          most studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to
          consider alternative explanations for the increased
          prevalence of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
          A unifying feature of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> appears to
          be the loss of immunologic tolerance to self-antigens,
          and in many of these diseases there is evidence that
          T-cell tolerance has been broken. The most profound form
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> tolerance involves deletion of potentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self-reactive T</ENAMEX> cells during thymic selection. Thus, lack
          of exposure to a self-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> in the thymus may lead to
          the presence of autoreactive T cells and may increase the
          risk of autoimmunity. An elegant example of this has
          recently been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          The existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
          offers a potential mechanism whereby X-linked
          self-antigens may escape presentation in the thymus or in
          other peripheral sites that are involved in tolerance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX>. Early in female development, one of the two X
          chromosomes in each cell undergoes an ordered process of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>, with subsequent silencing of most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on
          the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. This phenomenon occurs at
          a very early embryonic stage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], and thus all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
          are mosaic and may occasionally exhibit extreme skewing
          towards one or the other parental <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. In
          theory, this may result in a situation in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">polymorphic</ENAMEX> self-antigens on one <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome may fail to
          be expressed at sufficiently high levels in a tolerizing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, such as the thymus, and yet may be expressed
          at a considerable frequency in the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">soma</ENAMEX>. Thus,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> may be predisposed to a situation in which they
          can occasionally express <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens in the
          periphery to which they have been inefficiently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerized</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewart</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] has recently speculated that
          such a mechanism may play a role in the predisposition to
          systemic lupus.
          This hypothesis predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with
          autoimmunity may be particularly prone to this mechanism
          of `inadequate tolerization' by virtue of extremely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skewed X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation. We therefore performed
          a comprehensive analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation
          patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX>, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, and type 1 (insulin-dependent)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>, and in female control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The
          results do not provide support for a major role for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skewed X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation in female predisposition
          to autoimmunity; however, neither is the underlying
          hypothesis disproved by the present data.
        
        
          Materials and method
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was obtained from female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> seen
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Mason Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> Hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Sclerosis Center</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          with systemic lupus erythematosus seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Surgery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with juvenile
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX>
          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> healthy
          age-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were studied as normal controls.
          Employing a modification of previously described
          methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], we utilized a fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa II/PCR</ENAMEX> assay
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen receptor</ENAMEX> (AR) locus to assess
          X-chromosome inactivation patterns. The AR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> contains
          a polymorphic CAG repeat, which is flanked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa II</ENAMEX>
          sites. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are methylated on the inactive
          X chromosome, and are unmethylated on the active X
          chromosome. By performing PCR amplification across this
          region after cutting with the methylation-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enzyme Hpa II</ENAMEX>, the relative amounts of the methylated AR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> can be quantitatively determined with a high
          degree of accuracy; variance on repeated assays is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Skewing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation is expressed as
          percentage deviation from equal (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX>) inactivation of
          the upper and lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> alleles. Therefore, the maximal
          possible deviation is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, in which case all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosomes bearing one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> alleles are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Results
          We examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation patterns in
          several different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The results are summarized
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A wide range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation skewing was
          observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">197</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> exhibited extreme skewing (greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> deviation from a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX> distribution). However,
          there was no difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, either in the
          overall mean skewing, or in the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          with extreme skewing (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>).
          Although the present study was not initiated in order
          to examine allelic variation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene 
          per se , the data provide an
          opportunity to address this question. Excessively long
          CAG repeats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> are a rare cause of spinal-bulbar
          muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> repeat length appears to
          have an influence on the biology of certain tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. In this context, it has been shown that
          transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> correlates inversely with repeat
          length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. We therefore compared AR repeat length in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with autoimmunity. No
          differences were observed for mean repeat length, or for
          maximum and minimum repeat length, among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Discussion
          The reason for the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> in most
          autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> remains obscure. The present study
          was initiated in order to address the hypothesis that a
          nonhormonal mechanism related to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> inactivation might be
          involved. The hypothesis rests on the idea that skewing
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation might lead to a deficiency of tolerance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in the thymus, particularly with respect to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymorphic X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens. The hypothesis
          predicts that skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation would be more
          prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> than in
          female control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. This was not observed.
          Nevertheless, these negative data do not rule out a
          role for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predisposition</ENAMEX> to loss
          of tolerance. A general model for how this mechanism
          might operate is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Thymocytes undergo
          selection in the thymic parenchyma and, in the case of
          negative selection, the selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> appear to be
          derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> and consist mainly of thymic
          dendritic cells. If the thymic dendritic cell population
          exhibits random <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation, it is highly likely that
          differentiating thymocytes will contact dendritic cells
          that express self-antigens on both <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes. This
          situation is outlined schematically on the left side of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. However, if there is extremely skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          inactivation in the thymic dendritic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, a
          particular thymocyte might not come into contact with
          dendritic cells that express one of the two X
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chormosomes</ENAMEX>. This would lead to a situation where T cells
          may undergo thymic maturation without having been
          negatively selected for antigens that are expressed on
          the predominantly inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. This situation
          is shown on the right side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          In order for this mechanism to be physiologically
          relevant, some assumptions must be made. First, defective
          tolerance from skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation should only be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> antigens that are polymorphic, and
          for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is heterozygous. Thus, this
          mechanism would not be expected to lead to lack of
          tolerance commonly, unless there are at least several
          highly polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that are involved in thymic deletion events.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, if this actually leads to autoimmunity, it also
          predicts that the initial break in tolerance that leads
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should involve an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigen that is
          expressed in a peripheral nontolerizing site or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circumstance</ENAMEX>.
          A recent report [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] has elegantly demonstrated the
          importance of thymic deletion events in predisposition to
          autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The proteolipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (PLP)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantigen</ENAMEX> is expressed in alternatively spliced forms,
          which exhibit tissue specific expression. A nonspliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> is expressed in peripheral neural tissue.
          However, in the thymus a splice variant results in the
          lack of thymic expression of an immunodominant peptide.
          This results in loss of tolerace of T cells to this
          peptide, presumably on the basis of lack of thymic
          deletion of thymocytes that are reactive with this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> is encoded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromsome</ENAMEX>. However, there is no evidence that genetic
          polymorphisms control the level splicing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> within
          the thymus. Nevertheless, these data illustrate the
          potential importance of deficiencies in thymic deletion
          for autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">T-cell reactivity</ENAMEX>.
          The present results suggest that if skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> is relevant to thymic tolerance induction,
          then the effect does not depend on global skewing of
          X-chromosome inactivation, at least in the hematopoietic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>. In this study we examined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation
          patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the
          results should reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in all
          mesenchymal tissues, including dendritic cells. X
          inactivation occurs at a very early time point in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and thus the results in one tissue should
          reflect the general situation in the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
          However, there may be exceptions to this. We have
          occasionally observed differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>-inactivation
          patterns between buccal mucosa (an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectodermally</ENAMEX> derived
          tissue) and peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the same individiual
          (unpublished observations). This could be a chance event,
          or it may result from selection for certain X-linked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> during embryonic development, as has been
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunodeficiencies</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>].
          Another consideration is that certain tissue
          microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> cells, and thus may exhibit skewed utilization
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, even if the tissue as a
          whole is not skewed. This situation could vary over time.
          Thus, there may be time points at which certain thymic
          microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that,
          for stochastic reasons, all utilize the same X
          chromosome. This would create a `window of opportunity'
          in which a given thymocyte, in a given selecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, could escape negative selection by antigens on
          the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. The likelihood of this
          happening would obviously depend on the number of
          dendritic cells that are usually contacted by a thymocyte
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymic</ENAMEX> selection. There is limited information on
          this point, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewart</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] has theorized that
          this number may be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as 15</NUMEX>. If this is the case,
          then escape from thymic deletion may still occur in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> who are heterozygous for a relevant X-linked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>, even if the hematopoietic cells in general do
          not exhibit extreme skewing.
          In conclusion, we suggest that X-chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> needs to be considered as a potential factor
          in the predominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in most autoimmune
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Our inability to show an increase in
          X-chromosome skewing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmunity does
          not eliminate this as an etiologic contributor to loss of
          immunologic tolerance. Future experiments must be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> at a detailed analysis of tissue patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>, as well as at a search for potential
          X-linked autoantigens.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        A reduction in the sex ratio (male : female) is
        characteristic of most autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. The increased
        prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> ranges from a modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> for multiple
        sclerosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> for systemic lupus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythematosus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. This tendency towards autoimmunity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX> is often ascribed to hormonal differences because,
        in a number of experimental disease models, estrogens
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exacerbate disease</ENAMEX> and androgens can inhibit disease
        activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. However, human studies have failed to
        demonstrate a clear-cut influence of hormonal environment
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> susceptibility to lupus or other autoimmune
        disorders. In addition, many childhood forms of
        autoimmunity, such as juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>,
        exhibit female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Interestingly, juvenile
        (type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is an exception to this general trend,
        with a sex ratio close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in most studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Therefore, it is reasonable to consider alternative
        explanations for the increased prevalence of autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        A unifying feature of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> appears to be
        the loss of immunologic tolerance to self-antigens, and in
        many of these diseases there is evidence that T-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tolerance</ENAMEX> has been broken. The most profound form of T-cell
        tolerance involves deletion of potentially self-reactive T
        cells during thymic selection. Thus, lack of exposure to a
        self-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> in the thymus may lead to the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoreactive T</ENAMEX> cells and increase the risk of autoimmunity.
        An elegant example of this has recently been reported [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>].
        The existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        offers a potential mechanism whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">X-linked</ENAMEX> self-antigens
        may escape presentation in the thymus or in other
        peripheral sites that are involved in tolerance induction.
        Early in female development, one of the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes
        in each cell undergoes an ordered process of inactivation,
        with subsequent silencing of most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        chromosome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. This phenomenon occurs at a very early
        embryonic stage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], and thus all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are mosaic and
        may occasionally exhibit extreme skewing towards one or the
        other parental <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. In theory, this may result in
        a situation in which polymorphic self-antigens on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X</ENAMEX>
        chromosome may fail to be expressed at sufficiently high
        levels in a tolerizing compartment, such as the thymus, and
        yet may be expressed at considerable frequency in the
        peripheral soma. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> may be predisposed to a
        situation in which they can occasionally express X-linked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantigens</ENAMEX> in the periphery to which they have been
        inefficiently tolerized. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewart</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] has recently
        speculated that such a mechanism may play a role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX> to systemic lupus.
        This hypothesis predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmunity
        may be particularly prone to this mechanism of `inadequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerization</ENAMEX>' by virtue of extremely skewed X-chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>. We therefore performed a comprehensive
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation patterns in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, systemic
        lupus, juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>, and type 1
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">insulin-dependent</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, and in female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The results do not provide support for
        a major role for skewed X-chromosome inactivation in female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX> to autoimmunity; however, neither is the
        underlying hypothesis disproved by our data.
      
      
        Materials and method
        
          Subjects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was obtained from female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> seen
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Mason Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> Hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Sclerosis Center</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          with systemic lupus erythematosus seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Surgery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with juvenile
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX>
          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> healthy
          age-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were studied as normal controls.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hpa II</ENAMEX>/polymerase chain reaction assay for
          X-chromosome inactivation
          A modification to a previously described assay for AR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] was used for these studies. In the
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene is methylated on the inactive
          X chromosome and is undermethylated on the active X
          chromosome. Furthermore, the presence of a highly
          polymorphic triplet repeat within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene allows for
          the discrimination of each <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome in most female
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, allele-specific methylation
          patterns can be distinguished using this gene.
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 200 ng</TIMEX>) was digested
          overnight using a methylation-sensitive restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enzyme HpaII</ENAMEX>, as per the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). A mock sample as control
          was prepared simultaneously without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HpaII</ENAMEX> enzyme.
          After the digestion the samples were boiled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min to</TIMEX>
          inactivate the enzyme. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification was performed,
          with final concentration of the digest equivalent to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> ng of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Ã—</NUMEX> PCR bufferII

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and amplitaq gold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> used were AR1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-TCCAGAATCTGTTCCA-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAGCGTGC-3</ENAMEX>') and AR2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-GCTGTGAAGGTTGCT-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTTCCTCAT-3</ENAMEX>'). These primers flank
          the triple repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">HpaII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the first
          exon of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AR1</NUMEX> primer was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX> labeled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fam and TET</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-Fam</ENAMEX>-AR1
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TET-AR1</ENAMEX> were used for mock and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HpaII</ENAMEX>-digested
          samples, respectively. This combination allowed
          simultaneous analyses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HpaII</ENAMEX>-
          and mock-treated samples using the ABI310 Genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analyzer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX>). The final concentration of the
          AR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 pmol</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-Fam-AR1</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> pmol unlabelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AR1</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 pmol of unlabeled AR2</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction.
          The cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95Â°C/12</NUMEX> min to activate the amplitaq <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, followed by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of denaturation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95Â°C/45</NUMEX> s, annealing at
          60Â°C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/30</NUMEX> s and extension at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72Â°C/30</NUMEX> s. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>,
          the final extension was done at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72Â°C/10</NUMEX> min. The PCR
          products of each sample (mock and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HpaII</ENAMEX>) were diluted
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX> in the same vial. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> microliter of the diluted
          product was then added to a mixture containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          deionized formamide and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼l molecular weight standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">350 TAMRA</ENAMEX>.The vials were denatured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95Â°C/5</NUMEX> min,
          cooled on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, and resolved using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310</NUMEX> Genetic Analyzer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Calculations for percentage of skewing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          inactivation
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX> peaks corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were obtained
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Analyzer</ENAMEX> for each mock- and
          HpaII-treated sample. The relative intensity of the
          larger AR allele (higher molecular weight, peak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) with
          respect to the smaller AR allele (low molecular weight,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">peak 1</ENAMEX>) was calculated and expressed as the ratio <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> (peak
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> area/peak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> area). The ratios in the mock-digested (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HpaII</ENAMEX>-digested (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were calculated
          separately, and were then averaged for each of the two
          sets of duplicate samples. For each individual, a
          normalized ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N = R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H /R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ) was calculated to correct for
          occasional minor variation in efficiency of amplification
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> alleles. This normalized ratio was used to
          determine the percentage of inactivation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosome bearing the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AR</ENAMEX> allele: percentage
          inactivation = [R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N /</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)] <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã— 100</NUMEX>. The degree of skewing
          was calculated by subtracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> from the observed degree
          of inactivation.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluorescent Hpa II</ENAMEX>/polymerase chain reaction assay
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation
          Employing a modification of previously described
          methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], we utilized a fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa II/PCR</ENAMEX> assay
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> locus to assess X-chromosome inactivation
          patterns. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> contains a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic</ENAMEX> CAG repeat that is flanked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa</ENAMEX> II sites.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hpa</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are methylated on the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosome, and are unmethylated on the active X
          chromosome. By performing PCR amplification across this
          region after cutting with the methylation-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enzyme Hpa II</ENAMEX>, the relative amounts of the methylated AR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> can be quantitatively determined with a high
          degree of accuracy; variance on repeated assays is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples of this assay are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a, an individual with equivalent methylation of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> alleles is shown. In this case, the relative peak
          intensity is equivalent in the mock-digested and Hpa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>-digested samples. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b, an individual with
          extremely skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation is shown, in whom the
          lower allele (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">271 bp</ENAMEX>) is relatively over-methylated
          compared with the upper (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">284 bp</ENAMEX>) allele. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosome bearing the lower allele is preferentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated</ENAMEX>. As described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and method
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, all assays were normalized to the mock results
          and performed in duplicate. Skewing of X-chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> is expressed as a percentage deviation from
          equal (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX>) inactivation of the upper and lower AR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the maximal possible deviation is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, in which case all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome bearing one of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> alleles are inactivated.
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation patterns in
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmune
          diseases
          We examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation patterns in
          several different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The results are summarized
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A wide range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation skewing was
          observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">197</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> exhibited extreme skewing (greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> deviation from a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX> distribution). However,
          there was no difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, either in the
          overall mean skewing, or in the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          with extreme skewing (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor gene</ENAMEX> allele size comparisons
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls
          Although the present study was not initiated to
          examine allelic variation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene 
          per se , the data provide an
          opportunity to address this question. Excessively long
          CAG repeats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are a rare cause of
          spinal-bulbar muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> repeat
          length appears to have an influence on the biology of
          certain tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. In this context, it has been
          shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] that transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> gene correlates
          inversely with repeat length.We therefore compared AR
          repeat length in control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoimmunity</ENAMEX>. No differences were observed for mean
          repeat length, or for maximum and minimum repeat length,
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The reason for the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> in most
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> remains obscure. The present study was
        initiated in order to address the hypothesis that a
        nonhormonal mechanism related to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> inactivation might be
        involved. The hypothesis rests on the idea that skewing of
        X inactivation might lead to a deficiency of tolerance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in the thymus, particularly with respect to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymorphic X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> predicts
        that skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation would be more prevalent in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> than in female control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. This was not observed.
        Nevertheless, these negative data do not rule out a role
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predisposition</ENAMEX> to loss of
        tolerance. A general model for how this mechanism might
        operate is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Thymocytes undergo selection in
        the thymic parenchyma, and in the case of negative
        selection, the selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> appear to be derived from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> and consist mainly of thymic dendritic
        cells. If the thymic dendritic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> exhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random X</ENAMEX> inactivation, it is highly likely that
        differentiating thymocytes will contact dendritic cells
        that express self-antigens on both <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes. This
        situation is outlined schematically on the left side of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. However, if there is extremely skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        inactivation in the thymic dendritic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, a
        particular thymocyte may not come into contact with
        dendritic cells that express one of the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes.
        This would lead to a situation where T cells may undergo
        thymic maturation without having been negatively selected
        for antigens that are expressed on the predominantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">inactive X</ENAMEX> chromosome. This situation is shown on the right
        side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        In order for this mechanism to be physiologically
        relevant, several assumptions must be made. First,
        defective tolerance from skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation should only
        be directed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> antigens that are polymorphic, and
        for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is heterozygous. Thus, this
        mechanism would not be expected to commonly lead to lack of
        tolerance unless there are at least several highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymorphic X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that
        are involved in thymic deletion events. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, if this
        actually leads to autoimmunity, it also predicts that the
        initial break in tolerance that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should
        involve an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigen that is expressed in a
        peripheral nontolerizing site or circumstance.
        A recent report [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] elegantly demonstrated the
        importance of thymic deletion events in predisposing to
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> autoantigen is expressed in
        alternatively spliced forms, which exhibit tissue-specific
        expression. A nonspliced variant is expressed in periperal
        neural tissue. However, in the thymus a splice variant
        results in the lack of thymic expression of an
        immunodominant peptide. This results in loss of tolerace of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells to this peptide, presumably on the basis of lack of
        thymic deletion of thymocytes that are reactive with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> is encoded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromsome.
        However, there is no evidence that genetic polymorphisms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the level splicing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX> within the thymus.
        Nevertheless, these data illustrate the potential
        importance of deficiencies in thymic deletion for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">autoimmune T-cell</ENAMEX> reactivity.
        The present results suggest that if skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX> is relevant to induction of thymic tolerance,
        then the effect does not depend on global skewing of
        X-chromosome inactivation, at least in the hematopoietic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>. In this study we examined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation
        patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the
        results should reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in all
        mesenchymal tissues, including dendritic cells. X
        inactivation occurs at a very early time point in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and thus the results in one tissue should
        reflect the general situation in the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
        However, there may be exceptions to this. We have
        occasionally observed differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation
        patterns between buccal mucosa (an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectodermally</ENAMEX> derived
        tissue) and peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (mesoderm) in the same
        individual (unpublished observations). This could be a
        chance event, or may result from selection for certain
        X-linked alleles during embryonic development, as has been
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunodeficiencies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        However, in general, subsets of cells within the
        hematopoietic compartment do not display differences in
        X-inactivation patterns (unpublished observations).
        Another consideration is that certain tissue
        microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers of
        founder cells, and thus may exhibit skewed utilization of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, even if the tissue as a
        whole is not skewed. This situation could vary over time.
        Thus, there may be time points at which certain thymic
        microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that,
        for stochastic reasons, all utilize the same <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome.
        This would create a `window of opportunity' in which a
        given thymocyte, in a given selecting location, could
        escape negative selection by antigens on the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        chromosome. The likelihood of this happening would
        obviously depend on the number of dendritic cells that are
        usually contacted by a thymocyte during thymic selection.
        There is limited information on this point, although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewart</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] has theorized that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> may be as low
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. If this is the case, escape from thymic deletion may
        still occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> who are heterozygous for a relevant
        X-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, even if the hematopoietic cells in
        general do not exhibit extreme skewing.
        If the latter scenario is operative, it will be
        extremely difficult to document it by studying
        X-inactivation patterns. One might examine <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skewing</ENAMEX> specifically in thymic dendritic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, but
        if the effect is at the level of microenvironment and
        varies over time, then it will not be possible to detect
        this using methods directed at large cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, as
        we have done here. Conceivably, examination of thymic
        tissue sections could provide support for the hypothesis.
        Another aspect of this is that some thymic deletion events
        appear to be mediated by thymic epithelial cells at the
        cortico-medullary junction. Interestingly, thymic
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appear to be derived from very few founder
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and thus should exhibit a rather large degree
        of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patchiness</ENAMEX>' with respect to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> inactivation. This again
        might lead to local epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> microenvironments that
        fail to delete for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens.
        It has recently become apparent that mechanisms of
        peripheral tolerance also exist, and we have considered the
        possibility that skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in a peripheral
        tolerizing compartment might also lead to inefficient
        tolerance. A major mechanism of peripheral tolerance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> appears to involve the recognition of tolerizing
        antigens by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">costimulation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        This may specifically occur in the paracortical regions of
        lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, without further progression of the tolerized T
        cells into lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node follicles</ENAMEX>. Because this mechanism
        presumably involves circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, it is difficult to
        invoke a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>-inactivation skewing in altering this
        process, unless the skewing were virtually complete.
        Tolerance induction by parenchymal tissue has also been
        described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], and may be a multistage process that is
        still not entirely understood. Conceivably, skewed
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens could play a role here,
        but this would require invoking a peripheral tolerizing
        compartment that is limiting with respect to the dosage of
        tolerizing cells to which peripheral T cells can be
        exposed. No such compartment has yet been defined.
        In conclusion, we suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> inactivation
        needs to be considered as a potential factor in the
        predominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in most autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Our
        inability to show an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">X-chromosome</ENAMEX> skewing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with autoimmunity does not eliminate this as an
        etiologic contributor to loss of immunologic tolerance.
        Future experiments must be directed at detailed analysis of
        tissue patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation, as well as at a search
        for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">X-linked</ENAMEX> autoantigens.
