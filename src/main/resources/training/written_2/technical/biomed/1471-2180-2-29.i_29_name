        Genetic heterogeneity is a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C virus</ENAMEX> (HCV) in particular, due
        to the lack of fidelity of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>, this genetic diversity has
        been organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> major genotypes and numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 80</NUMEX>). Isolates of the same genotype have an
        average DNA sequence identity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>, but different
        genotypes have DNA sequence identity close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> on
        average [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Nucleic acid-based assays, such as the polymerase chain
        reaction (PCR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR), nucleic
        acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), branched chain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (</ENAMEX>bDNA) and sequence analysis itself, rely on the
        efficient hybridization of oligonucleotides to the targeted
        sequence. Mismatches between the oligonucleotides and the
        targeted nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> can affect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> stability and may
        compromise the ability of a system to amplify and detect
        the targeted sequences. Numerous factors determine the
        effect of mismatches, including: the length of the
        oligonucleotide, the nature and position of the mismatches,
        the temperature of hybridization, the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> and the concentrations of oligonucleotides, as
        well as monovalent and divalent cations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        The sequence heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HCV</ENAMEX> challenges efficient
        detection with nucleic acid-based assays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is widely
        used for the detection of HCV specific nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> due to
        its sensitivity. Generally speaking however, effective
        primers require the genotype of the sample to be known in
        advance and even then will often be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 100%</NUMEX>
        effective due to minor variations in the isolates.
        Design of robust primers to maximize success with
        unsequenced isolates ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e</ENAMEX> . clinical samples), is a common
        challenge facing the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virologists</ENAMEX>. A number of
        software products exist to facilitate primer selection with
        defined genomes. Many factors are considered in these
        programs, for example, melting temperature of primers,
        avoiding primer dimers, avoiding self-complementary primers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">etc</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Primer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Premier</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Primer3</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PRIDE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] ). These algorithms deal mostly with a single template or
        a small number of sequences. Little effort has been made to
        handle large number of heterogeneous variants of a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
        A large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> related sequences have been
        deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, making genome wide comparison of all
        different HCV genotypes and subtypes possible. In this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> complete and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> partial sequences
        deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 129</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 15, 2002</TIMEX>) have
        been used to generate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a genome</NUMEX> wide consensus sequence and
        Position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weight Matrix</ENAMEX> (PWM) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> genome. A PWM
        based approach for identifying highly conserved regions is
        proposed which should aid in robust primer design for
        nucleic acid-based assays. This approach is general enough
        to be used to optimize any set of genomes with a high
        degree of heterogeneity.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Aligning genomes and generating a position weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>(PWM)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> genome (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D90208</NUMEX>) was used as a template and was
          separated into pieces based on known gene boundaries. All
          complete and partial sequences that contained a given
          region were collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>
          sequences from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> non-redundant nucleotide
          sequence database (nt). An alignment was then made for
          each part of the genome using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . A weight
          score for each position in each fragment was calculated
          and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX> was created for that fragment. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A whole</TIMEX> genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX> was created by joining the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWMs</ENAMEX>. Finally a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-bp window, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a typical primer), was
          walked through the genome<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/PWM</ENAMEX> to identify the most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">conserved</ENAMEX> locations for primer design.
          Due to the extreme genetic heterogeneity of the HCV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and the nature and large number of complete and
          partial sequences in the public database, a direct genome
          wide sequence alignment was not feasible. The approach
          taken, to break the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> genome into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pieces according
          to the gene boundaries, proved to be successful. HCV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence D90208</ENAMEX> was chosen arbitrarily as the template
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and the number of sequences included for
          alignment of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> genome share only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>
          identity across strains. Figure 1shows a plot of
          conservation score using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-bp window for the whole HCV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Region 1-350</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is
          very conserved across all strains while region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860-2230</TIMEX>
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2 protein</ENAMEX>, is very heterogeneous.
          In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position wobble causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mismatching</ENAMEX> at
          virtually every <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> base (in the coding region),
          leading as expected, to less identity at the DNA level [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . In the process of collecting sequences for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HCV</ENAMEX> region, using a nucleotide level comparison algorithm
          like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX>, a lot of sequence entries will be missed. To
          solve this problem, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level comparison algorithm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> was used via a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-frame translation. Different
          stringency scores were used to ensure that as many
          sequences as possible were retrieved. A sequence was
          chosen for alignment (for a given region) if it shared at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identity over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> stretch or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX>
          identity over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> stretch, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90%</NUMEX>
          identity over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> stretch with the template
          sequence. These cutoffs were chosen following inspection
          of the blast hits for the different regions. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 4.9%</NUMEX> of
          the available sequences were discarded due to failure to
          meet the aforementioned criteria.
          For each regional alignment, flanking sequences were
          trimmed prior to generating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX>. The genome wide PWM
          was created by combining all individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWMs</ENAMEX> (see
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insertions</ENAMEX> (represented by '-' in
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were added to the template sequence
          only if greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the sequences contained this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>. This was done to reduce the inclusion of
          spurious insertions that are caused by sequencing errors
          or that exist in only a single isolate. A consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was derived by picking the most frequently
          occurring base at each position.

          Choosing a conserved region for optimized primer
          design
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX>, the most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> stretches were
          rapidly identified making possible the design of robust
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> based on the criteria described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>. The
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25-bp</TIMEX> segments in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and Table 3are</ENAMEX> listed by
          positions in the genome. The higher the odds score, the
          more conserved the region. Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2shows samples</ENAMEX> from the
          final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 10</NUMEX>-bp region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS5B</TIMEX> has a very low
          conservation score (A), a second <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-bp <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> shows a
          very high conservation score (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). This approach allows
          rapid identification of the most conserved regions of the
          genome with no regard for self-complementarity of
          primers, optimizing melting temperature, avoiding primer
          dimers, etc. Once potential regions of interest are
          identified, other primer design algorithms can then be
          used to ensure that self-complementarity etc. will not be
          a problem. This <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> step strategy for designing robust
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> can be applied to any set of genomes with a high
          degree of heterogeneity such as viruses, bacterial genes
          etc. Once a specific sequence has been identified,
          partially degenerate or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> can
          easily be generated as deemed appropriate for the
          particular application. Empirical validation of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> is still prudent.

          was used to determine whether or not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences share

          sequence alignment. All non-commercial softwares used in
          this study were written in PERL <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Construction of alignment
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> related sequences were extracted from GenBank
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 129</ENAMEX>) by using keyword <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. D90208
          was chosen as the organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> for its fully
          annotated genome in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>. (Other organizing HCV
          genomes yielded virtually identical consensus sequences
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX> profiles.) The genomes were separated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          regions according to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D90208</TIMEX>'s annotation: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, core,
          E1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P7</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS4A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS4B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS5A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NS5B</TIMEX>. The DNA
          sequences for each of these regions were retrieved and
          used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> analysis against all HCV sequences. If a
          sequence shared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identity over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-bp (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> identity over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-bp (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> over
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-bp</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) with the query template region, it
          was considered to contain part of the corresponding gene
          from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> genome in that region, and therefore was used
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sequences</ENAMEX> alignments of this region. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, a multiple alignment was done using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX>. Alignment was manually curated to eliminate
          obvious false alignments due to bad sequence quality or
          inappropriate BLAST hits.
        
        
          Construction of PWM
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX> and a consensus sequence were built for each
          region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> and subsequently assembled into a whole
          genome consensus sequence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWM</ENAMEX>. For each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          regions, the number of occurrences of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> at a
          given position was compiled. These counts were converted
          to frequencies that were used to calculate log odds
          scores. The odds score is the frequency observed divided
          by the theoretical frequency expected ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, the background frequency of
          the base, usually averaged over the genome ~<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.25/base</ENAMEX>).
          For example, if the base frequency is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX> and the
          estimated background frequency is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>, the odds score
          would be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.79/0.25</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.16</NUMEX>. Finally, odds scores were
          converted to log odds scores by taking the logarithm base
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> 
          i,<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">j</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (F 
          i,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">j /P</ENAMEX> 
          i, )
          Where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> 
          i,j is the scoring matrix value of
          base i in position j
          F 
          i,j is the frequency of base i in
          position j, P 
          i is the background frequency of base
          i
          As the logarithm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> is infinity, a zero
          occurrence of a particular base in the matrix creates a
          problem. In this case, a large negative log odds score
          may be used at such a position in a scoring matrix. A
          formula proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] was used
          instead in our calculations.

          i,<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">j</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [(C

          i,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">j /P</ENAMEX> 
          i, )
          Where C 
          i,j is the count of base i in position
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the total number of sequences.
        
        
          Choosing a conserved region for primer
          design
          By sliding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> bp window (representing average primer
          length) incrementally along the genome in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-bp intervals,
          an average of the highest log odds scores for each
          position (either A, C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) was calculated to generate
          the overall degree of conservation (conservation score)
          for this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-bp region.
          
          where L is the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-bp in this
          case).
          For PCR applications (or those involving
          polymerization, where homology at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> is most critical), it is recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end and the penultimate position be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or C with
          frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â‰¥0.98</NUMEX>. It is also beneficial if the
          previous position (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or C with a frequency of
          â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‰¥0.90</NUMEX> or alternatively, an A or T with a frequency of
          â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‰¥0.95</NUMEX>. Regions that contain insertions, should in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, be avoided.
