        Acute pain has been studied in single dose designs first
        proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beecher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] and formalized
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallenstein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The problem with single
        trials is that while they can demonstrate statistical
        superiority of analgesic over placebo, variation because of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> chance means that, if small, they provide a poor
        estimate of the size of the analgesic effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Combining results from clinically homogeneous trials in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis gives an accurate estimate of the extent of
        the analgesic effect when sufficient numbers of patients
        have been randomized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Clinical trials in acute pain normally last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four to six</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, because that is the duration of effect for most
        analgesics, whether injected or as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>, and for simple
        analgesics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> or opioids. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meta</ENAMEX>-analysis in acute pain
        has concentrated on the use of the area under the total
        pain relief versus time curve (TOTPAR), dichotomized into
        at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> pain relief or not [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It is not
        necessarily the only measure available or the most
        relevant. The precedent exists at a primary research level
        for adopting remedication as an outcome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullingham</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] explored the
        measure of re-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> in post-surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> subject
        to multiple dosing. A 'rescue factor' design was refined to
        demonstrate both analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">efficacy</ENAMEX> and assay sensitivity.
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] extrapolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-medication data in an effort to both define and
        demonstrate analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">efficacy</ENAMEX>.
        Despite these efforts, time to remedication has never
        become a standard outcome in analgesic trials. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason
        for this might simply be the similarity in duration between
        commonly used analgesics. For rofecoxib, this might be
        different. In <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">arthritis 12.5 mg or 25 mg</NUMEX> of rofecoxib is
        given as a single dose once a day to control pain. The
        acute pain dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg is claimed to have prolonged
        analgesic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis
        of rofecoxib in acute pain was threefold. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> to examine
        all acute pain studies of analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">efficacy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six hours</TIMEX> for comparison with other analgesics in acute
        pain. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> to examine the amount and quality of the
        evidence presented on extended duration of analgesia. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>
        to examine the quality and quantity of evidence on adverse
        events.
      
      
        Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUORUM</ENAMEX> guidelines were followed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Possible
        studies for inclusion were sought through searching the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane Library</ENAMEX> (issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 2001</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Abstracts</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2002</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2002</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PubMed</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2002</TIMEX>)
        using rofecoxib as a free text term. The search strategy
        used is detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>. Abstracts were
        examined for possible inclusion if they were randomized
        trials conducted in an acute pain setting, used rofecoxib
        and a placebo or active comparator. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reference</ENAMEX> lists and
        review articles were examined for possible additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, and in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> were also searched for
        papers.
        Criteria for inclusion for postoperative pain were: full
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> publication, randomized controlled trials which
        included single dose treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of oral rofecoxib and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>, double blind design, baseline postoperative pain
        of moderate to severe intensity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> of
        age, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the pain outcome
        measures of total pain relief (TOTPAR) or summed pain
        intensity difference (SPID) over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-6 hours</TIMEX> or sufficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to allow their calculation. Pain measures allowed for
        the calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOTPAR</ENAMEX> or SPID were a standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        point pain relief scale (none, slight, moderate, good,
        complete), a standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> point pain intensity scale
        (none, mild, moderate, severe) or a standard visual
        analogue scale (VAS) for pain relief or pain intensity.
        Also of interest was information on the time to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remedication</ENAMEX>. For adverse events, the primary outcome
        sought was the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing any
        adverse event, with secondary outcomes of patients
        experiencing particular adverse events. Although adverse
        events are often reported inconsistently in acute pain
        trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the outcome of any patient experiencing any
        adverse event was the least inconsistently reported.
        Each report which could possibly be described as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trial was read independently by at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and scored using a commonly-used three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">item, 1-5</ENAMEX> score, quality scale [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Consensus was then
        achieved. The maximum score of an included study was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and
        the minimum score was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX> were not blinded because
        they already knew the literature.
        For each trial, mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOTPAR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPID</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASTOTPAR</ENAMEX> or VASSPID
        values for each treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were converted to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>maxTOTPAR by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> into the calculated maximum value [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in each treatment group
        who achieved at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>maxTOTPAR was calculated using
        valid equations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . The number of patients
        randomized was taken as the basis for calculations, to
        produce an intention to treat analysis. The number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50%</NUMEX>maxTOTPAR was then used to
        calculate relative benefit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> for rofecoxib versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>. The same methods were used for adverse events.
        Relative benefit and relative risk estimates were
        calculated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals using a fixed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">effects</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterogeneity</ENAMEX> tests were not used as
        they have previously been shown to be unhelpful [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] ,
        though homogeneity was examined visually [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Publication bias was not assessed using funnel plots as
        these tests have been shown to be unhelpful [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . The
        number needed to treat or harm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX>) with
        confidence intervals was calculated by the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cook</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sackett</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] from the sum of all events and patients
        for treatment and placebo. Cumulative calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] was performed by adding studies by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of publication,
        and alphabetically within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.
        Relative benefit or risk was considered to be
        statistically significant when the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval
        did not include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> values were only calculated
        when the relative risk or benefit was statistically
        significant, and are reported with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
        interval. Calculations were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Macintosh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G4</ENAMEX>.

        Results
        
          At least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> pain relief
          All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> trials gave or allowed the calculation of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-hour</TIMEX> TOTPAR and the derivation of the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50%</NUMEX>maxTOTPAR. There was good
          agreement between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Overall
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252/464</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) given rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> had at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> maxTOTPAR over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24/211</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>) with placebo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> for one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to
          have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> pain relief over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0 to 2.6</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Cumulative meta-analysis of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> trials (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) shows that the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          interval of the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> fell within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">± 0.5 NNT</TIMEX> of
          the overall mean (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 to 2.8</NUMEX>) when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Remedication time
          Onset of analgesia with rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> appeared to be
          generally the same as with comparator analgesics. Trials
          tried to discourage remedication within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial were excluded because they
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remedicated</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on placebo and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on
          rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . This was not reported
          consistently ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 3</ENAMEX>). The percentage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients remedicating</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> was given in one
          study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , and within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 27</NUMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> study (.( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] gave cumulative remedication
          rates over the duration of the study. Median time to
          remedication was given in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 27 28</NUMEX> ] ,
          and this allowed the calculation of a mean of the three
          trials weighted by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For placebo
          the weighted mean time to remedication from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.9 hours</TIMEX>. For rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg the
          weighted mean time to remedication from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">322</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13.6 hours</TIMEX>. For ibuprofen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> mg the
          weighted mean time to remedication from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.4 hours</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Adverse events
          Adverse events were not reported consistently (
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> trials reported the proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> having any adverse event. An adverse event was
          reported by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on placebo and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of those
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rofecoxib</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 mg</NUMEX> (not significantly different, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Nausea and vomiting were reported separately in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dental</ENAMEX> trials, and both occurred significantly less
          frequently with rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg than with placebo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For both there were negative numbers needed to harm
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-12</NUMEX> respectively), showing that for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> given rofecoxib, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fewer was nauseous or
          vomited than with placebo. There were few events, though,
          with only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> nauseated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 27</NUMEX> who vomited
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials of rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> comparable with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          nauseated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 22</NUMEX> who vomited in the two
          trials of ibuprofen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> mg.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> included studies were of generally high
        reporting quality (quality scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX>), known to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with minimal reporting bias [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . They all
        had a placebo control, used standardized pain intensity and
        relief scores in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with established pain of
        moderate or severe intensity, and measured outcomes over at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least six hours</TIMEX>. The pain models, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> molar dental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX> and orthopaedic surgery, are commonly used in
        research and choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> does not appear to influence
        results in single-dose analgesic studies when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        able to take oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Comparison of
        rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg with other analgesics over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> is
        legitimate, because the same outcome was measured in the
        same way in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over the same period of time,
        and with same comparator.
        Compared with placebo, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50%</NUMEX> pain
        relief over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0 to 2.6</NUMEX>). Table 2collects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNTs</ENAMEX> for a number of common oral analgesics and
        intramuscular morphine from recent meta-analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 13</NUMEX> ]
        and unpublished updates of other published <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochrane</ENAMEX> reviews
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . Rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg is comparable with other doses
        of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> and intramuscular morphine.
        For rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg this may not fully reflect its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> compared with these other analgesics, because
        rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg may have a longer duration of action. In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> included trials duration was inconsistently
        reported, however, with median remedication times in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        trials (but without dispersion) and percentage remedicated
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials. This
        disparity in reporting allowed only the crudest analysis of
        weighted mean remedication time. This was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.9 hours</TIMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.4 hours</TIMEX> for ibuprofen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">400 mg and 13.6 hours</TIMEX> for
        rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg. The figures of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.4 hours</TIMEX> for ibuprofen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.9 hours</TIMEX> for placebo is in agreement with a larger
        unpublished analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barden et al</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        observations). The extended time to remedication for
        rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg may represent a real clinical advantage
        where the problem is not a lack of effective analgesics,
        but rather effective analgesics ineffectively delivered [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] , and given that using a relatively large dose has no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disadvantages</ENAMEX>.
        The efficacy of rofecoxib in these <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX> classical
        clinical analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> is in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> randomized
        comparisons of rofecoxib with placebo when given before the
        operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The
        methodological difficulties and lack of effect of
        preemptive analgesia have been pointed out previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] . In these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials additional difficulties were the
        large between-individual variation in morphine consumption
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and the use of a novel (unlicensed)
        syrup formulation of rofecoxib in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Lack of
        a demonstrable analgesic effect in preemptive studies does
        not negate a substantial postoperative effect when patients
        both have pain and can swallow.
        There was no consistent pattern of adverse event
        reporting in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> included trials. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> trials had
        information on any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with any adverse event (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), with no difference between rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg and placebo.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials information on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suffering nausea
        and vomiting was available, showing that these adverse
        events occurred less frequently with rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>. The amount of information (number of patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX>) was insufficient to make any authoritative
        statement about adverse events, or compare the adverse
        event profile of rofecoxib <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg in single doses with other
        single dose analgesics. Adverse events in single-dose
        studies are often poorly reported, and of limited value [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] .
        In clinical practice, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> are associated with acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with impaired renal function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] and with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
        a prior history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Acute renal
        failure after surgery occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> after
        major surgery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , though it is not clear how much of
        this is specifically due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX>. For coxibs,
        especially at high doses, similar caution should be used in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pre-existing renal</ENAMEX> or cardiac conditions as
        apply to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>. The slope of the adverse event
        dose-response may be steeper than for analgesia.
        These published reports were insufficiently detailed for
        calculation of numbers needed to treat for durations longer
        than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX>. Some information was available for TOTPAR
        calculated to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX>, but not in a dichotomous format.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOTPAR</ENAMEX> is not normally distributed, and mean values are not
        meaningful [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . For times <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than six hours</TIMEX>, and
        for duration of analgesia and adverse event profiles, more
        detailed information from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would be
        required.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Rofecoxib at a dose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard daily</TIMEX> dose
        for chronic pain is an effective single dose oral analgesic
        in acute pain. Limitations in trial reporting constrain
        conclusions about longer duration of analgesia and adverse
        event profile.
