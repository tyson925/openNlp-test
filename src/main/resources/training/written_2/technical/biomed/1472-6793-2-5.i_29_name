        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteorhodopsin</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">249</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid membrane protein</ENAMEX>
        native to several uncultured species of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³-proteobacteria</NUMEX>,
        which are a component of marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plankton</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Addition
        of retinal to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli expressing pR</ENAMEX> was shown to
        cause a reddish coloration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with an
        absorption maximum near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> nm. The pR contained in the
        bacterial membranes was shown to act as a light-activated
        proton pump, but only when retinal is present.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-resolved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">UV</ENAMEX>/vis studies at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 8</ENAMEX> also revealed that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein undergoes</ENAMEX> a photocycle, similar to that of wild
        type bacteriorhodopsin, but with a predominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        intermediate instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
        The bR photocycle has been characterized by
        spectroscopic methods as having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principal
        photointermediates: bR, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> Each intermediate
        has a distinct absorbance maximum; the most studied are bR
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">570 nm</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">412 nm</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">640 nm</NUMEX>) since these are the
        ones that can be produced in the highest concentration at
        physiological pH values. Monitoring of the absorbance at
        individual wavelengths after photoexcitation is used to
        determine the relative concentrations and decay times of
        each of these photointermediates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L â†’ M</ENAMEX> transition in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bR</ENAMEX> is characterized by the deprotonation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schiff</ENAMEX> base
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp-85</ENAMEX>, producing the distinctive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX> nm absorbance
        maximum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, and by so-called fast proton release, the
        ejection of a proton from a different (unknown) residue
        into the external medium on the ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-100 Î</NUMEX>¼s time scale,
        depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pH. Reprotonation of the Schiff base</ENAMEX> from
        Asp-96 occurs during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M â†’ N</ENAMEX> transition with an
        absorbance maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> â†’ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> transition
        involves the reprotonation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp-96</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> space.
        Like bR, pR consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> transmembrane Î±-helices
        that include in the membrane interior all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        conserved among archaeal rhodopsin proton pumps. In
        particular, analogues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp-85</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp96</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg-82</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lys</ENAMEX>-216
        of bR are present in pR. Conspicuously absent are analogues
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu-194</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu-204</ENAMEX> of bR. The latter, as well as
        Arg-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>, have been implicated in fast proton release. In
        particular, mutagenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu-194</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu-204</ENAMEX> in bR results
        in loss of fast proton release [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The absence of
        homologs for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in pR leaves open the question
        of whether it carries out fast H +release.
        Experiments described here demonstrate that pR does
        indeed undergo fast H +release, at least under elevated pH
        conditions that resemble somewhat those of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î³-proteobacteria</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> open ocean environment. We also
        demonstrate that there is a post-translational modification
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> cysteines when pR is
        expressed in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Both of these discoveries
        were made possible through purification methods for pR
        described herein.
      
      
        Results
        
          Purification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> was obtained in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> purity, assuming that values of
          Îµ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> and Îµ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">546</NUMEX> for pR are the same as for bR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubilized</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMPC/cholate/SDS</ENAMEX> mixtures at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (Îµ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">280</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.85</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4cm <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-1M -1and</NUMEX> Îµ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">551</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX> Ã— <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 4cm -1M -1</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          This assumption is actually expected to underestimate the
          purity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> produced, by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to ~20%</NUMEX>, since the pR we
          expressed has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> tryptophan and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, as
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> tryptophans and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> tyrosines in bR from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salinarum</ENAMEX>. The absorbance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contaminant proteins</ENAMEX> was
          assumed to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL solution. By using these
          assumptions, the relative concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be determined from the absorbance spectra of
          the various fractions (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The resulting purity
          values correlate well with those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomasie</ENAMEX>-stained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels (see below). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> extract of
          cholate-washed membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> starts out at a pR
          content of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w/w</ENAMEX>). The Phenylsepharose
          column increases the purity level to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> loss. The final purification step by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylapatite</ENAMEX> column chromatography produces <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pR</ENAMEX> with
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> purity and a further loss of ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>, i.e. the overall
          yield of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> column procedure was ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
          Relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> standards, the apparent molecular
          weight of bR is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> while the apparent molecular
          weights <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of pR-wt</NUMEX> and pR-TCM are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,000 and 31,000</NUMEX>,
          respectively (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lanes E and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, respectively).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) also confirms the estimates of purity
          level based on the assumed Îµ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">280 /Îµ</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">546</NUMEX> ratio identical with that of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent solubilized bR</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the pR appears
          to be a doublet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> whose relative concentrations remain
          almost unchanged during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">purification</TIMEX>. This doublet is
          also present in the less-purified sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR-TCM</ENAMEX>, with
          both bands shifted down by approximately the same amount
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lane C).
          Subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR samples</ENAMEX> that had
          been stored for periods of time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to several months</TIMEX>
          indicate that after sitting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> in
          octylglucoside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, the largest
          post-translational modification on wild-type pR is
          eliminated - presumably hydrolysed off of the cysteine(s)
          - leaving only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,000</NUMEX>-MW band indistinguishable from
          that seen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR-TCM</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Furthermore, after
          boiling for several min in gel loading solution, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleaved</ENAMEX> wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCM</ENAMEX>, both give
          an extra artifactual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> near <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36,000 dalton</NUMEX>. The latter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">band</ENAMEX>, a singlet, is coincidentally at almost the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apparent MW</ENAMEX> as the doublet from the uncleaved
          post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">translationally</NUMEX>-modified wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lane
          E). These potential artifacts should be taken into
          consideration in any attempt to reproduce the results in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Photocycle kinetics and flash-induced proton
          concentration changes
          Photocycle kinetics were measured at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400, 500</ENAMEX>. and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX> in the presence of the short-chain lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHPC</ENAMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipid</ENAMEX> does not support the formation of closed bilayer
          vesicles, but rather forms micelles like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-resolved measurements showed no positive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-nm
          absorbance signals at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> or lower (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This is
          somewhat in disagreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©jÃ  et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , who
          detected small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-nm transient absorbance increases upon
          photolysis at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>. However, we observed a transient
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-nm absorbance increase at an elevated pH of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.5</NUMEX> (fig.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pH 9.5</NUMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX>, and observing
          transient changes at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 nm</NUMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), pR undergoes a
          2-phase decay after the initial unresolved absorbance
          decrease. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Multiexponential</ENAMEX> fits show that the first decay
          phase has a time constant of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼s</NUMEX>, in good agreement with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-Î¼s rise time of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nm signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
          amplitude of this decay represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80%</NUMEX> of the
          initial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">absorbance</ENAMEX> depletion. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          nm absorbance decay occurs with a substantially slower
          time constant of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> s, returning the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
          initial absorbance change. The slowest decay components
          of the positive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-nm signal and the negative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-nm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> follow similar kinetics, although the amplitudes
          of these components differ by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pH 9.5</NUMEX>,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX> nm trace has no significant positive values
          indicative of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-like intermediate, although, in
          agreement with earlier measurements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , at lower pH
          values a red-shifted transient is the predominant
          positive absorbance signal (data not shown).
          Figure 5shows a different type of time-resolved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, probing not the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR chromophore</ENAMEX>, but rather
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pH</ENAMEX> changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> environment. Proton
          concentration changes in the aqueous bulk phase were
          measured with the pH sensitive dye cresol red, which has
          a pK 
          a of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>. The bottom trace in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the absorbance change of the indicator
          during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pR photocycle</ENAMEX>. The negative signal is
          indicative of a pH decrease, corresponding to transient H
          +release from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> into the solution. The best-fit
          time constant for the release phase is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼s</NUMEX>. The positive
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nm trace in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>(reproduced from fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) shows that
          the proton release and uptake follow kinetics very
          similar to the apparent formation and decay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, as is
          typically seen in bR near neutral pH [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 21</NUMEX> ] .
          However, no proton release signal could be observed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 6</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8</NUMEX> (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Purification of pR
          Meaningful comparison of intrinsic physiological
          properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> and bR depends on the purification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> expression system can
          easily be used to prepare pR at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> purity with similar
          or less effort and time than required for bR (purple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>) production from S9 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> salinarum. 
          The initial purity level of the OG-solubilized
          cholate-extracted membrane is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7%</NUMEX> pR by weight.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenylsepharoseâ„¢</ENAMEX> column chromatography separates proteins
          on the basis of hydrophobicity, and has been used
          previously in hR purification [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . As an initial
          purification step, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phenylsepharoseâ„¢</ENAMEX> column achieved a
          substantial increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> purity to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, along with
          removal of most of the lipid. The final purification
          step, utilizing a hydroxylapatite column, has been
          previously used with rhodopsin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This column
          proved to be more efficient as a final step in the
          purification than as a preliminary one, because large
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contaminant protein</ENAMEX> tended to slow the flow
          rate drastically. This step of the purification yielded
          an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> purity to ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>. The overall
          yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> from membrane through the column
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purifications</ENAMEX> is ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>. Most of this loss, ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>, occurs
          during the hydroxylapatite column.
        
        
          Molecular weight differences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©jÃ  et al.</ENAMEX> reported a molecular weight for wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> kDa based on the predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">249</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> barely exceed
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX> of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bR</TIMEX>, which has a molecular weight of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX>. However, we observed a significantly higher
          apparent molecular weight (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~36,000</NUMEX>) for wild type pR on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). Post-translational
          modification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> must almost certainly account for some
          of the observed molecular weight difference between pR
          and bR. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipids</ENAMEX> or sugars covalently bound to the protein
          surface would not be removed during the purification
          procedure and could cause a higher apparent molecular
          weight. Cysteines are frequently a site of lipid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, (e.g. mammalian
          rhodopsin, which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> palmitoyl molecules attached to
          cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>). Therefore we compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          gel mobility of wild-type pR to that of a cys-less mutant
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR-TCM</ENAMEX>). The elimination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible
          sulfhydryl attachment sites lowers the apparent molecular
          weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR-TCM</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,000</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lane C). From
          this, we conclude that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteines</ENAMEX> in pR is probably modified
          post-translationally.
          However, this by itself does not account fully for the
          anomalous mobility of pR on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels, because pR-TCM
          is still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5,000</NUMEX> higher in molecular weight
          than bR according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">& C</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only ~2,600</NUMEX> of this can be accounted for by the V5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eiptope</ENAMEX> and poly-histidine tail that are appended to the
          C-terminus of pR by the pBAD-TOPO expression vector that
          we used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . There is undoubtedly a further
          post-translational modification of unknown nature.
        
        
          Spectral comparisons
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©jÃ  et al.</ENAMEX> reported an absorbance maximum for pR of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> nm in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> membranes, using a
          difference bleaching technique to remove interfering
          absorbance bands from other membrane components in the
          impure pR sample [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . We confirmed this result using
          crude 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli membranes</ENAMEX> without detergent
          present (data not shown). However, we observed an
          absorbance maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">546 Â± 5 nm</NUMEX> for pR in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> at
          all stages of purification (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Small blue shifts
          were observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR samples</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> when measured at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 8</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 and 16 nm</NUMEX>, respectively; data not shown).
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR samples reconstituted</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX>, which were
          used for flash <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">photolysis</ENAMEX> experiments, the absorbance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">maxima</ENAMEX> were similar to those measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> (spectra not
          shown). A chromophore absorption maximum near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> nm was
          also obtained by using difference spectroscopy of pR in
          crude 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli membranes solubilized</ENAMEX> in OG
          (spectrum not shown). However, for pR measured directly
          in crude 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> membranes, i.e. not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubilized</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX>, we obtained the same value (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">520 nm</NUMEX>) as
          reported previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solubilization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> presumably leads to
          structural distortions of the native protein
          conformation, and therefore a change in the absorbance
          properties of the chromophore. However, the direction
          that Î» 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> for pR would have to shift upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubilization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> is inconsistent with the pattern for
          bR, whose Î» 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> decreases when it is solubilized
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, pR in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> showed resonance

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raman spectra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> Dunmire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. A. Krebs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. S. Braiman</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data) indicative of a chromophore structure
          very close to native light-adapted (i.e. all-trans) bR in
          purple membrane. However, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major difference:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX> exhibits an upshifted, doublet C=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N Schiff</ENAMEX> base
          band consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX>-equal
          intensity. These appear to correspond to the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct subpopulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX>, at least when
          expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and solubilized in OG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micelles</ENAMEX>. The different values of Î» 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> for pR in membrane state [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OG</ENAMEX> solution might be related to the presence of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple subpopulations</ENAMEX>, but this connection remains
          unclear.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Principal photointermediates</ENAMEX> of pR
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principal photointermediates present in bR,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> can be discerned from the time-dependent visible
          absorbance traces from pR in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, along with
          previously published time traces at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] : the
          resting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pR</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> The resting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, with
          an absorbance maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">546 nm</NUMEX> (see above), provides the
          baseline spectrum for the difference time courses
          reported. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> intermediate of bR has an unprotonated
          Schiff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base group</ENAMEX>, giving rise to a blue-shifted Î» 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">400 nm</NUMEX>). Likewise in pR, an
          increase in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nm absorbance should indicate
          formation of a deprotonated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schiff</ENAMEX> base, and therefore
          the presence of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-like intermediate.
          Interpretation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nm time course trace is more
          complicated. As in bR, it likely involves decay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, as well as from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> back to bR. The absorbance maximum
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> intermediate in bR is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX> nm, corresponding to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protonated Schiff</ENAMEX> base. This is not very different from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>»
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> for the resting state of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">546</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>). The likely spectral overlap between pR and its own
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated N</ENAMEX> photoproduct complicates the determination
          of amounts of each that are present. The slow (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~500 ms</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decay</ENAMEX> observed in both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nm and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nm time courses
          indicates an equilibrium between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          intermediates that remains until pR returns to its
          initial resting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©jÃ  et al.</ENAMEX> reported a strong positive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX>-nm
          transient absorbance increase in suspensions of membranes
          prepared from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli expressing pR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This
          positive absorbance difference is indicative of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
          intermediate formation. We looked for its presence in
          partially-purified samples reconstituted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pH</ENAMEX> range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-11</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are shown only at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Our observations at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX> do not show any evidence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> intermediate formation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Only at lower pH
          values was a clear positive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX>-nm absorption change
          observed (data not shown). This is in agreement with
          results on bR, for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> formation is also enhanced at
          lower pH values, and becomes small or nearly unobservable
          in the alkaline range.
        
        
          Dependence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX> on pH
          Deprotonation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schiff</ENAMEX> base linkage of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retinal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys-216</ENAMEX> is dependent on its pK 
          a which changes between
          photointermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schiff</ENAMEX> base readily
          undergoes deprotonation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX>. However,
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> intermediate formation occurs below a pH of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>); instead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">O intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">predominates</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          . Predominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> at lower pH values is also observed
          in bR. However, in bR the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX> is detectable at
          low and high pHs, but has a longer lifetime at higher pH
          due to a long-lived equilibrium between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It seems likely that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediate of pR</ENAMEX> is similarly in equilibrium with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, based on the fact that the transient
          positive (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">400 nm</NUMEX>) absorbance increase is smaller than the
          negative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX>, and the time course at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nm
          shows a partial return to baseline on a timescale of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼s.</ENAMEX>
          The difference in pH dependence between the pR and bR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photocycles</ENAMEX> can likely be attributed to differences in
          the microenvironment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schiff</ENAMEX> base, and is perhaps
          related to absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Glu194/204</NUMEX> in pR. These adaptive
          differences presumably optimize the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to operate
          at maximum efficiency in the niches that their respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms occupy</ENAMEX>. In the case of the Î»-proteobacteria,
          which in the open ocean (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>) occupy a
          signficantly more alkaline environment than halobacteria,
          perhaps the proton-release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is simply not under any
          evolutionary pressure to be capable of deprotonating in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> state at neutral pH. In this view, the principal
          role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E194 and E204</TIMEX> in bR may to modulate the pK 
          a of the H +-release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          state to a value lower than the pH of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s
          external environment.
        
        
          Fast proton release in pR
          Under the same conditions where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> is observed (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>
          and in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX>), pR undergoes fast proton release during
          its photocycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The pH indicator dye <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cresol Red</ENAMEX>
          was used to detect pH changes in the bulk aqueous phase.
          These turn out to be similar to those observed for bR in
          the pH range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. After photoexcitation, pR (like bR,
          presumably) ejects a H +from a residue near its
          extracellular surface decreasing the pH of the solution.
          When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> â†’ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> transition takes place in bR, H +is taken
          up from the medium, raising the pH once again. The H
          +signals from pR measured with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cresol Red</ENAMEX> occur on a time
          scale similar to that assignable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> decay,
          returning to baseline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> s after photolysis.
          There is a clear kinetic correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> (and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) intermediate formation and fast H +release in pR. The
          linkage between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phenomena is further supported
          by the observation that neither a transient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-nm
          absorbance increase, nor fast H +release, is shown to
          occur at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> and below. Nor is either observed in the
          absence of a reconstituting lipid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX> in these
          experiments).
          In bR, the ejected proton is thought to originate from
          a triad of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R82-E194-E204</ENAMEX>. However, in pR a
          homolog of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX>) is present. This raises doubts about previous
          conclusions regarding the specific roles of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in fast H +proton release, in both pR and bR. In
          particular, the apparently obligatory roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E204</ENAMEX> and
          E194 in fast H +release in bR are not matched in pR.
          Therefore, even in bR it is less likely that these groups
          themselves change protonation state between bR and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> to
          provide the H +released to the bulk medium. Instead, it
          now seems more likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E204</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E194</NUMEX> merely help to
          lower the pK 
          a of the H +release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from above
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, the apparent value for pR, into the vicinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bR</ENAMEX>. It also seems very unlikely that the specific
          structural configuration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> carboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX> in bR could be conserved in pR, even if, as
          suggested previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , other surface carboxylic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in pR could substitute in some ways for the roles
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E194 and E204</TIMEX> in bR.
          The only way that the H +release mechanism can be
          strongly conserved between bR and pR is if arginine
          itself serves as the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor group</ENAMEX> for fast H
          +release in both, with nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E194</ENAMEX> and
          E204) merely modulating the pK 
          a of the arginine in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>. However, it remains unclear how the pK 
          a of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg-82</ENAMEX> in bR could be made
          sufficiently low in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX> to serve as the H
          +release <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at pH values down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>.
          Alternatively, it is possible that the fast H +release
          we observe from pR at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX> may differ from that in bR.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that in pR, the released proton could
          come directly from the chromophore counterion, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>.
          This would be consistent with a proposed mechanism for
          fast H +release that has been observed above pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in the
          bR mutant E194Q [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In this mutant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp-85</ENAMEX> was
          detected by low-temperature infrared difference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectroscopy</ENAMEX> to be deprotonated only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, and not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . It is not clear yet
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp-85</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">deprotonation</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> could
          account for the proton-release kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>),
          or whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX> itself might have a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">partially-deprotonated Asp</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>.
          The reason for the requirement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          intermediate formation and fast proton release is
          unclear. Delipidated bR in octylglucoside is fully
          capable of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> formation and presumably proton release,
          although with altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinetics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16</NUMEX> ] . The
          requirement for pR to be in lipid to show fast H +release
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> formation stems either from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>/lipid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> needed to establish a stable, active tertiary
          structure, or from the need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphate group</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPC</ENAMEX> to act as a proton release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The latter seems
          unlikely due to the DHPC molecule being zwitterionic at
          pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>, with no proton on the trimethyl-modified nitrogen
          of the choline. Hence, the DHPC most likely interacts
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to effect minor structural changes
          needed to place the active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">functional</ENAMEX> configuration.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        A comparison of the primary sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> and bR at
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance seems as to preclude fast H +release as part
        of the proton-pumping mechanism of pR due to the absence of
        residues analogous to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Glu194 and Glu 204</NUMEX> of bR. However,
        fast H +release is indeed observed in pR under conditions
        where an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M intermediate</ENAMEX> is formed. Glu194 and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Glu 204</ENAMEX> in bR
        play a role in fast H +release that is apparently not
        required for the mechanism of the bR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of proton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX>. It is therefore necessary to conclude that
        either the H +-release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in pR and bR are
        non-homologous surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carboxylic acid residues</ENAMEX> (as
        suggested previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ), or else that a conserved
        non-carboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX>, i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arg82/94</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Asp85/97</NUMEX>, is
        the H +-release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in pR. The higher pH requirement for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> intermediate of pR presumably corresponds with
        adaptation to the more alkaline oceanic environment in
        which the Î³-proteobacteria are found.
        The necessity of reconstituting pR with some lipid
        before it is capable of photocycling shows that the
        presence of lipids facilitates pR in assuming its fully
        active structure. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.-coli</ENAMEX> -expressed pR has
        post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> modifications, including ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> daltons
        of substituents at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cysteines. Such
        post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> modifications might also play a role in
        explaining the different physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bR</ENAMEX>.

          Protein expression and detergent extraction
          Proteorhodopsin was expressed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli strain UT5600</ENAMEX> containing an
          additional plasmid encoding for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-reported pR

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and ampicillin resistance (kindly provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©jÃ </ENAMEX>). Single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were selected and grown overnight
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX>/amp media (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ml, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> rpm). This culture was
          then diluted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10Ã—</NUMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several 500</NUMEX>-ml cultures. After a
          further <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">h incubation</ENAMEX> in the shaker bath, a stock
          solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> L-arabinose was added, to give a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> L-arabinose. This culture was then
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">37Â°C</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> rpm). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~20</NUMEX> ml wet

          collected by centrifugation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6000 rpm Ã— 30 min</ENAMEX>), then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> mL buffer A containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL
          lysozyme, and stirred for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> at room temperature. The
          cells were again collected by centrifugation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> rpm Ã—
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>), then lysed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholate</ENAMEX>, pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 min.</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>). The cells were centrifuged again
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6000 rpm Ã— 30 min</ENAMEX>), and the supernatants collected.
          After extracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> more with the same cholate solution,
          the pooled supernatants were diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10Ã—</NUMEX> with buffer A
          and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180,000</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min</TIMEX> to collect the
          membrane pellet. This cholate-washed membrane pellet was
          then further extracted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.0%</NUMEX> Î²-octyl-D-glucoside
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OG</ENAMEX>) in buffer A (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, with stirring, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>). The pooled
          supernatants, containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OG-solubilized pR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~15 mg</NUMEX>), were
          then diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Ã—</NUMEX> with buffer A.

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vivascience, Westford, MA</ENAMEX>). A portion of the
          Phenylsepharoseâ„¢-purified pR (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 mg</NUMEX>) was diluted to an
          OG concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM acetate.
          It was then loaded on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cm Ã— 1</NUMEX> cm hydroxylapatite
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioGel HTP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX>) column and eluted under pressure

          Mutagenesis
          Methodology for the site-directed mutagenesis of pR is

          Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
          A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> discontinuous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SDS</ENAMEX>/polyacrylamide gel was used
