        Most animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are constantly rearranging their
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to optimally perform their functions or
        to respond appropriately to the changing environment that
        surrounds them. Using a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> "building block"
        that has the ability to self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> to form massive
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> is a common theme used in creating a
        dynamic cytoskeleton. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temporal</ENAMEX> and spatial regulation of
        this self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and its associated disassembly process
        is critical for correct function. For a model system, we
        have focused on the dynamics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filaments
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum . This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> forms a
        self-assembled, highly regulated bi-directional array of
        molecules that together with actin filaments are capable of
        producing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX>. All evidence
        suggests that unless this molecule is assembled into its
        appropriate thick filament array it cannot function to
        produce force.
        Eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> during cell division construct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractile</ENAMEX> rings that are mainly composed of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">actin</ENAMEX>-based cytoskeleton. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Myosin II</ENAMEX>, a key component of
        this actin-based cytoskeleton, has been shown to be
        essential for cytokinesis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells in suspension as
        well as for efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemotaxis</ENAMEX> and morphogenetic changes
        in shape during development) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . All of these roles
        require <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> to be in the form of thick filaments. The
        question of how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> is
        regulated within living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, however, remains mostly
        unanswered. The amoeba 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum has a number of
        advantages as a model system to study in vivo regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> endogenous
        copy of the myosin II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> gene, and null strains of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> are available) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokinesis</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum is also morphologically
        very similar to that of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> molecules
        are constantly relocating into multiple locations for
        participating in various processes. Dynamic exchange occurs
        between a cytosolic soluble pool and assembled filaments
        that are enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton. The
        half-life of myosin between these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> has been measured
        to be ~ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, indicating the importance of dynamic
        assembly control in the localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . When a cell migrates, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II accumulates</ENAMEX> in the
        posterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. During cell division, myosin II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulates</ENAMEX> in the cleavage furrow in the early stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>. To accomplish its cellular tasks, myosin II
        assembles into bipolar thick filaments and pull together
        oppositely oriented actin filaments to produce contractile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Mutant forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> that do not assemble into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bipolar</ENAMEX> thick filaments in vitro fail to rescue myosin null
        phenotypes, nor do they localize to the furrow during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] ). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> is not essential
        for cell division on a surface, it is critical for normal
        timely cell separation and for symmetric placement of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division furrow</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is transported to the
        furrow of dividing cells growing on surfaces even though it
        is not essential for cytokinesis under these
        conditions.
        The assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> monomers into filaments is
        regulated by phosphorylation of its heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the tail [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Dephosphorylation of these threonines is a prerequisite of
        filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, as confirmed by the phenotypes of a
        3xAsp mutant, in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">threonines</ENAMEX> are replaced by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartate residues</ENAMEX> (mimicking the phosphorylated
        state) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In vitro the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3xAsp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is severely
        impaired for filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, and in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3xAsp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> II
        fails to assemble or localize to the cortical cytoskeleton.
        Cells expressing this myosin thus recapitulate the defects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> null cells, including failure to develop
        normally and failure to divide in suspension. In contrast,
        cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> construct
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3xAla</ENAMEX> myosin cells) display severe myosin overassembly
        into the cytoskeleton [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and excessive myosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> to the cleavage furrow during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3xAla</NUMEX> myosin cells also display severe defects in
        chemotactic cell migration, demonstrating the importance of
        proper <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> assembly dynamics in this process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosin</ENAMEX> II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> kinase (MHCK) activity in this
        system capable of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disassembling myosin II filaments</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> was originally reported with partially enriched
        kinase fractions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The enzyme MHCK-A was
        subsequently purified to homogeneity and shown to be
        capable of driving myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> filament disassembly in vitro
        via myosin II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphorylation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] ). A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A cDNA was cloned via expression cloning and peptide
        sequence derived from the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is now recognized as the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinases unrelated to conventional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum and throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal kingdom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homology</ENAMEX>-based cloning and genomic
        approaches led to the identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> closely related
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum enzymes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank accession AAC31918</ENAMEX>, and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ).
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> present in mammalian systems are now
        recognized as having the same conserved catalytic domain,
        including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eEF-2 kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRP-PLIK</ENAMEX>, a
        bifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with kinase and ion channel activities
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Biochemical analysis with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> has confirmed
        that this enzyme phosphorylates 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] ). Analysis reported here confirms that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C also
        readily phosphorylates 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in vitro,
        supporting a possible direct role for this enzyme in myosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> localization control in vivo.
        Although substantial biochemical analysis has been
        performed with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX>, there is
        relatively little information on the cellular distribution
        of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> in vivo. Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steimle</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] reported that in interphase cells, during
        chemotaxis, random migration, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endocytic</ENAMEX>/phagocytic
        events, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A is recruited preferentially to anterior
        F-actin rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protrusions</ENAMEX>. With the discovery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        additional myosin II heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> kinases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C, we report here in live migrating and cytokinetic
        cells a systematic in vivo examination of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> MHCKs
        labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>.
        This analysis reveals striking differences in
        localization between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymes. During
        cytokinesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A displays weak enrichment at the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">poles</ENAMEX>, while MHCK-B displays a mostly diffuse localization.
        In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C displays strong localization to the
        cleavage furrow only during the late stages of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. These results suggest that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells use a family of
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> to modulate myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, each
        with distinct roles.

          The enzymes MHCK-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> have established roles
          in the control of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum myosin filament
          assembly both in vitro and in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 24</NUMEX> ] , and
          Egelhoff, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. T.</ENAMEX>, (unpublished studies). These enzymes
          have a conserved domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that includes a
          highly novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase catalytic domain unrelated to
          conventional kinases, and a carboxyl-terminal WD repeat
          domain that targets these enzymes to myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> filaments
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Genomic sequence corresponding to the related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme MHCK</ENAMEX>-C was deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loomis</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AAC31918</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-C</ENAMEX> differs
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> in that it lacks any significant
          amino-terminal domain upstream of the catalytic domain;
          conserved catalytic domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are present within
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the methionine start codon
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-C</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Of this set of enzymes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C is
          also unique in that it contains a large central domain of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> kDa that consists of highly repetitive
          stretches rich in serine, asparagine, proline, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutamine</ENAMEX>. However, the strong similarity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> in the conserved catalytic domain and
          the carboxyl-terminal WD repeat domain suggested that it
          might represent a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> kinase in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
          To test this possibility at the biochemical level, we
          engineered and expressed an epitope-tagged construct that
          contains an amino-terminal FLAG epitope fused to codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> was purified using a combination

          affinity chromatography. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Purified FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> was
          subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. Western blot analysis with

          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (not shown), and
          Coomassie staining (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) confirmed the purification
          of the expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, migrating at the correct size

          formed with a size of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~ 35 kDa</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). This species
          reacted with both anti-MHCK-C antisera and with anti-FLAG

          assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>, samples of purified

          incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C in the presence and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>.
          Samples were then subjected to centrifugation to sediment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">filaments</ENAMEX>, and the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in
          the pellet in each sample was quantified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue staining as a measure of filament
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C
          in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> resulted in assembly levels typical

          the myosin sedimenting in the current set of assays
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> resulted in substantial filament
          disassembly, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 32%</NUMEX> of the myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> sedimenting
          following phosphorylation. These results confirm that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C can phosphorylate myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, and that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is capable of driving filament
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembly</ENAMEX> in vitro.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> experiments revealed two
          additional features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C biochemical behavior.
          First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> autophosphorylates during the course
          of in vitro phosphorylation reactions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> appears to be very
          low in the initial stages of in vitro phosphorylation
          reactions, but then rises after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 5 minutes</TIMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). These attributes are reminiscent of the
          behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A, which upon purification exists in an
          unphosphorylated low activity <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In vitro
          autophosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A was found to increase the V
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> of the enzyme <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-fold</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . To
          test for similar autophosphorylation regulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C, we tested the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C with</ENAMEX> and
          without an initial autophosphorylation step, towards the
          peptide substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MH-1</ENAMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-residue peptide
          corresponding to one of the mapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> phosphorylation
          target sites for MHCK A in the myosin tail). If
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> was not subjected to a
          pre-autophosphorylation step, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX> incorporation into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX> displayed a similar lag phase as observed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">myosin II</ENAMEX> phosphorylation (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4B</ENAMEX>, open
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbols</ENAMEX>). If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> was pretreated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg-ATP</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at room temperature, the lag phase for peptide
          phosphorylation was eliminated (figure 4Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, closed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbols</ENAMEX>). These results support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that
          autophosphorylation activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-C.</ENAMEX> Another feature
          reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> for MHCK-A activation is that myosin II
          itself stimulates autophosphorylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . To test
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C autophosphorylation is accelerated in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX>, the stoichiometry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLAG-MHCK</ENAMEX>-C
          autophosphorylation was evaluated in the presence and
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II filaments</ENAMEX>. Under the assay
          conditions here, myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> did not significantly
          stimulate the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> autophosphorylation
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>). This result suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C may be
          regulated in vivo by mechanisms distinct from those that
          regulate the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-A.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> have different subcellular localizations in
          interphase cells
          To gain insights into the relative cellular roles and
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A, MHCK-B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C, we have
          evaluated the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusions corresponding to
          each of these enzymes. Distribution of GFP-labelled MHCKs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-A</ENAMEX>, -B and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-C</NUMEX>) was examined in live AX2 cells
          (containing an endogenous mhcA gene). These GFP-MHCK
          expressing cells were able to sporulate and grow in
          suspension, indicating that at the expression level of
          these clonal cell lines, the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX> in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AX2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> does not detectably change myosin II
          expression or function. The fluorescence distributions of
          these cells were compared with cells expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin II</ENAMEX>, obtained by transforming myosin null cells
          with a plasmid that carries GFP-mhcA-containing plasmid
          p102 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>) designated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II
          cells hereafter.
          The localization pattern of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> was first compared to the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II cells in interphase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of each transformation were examined (n
          > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) and examples of the distribution of GFP-MHCK-A
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-A, top), GFP-MHCK-B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-B, top) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-C, top) are shown. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II
          distributed in the cytoplasm and enriched in a cortical
          layer in interphase as has been described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
          is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-M</NUMEX>(top). GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B
          distributed in the cytoplasm, and appeared to be excluded
          from the area that corresponded to nucleus. In contrast
          to GFP-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myosin II</ENAMEX>, GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B did not
          concentrate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-M, top). Pixel
          intensities on a line drawn through the center of the
          cells allow a more quantitative comparison of the
          enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX>. A cortical distribution shows a
          distinctively increased accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescent
          intensity at the cell edges, displaying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> peaks
          flanking the cell cross-section as seen in the case of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-M, middle). Out of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX>, only GFP-MHCK-C appeared to be concentrated
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-C, top), and had the
          fluorescent profiles containing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two flanking</TIMEX> peaks
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-C, middle). GFP-MHCK-C also appears to be
          excluded from the nucleus, similar to that seen in cells
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II.
          In free-moving cells, GFP-MHCK-A was frequently
          transiently enriched in the protruding edge (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-A,
          bottom), and hence results in rather noticeable
          pseudopods at the anterior region compared with that in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin II</ENAMEX> cells. A time-lapse movie in Quicktime
          format illustrating this behavior is available as an
          additional file (see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-B</ENAMEX>,
          however, displayed no indication of transient enrichment
          in any part of the cells while moving; instead it
          distributes homogeneously within cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-B,
          bottom). The cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-B</ENAMEX> appeared to have
          smooth cell edges because the fluorescence did not label
          the dynamic pseudopods at the leading edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
          compared with that in GFP-MHCK-A cells. In contrast to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A and MHCK-B distribution, GFP-MHCK-C was frequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the posterior cortex of the moving cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-C, bottom), as seen also for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-D, bottom). GFP-MHCK-C occasionally displayed transient
          enrichment in pseudopodial extensions as well (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Dynamic localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and
          GFP-MHCK-C in the cortex of living D.
          discoideumcells
          As shown above, in interphase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and
          GFP-MHCK-C expressed in the presence of myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> both
          concentrate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX>. The actin-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cortex</ENAMEX> is
          estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.1-0.2 Î¼m</NUMEX> thick in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ,
          similar to the thickness in other eukaryotic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          . This dimension makes total internal reflection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> (TIRF) microscopy an attractive tool to
          examine cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-labelled proteins</ENAMEX> at the
          cell-surface contacts. Total internal reflection occurs
          when light travelling in a medium with high refractive
          index encounters a medium with low refractive index
          beyond the critical angle, determined by the ratio of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> refractive indices according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Snell's law</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          ] . In our experiments, the coverslip and the cells
          represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with high and low refractive indices,
          respectively. Under this condition, there is still an
          exponentially-decayed, evanescent wave penetrating into
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells. The typical
          depth of the evanescent wave is in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-200</ENAMEX>
          nm away from the coverslip, which is suitable for
          exciting cortical GFP-proteins in living 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells.
          As examined by in vitro electron microscopy,
          negatively stained purified wild-type myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> molecules
          formed bipolar thick filaments <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> Î¼m in length [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          ] . Filament <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of similar size have also been
          observed via immunofluorescent microscopic observation of
          fixed cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Examination of live, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II
          expressing cells with a TIRF microscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A) shows
          an accumulation of fluorescent rod-like shapes with an
          estimated length to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.64 Î¼m</NUMEX> (standard
          deviation = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX>). This dimension is consistent
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filaments measured from the in vitro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopy photographs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Using TIRF
          microscopy, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, putative filaments, are not
          apparent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-3xAsp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in which the three
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thr</ENAMEX> phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> have been replaced
          with Asp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (data not shown). As this MHC mutation
          inhibits filament assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , the inability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-3xASP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> to form such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> suggests that
          these TIRF-resolved structures are discrete myosin II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX>. Our TIRF analysis furthermore indicated that a
          few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filaments move
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamically</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filaments</ENAMEX> moved a long distance across
          the field with a velocity up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.4</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼m/sec</ENAMEX>
          before stopping. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filaments</ENAMEX> seemed to be confined to
          a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> and eventually disappeared.
          GFP-MHCK-C expressing cells (in the presence of myosin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>), display punctate aggregates of fluorescence, with
          the longer dimension <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.30 Î¼m</NUMEX> (standard
          deviation = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). The shorter
          dimension is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> Î¼m, similar to what was
          observed in myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> thick filaments. The GFP-MHCK-C
          fluorescent aggregates showed dynamic motility similar to
          that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II aggregates. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> could
          not be detected when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> was expressed in myosin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> null cells (data not shown), suggesting that the
          formation of the GFP-MHCK-C punctate aggregates is myosin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II-dependent</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Differential localization of GFP-MHCKs during
          cytokinesis
          At the early stage of cytokinesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reorganizes</ENAMEX> and is concentrated into the region that
          flanks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">furrow</ENAMEX> located at the equatorial region of the
          dividing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-M, top). As the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells
          continue to separate (denoted the late stage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> II persists in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>, which
          becomes the posterior region of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forming
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">daughter cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-M, bottom). <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin II</ENAMEX>, on the
          other hand, was not enriched in the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and
          therefore the polar regions displayed a smooth contour in
          fluorescent images, as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCK-A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-A</NUMEX>) or -B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-B</ENAMEX>) was
          observed to be concentrated in the furrow region during
          any stage of cytokinesis; nor did they localize to the
          posterior region of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells at the late
          stage of cytokinesis. Instead, GFP-MHCK-A was enriched in
          the protrusions extending from the poles of the dividing
          cells, which resulted in a more prominent appearance of
          the ruffling polar pseudopods throughout the cytokinesis
          process. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-B</ENAMEX>, however, stayed homogeneously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> during cytokinesis without any sign of
          enrichment in any region. It was excluded from the polar
          protrusions, as seen by the smooth contour of the poles
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-B</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, as the cells progressed from
          the early to late stages of cytokinesis, GFP-MHCK-B
          appeared to be excluded from the furrow (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7-B</ENAMEX>), as
          compared to the appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-A</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCK-C.</ENAMEX>
          The localization pattern of GFP-MHCK-C was different
          from the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-C</NUMEX>). At the early stage
          of cytokinesis, GFP-MHCK-C generally displayed a
          cytosolic distribution with some uniform cortical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrichment</ENAMEX>, but showed no sign of furrow concentration.
          However, at the late stage of cytokinesis, as soon as the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells begin to separate from each other,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> became detectable at the newly formed
          posterior regions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells. The spatial
          localization of GFP-MHCK-C is similar to that observed
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> at the late stage of cytokinesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-Band 7-M</ENAMEX>). In summary, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX> have
          distributions that are temporally and spatially
          different, as summarized in the sketches shown in Figure
          7bottom.
          To further illustrate the differential temporal
          localization, images of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells expressing GFP-MHCK-C
          are compared to a cell expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interphase</ENAMEX> (I, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) to the fully divided daughter
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interphase</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cells
          display cortical distribution of the GFP-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. When the cells progress into the quiescence
          stage (Q; equivalent to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-mitosis</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> loses
          its cortical enrichment while <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-myosin II</ENAMEX> typically
          remains cortical. When the cells begin to elongate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> already concentrates at the
          equatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and remains there through the early
          stage (C 
          e , Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>stage (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> , Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), and the late stage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>. GFP-MHCK-C, however, displays no sign of
          furrow localization until the late stage of cytokinesis,
          when it suddenly appears at the posterior region of the
          daughter cells and stays for the duration of cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). Time lapse movies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quicktime</ENAMEX> format

          Localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX> in the absence of myosin
          II
          To understand whether the differential distribution
          observed on GFP-MHCK-A, -B and -C cells depended on the
          existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX>, we expressed these kinases in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">myosin II</ENAMEX> null cells and compared the localization
          patterns. GFP-MHCK-A and -B showed identical localization
          in both interphase and cytokinesis cells regardless of
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in the cells (data not shown).
          GFP-MHCK-C, however, failed to localize to the cortex in
          interphase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> null, top), and the two
          characteristic peaks were missing in the linescan. During
          free movement in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX>, GFP-MHCK-C was
          not enriched in the posterior region of the cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> null, bottom). At the early stage of cytokinesis
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">myosin</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> null cells, GFP-MHCK-C was not enriched the
          furrow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, top), similar to what was
          observed in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> as shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-C, top. However, when myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> null cells progressed
          to the late stage of cell separation, GFP-MHCK-C was
          never localized to the constricting furrow or to the
          forming posterior region of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> null, bottom).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results reported here provide biochemical and
        cellular evidence indicating that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum contains a related
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> kinase isoforms that display distinct modes
        of regulation in vitro and distinct localization dynamics
        in vivo during contractile events, particularly during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokinesis</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-A</ENAMEX> has been extensively
        characterized at the biochemical level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 22 25 31</NUMEX> ] ,
        only limited biochemical analysis has been performed with
        bacterially-expressed subdomains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B and MHCK-C</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 22</NUMEX> ] . The current biochemical results provide strong
        support for the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-C</ENAMEX> acts as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> kinase
        in vivo. Further studies with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> compounds
        may help to identify upstream physiological mechanisms that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">regulate MHCK-C autophosphorylation/activation.</ENAMEX>
        Using epi-fluorescence microscopy, we observe strikingly
        different patterns of dynamic localization for MHCK-A, -B,
        and -C during polarized migration and cytokinesis. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C localization are particularly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intriguing</ENAMEX>, with global or posterior cortical enrichment
        observed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interphase</TIMEX>, with a dramatic accumulation in
        the furrow during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late cytokinesis.</TIMEX> The apparent absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C from the furrow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early/mid cytokinesis</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is clearly accumulating, suggests that specific
        regulatory mechanisms may exist to recruit this enzyme to
        the furrow during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late cytokinesis.</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-localization of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> with its apparent substrate
        does not imply that the kinase, in vivo, is actively
        phosphorylating its substrate. The dynamic localization of
        a kinase is only one way to regulate its activity. In fact,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> are very likely to be highly regulated enzymes;
        previous studies have documented the in vitro regulation of
        MHCK A by autophosphorylation, myosin filaments, and acidic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , and data presented here documents
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> can also be regulated via autophosphorylation.
        Further studies are needed to confirm similar regulation in
        vivo, and to better define the upstream regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. With these caveats, the distinct localization
        patterns for MHCK-A, -B, and -C reported here provide
        valuable clues as to which spatial and temporal myosin II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> may be acted upon by each enzyme.
        The dynamics of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> also display striking
        differences in their dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">myosin</ENAMEX> II. When the GFP
        fusions are imaged in myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> null cells, both MHCK-A and
        MHCK-B display dynamics indistinguishable from their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviour</ENAMEX> in cells wild type for myosin II. In contrast,
        loss of cortical and furrow localization is seen for
        GFP-MHCK-C in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">myosin</ENAMEX> II. This result
        suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C localization in these settings may be
        achieved via direct association with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II filaments</ENAMEX>.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIRF</ENAMEX> studies further support this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, suggesting
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C may physically associate with myosin II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX>. GFP-MHCK-C under the TIRF microscope displayed
        short particles with a longer dimension <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately half</TIMEX>
        of the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II thick filaments</ENAMEX>. The bare zone
        of purified wild-type myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> thick filaments was
        estimated previously to be in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX> Î¼m [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . Based upon these results, we suggest that GFP-MHCK-C
        may colocalize with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> thick filaments by binding at
        the bare zone.
        Comparison of the localization pattern between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-MHCKs</ENAMEX> provides us a map of where
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> localize at different stages in the
        vegetative cells, as well as how these MHCKs coordinated to
        ensure proper regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II thick filament</ENAMEX>.
        Figure 11depicts our current working model for the dynamics
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCKs</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interphase</TIMEX> (A), early cytokinesis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) and late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX> (C). Localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> does not require myosin II. With or without myosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, both MHCK-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> are excluded from the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interphase</TIMEX>; and neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-A</ENAMEX> nor MHCK-B
        colocalize with regions of highest myosin II concentration
        in moving cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11-A</TIMEX>). We suggest that the enrichment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A to polar ruffles of dividing cells may represent
        a mechanism by which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells locally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disassemble myosin II filaments</ENAMEX> to facilitate the polarized
        recruitment of filaments to the forming contractile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ring/furrow</ENAMEX> zone. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is consistent with the recent
        report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A displays enrichment into anterior
        F-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">actin</NUMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protrusions</ENAMEX> of polarized cells during
        chemotaxis, and into phagocytic and macropinocytotic
        extensions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The polar localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A would
        be consistent with the long-standing "polar relaxation"
        model for cytoskeletal reorganization during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokinesis</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A may represent a factor that contributes to
        polar relaxation in this system via polar disassembly of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">filaments</ENAMEX>. The cytosolic localization of MHCK-B
        suggests that this enzyme may contribute to a continuous
        and uniform turnover of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> filaments throughout the
        cell, although it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK-B</ENAMEX> plays more
        specific roles in functions yet to be identified.
        We suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C is recruited to the contractile
        ring during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late cytokinesis</TIMEX> to facilitate the orderly
        removal of excess myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> from the ring as the furrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ingresses</ENAMEX>. It is particularly intriguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C
        colocalizes with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in the furrow only at the
        culmination of cytokinesis where turnover and mobilization
        of thick filaments might be most appropriate. At this time
        the cell cycle contraction force requirements are predicted
        to fall [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and the cell's geometrical changes would
        require <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> thick filaments to disassemble. Although
        it is clear throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal kingdom</ENAMEX> and in protozoa
        that the mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> furrow decreases
        steadily with furrow ingression, no mechanism has been
        identified in any other system that can explain this
        regulated disassembly. Dynamic changes in MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> levels within the contractile ring have
        been reported in dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urchin embryos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> phosphorylation as a mechanism
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">regulating furrow myosin II</ENAMEX> disassembly may occur in other
        systems besides 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum . We suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C participates in this regulated myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembly</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum , and that this
        function may be regulated at both the cellular and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> level.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We suggest that differential localization of MHCKs
        occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> discoideum cells for the purpose of regulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">myosin II</ENAMEX> filament assembly levels in the context of
        specific cellular contractile events such as lamellipodium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> and cytokinetic furrowing. The late appearance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C during furrowing suggests a cellular mechanism
        regulating its localization, and our biochemical data
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C phosphorylation levels may represent a
        mechanism for the fine-tuning of the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C in
        the cleavage furrow during cell division. This level of
        regulation could be mediated via <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> control
        of autophosphorylation, or via direct MHCK-C
        phosphorylation by other kinases. Further studies are in
        progress to test these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmid construction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusions to MHCK A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> were
          constructed by placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">GFP</ENAMEX> at the amino-terminus of each
          kinase coding region, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fused to codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of each
          kinase open reading frame. All fusions were made in the
          GFP expression vector pTX-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The construct for
          MHCK A has been described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
          sequences for MHCK A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX> C correspond to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A55532</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAB50136</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAC31918</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. Cloning of the cDNA encoding MHCK-C has
          been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> purification and phosphorylation
          assays
          A FLAG epitope was fused to the amino-terminus of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-C at codon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> using the vector pTX-FLAG [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The
          resulting plasmid, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pTX-MKC2</TIMEX>, was transformed into the
          cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ax2</NUMEX> and clonal cell lines were selected with
          G418 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> medium. To facilitate FLAG-MHCK-C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein purification</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ax2/pTX-MKC2</ENAMEX> cell lines were then
          subjected to incremental increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">G418</ENAMEX> selection
          level over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 3 weeks</TIMEX>, to a final selection
          level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml.</ENAMEX> As reported previously for expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , this selection process resulted in
          cell lines with increased expression level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX>, several-fold higher than the initial
          expression level. In previous work, when this method was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MHCK-A-</ENAMEX>expressing cell lines the elevated
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCK</ENAMEX>-A resulted in myosin II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperphosphorylation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myosin II filament disassembly</ENAMEX>,
          and corresponding loss of ability of cells to grow in
          suspension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . We observed the same effect in the
          current studies in attempting to force high expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pTX-MKC2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> was therefore
          transfected into 3xALA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> II cells, which are
          resistant to myosin filament hyperphosphorylation and
          disassembly due to elimination of phosphorylation target
          sites in the myosin tail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The resultant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3xALA/pTX-MKC2</ENAMEX> cells could be propagated in suspension
          culture even after selection for elevated expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">40 Î¼g/ml G418.</ENAMEX>
          For purification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-10 liters of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3xALA/pTX-MKC2</ENAMEX> cells were propagated in suspension
          culture in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> medium to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5</NUMEX> Ã <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 6cells/ml.</ENAMEX>
          All subsequent steps were performed at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4Â°</ENAMEX>. Cells were
          harvested by centrifugation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-50</NUMEX> g typical yield), then
          washed once in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5</NUMEX> (TBS).
          Cells were resuspended with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/g cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 mM EDTA</TIMEX>. Protease <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor cocktails</ENAMEX> PIC1
          and PIC2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000X</TIMEX> stock were then added to 5X
          final concentration, and cells lysed either by sonication
          or by repeated douncing. Lysate was adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> (to dissociate MHCK-C from binding to particulate
          material), then subjected to centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125,000</NUMEX> Ã
          g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> min. The resulting cleared supernatant was
          brought to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> saturation with powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium</ENAMEX> sulfate
          and incubated with stirring for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The ammonium
          sulfate precipitate, containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-MHCK-C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          was collected by centrifugation and resuspended with
          gentle douncing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TBS</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> (TBSE),

          Fluorescence microscopy
          Cells were imaged in a chambered coverslip (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nunc</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naperville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MES</ENAMEX> buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM

          previously described (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabry et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) with the
          following modifications. The light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was replaced to
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Xe arc lamp</ENAMEX> that has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> increase over the typical
          input power of an epi-fluorescent lamp and therefore
          delivers higher output. This is beneficial when viewing
          low GFP-expressing cells. For imaging cells reported
          here, the light was typically attenuated to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 3%</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> output. The output of the lamp is directed to the
          microscope by a liquid light-guide. This set up greatly
          reduces the effect of vibration and heat on the samples
          and the microscope. Images were collected and analyzed
