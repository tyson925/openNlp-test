        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> survival rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with lung cancer
        is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15%</NUMEX>, and it has changed only marginally in
        the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Tumor stage is the most significant
        prognostic parameter for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> survival, but even patients
        with non-small cell lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (non-SCLC) in pathologic
        stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IA disease</ENAMEX> (a tumor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 3</NUMEX> cm diameter
        located in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lobe of the lung and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> cm from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carina</ENAMEX> without visceral pleural involvement, atelectasis,
        or pneumonitis, and absence of metastatic spread to
        regional lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>) have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> chance of recurrence
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> after complete surgical resection (lobectomy
        with mediastinal lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node dissection</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. In this group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the tumor most frequently recurs at distant
        sites, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, liver, adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">glands</ENAMEX>, and brain
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], and the size of the primary tumor does not appear to
        impact on survival [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. This suggests that even small and
        seemingly resectable lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> metastasize early. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
        from randomized screening trials for lung cancer
        corroborate this observation. In these studies, more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> were detected in resectable stages, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-year
        survival rates were higher in the screened population
        compared to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but mortality rates
        (total death rate independent of time) from lung cancer
        were equal in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        For this reason, it is important to develop methods that
        will permit facile detection of bronchial mucosal
        abnormalities that are precursors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> before
        systemic shedding of tumor cells occurs. Such precursor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> can be detected by sputum cytology and by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchoscopy</ENAMEX> in large airways accessible by endoscopy. They
        include metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (CIS), which are thought to
        represent progressive histologic correlates of
        carcinogenesis for squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Current data suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> of current and former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> have metaplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> have dysplastic
        lesions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. However, not all such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> progress to
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. For instance, smoking cessation, which can be
        viewed as a form of active intervention, appears to result
        in a decrease of metaplasia rates from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> in active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> in former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. It is estimated that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX> will progress to invasive cancer
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-month</TIMEX> time period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        followed by regular bronchoscopy at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-month time</TIMEX> intervals,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> developed lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> that had previously been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsied</ENAMEX> and interpreted as normal bronchial epithelium [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. These results raise several important questions: A) Are
        there determinants in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> that predict
        outcome, i.e., progression versus regression? B) Are there
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX> in morphologically normal bronchial mucosa
        that predict outcome? C) Can lung cancer arise directly
        from normal bronchial mucosa or are histopathologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX> required?
        To address these questions, one promising approach would
        be the development of specific immunohistochemical markers
        capable of improving the sensitivity and reliability of
        methods currently employed to detect precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologic</ENAMEX> and cytologic specimens [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Because
        proliferation is a requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> development,
        markers specific for cell proliferation are expected to
        prove useful.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> proliferation markers, proliferating cell nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> (PCNA) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>, have been extensively studied in
        this context. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> is a homotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that binds
        tightly to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> replication
        and repair. It is essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and is
        found in all proliferating cells. However, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> is
        also essential for several types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair, it may be
        present in non-proliferating cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> is an
        epitope of a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> recognized by the MIB-1
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is frequently expressed
        throughout the cell cycle of proliferating cells, and it
        has not been detected in non-proliferating cells. During
        interphase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> is located primarily in nucleolar and
        peri-nucleolar regions, and it appears to be associated
        with condensed chromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is still unknown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], however, it appears to be
        required for cells to progress through the cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistochemical</ENAMEX> studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        indicate that, in at least some cases, increased lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>
        staining for these markers correlates with decreased
        survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. These proliferation markers can
        also be detected in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of the lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>].
        In this report, we describe the results of our
        comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these classic proliferation markers,
        Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>, with a new proliferation marker, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. MCM2 is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. These serve as components of "licensing
        factor," which is essential for initiation of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX> and for limiting replication to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> round per
        cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. The MCM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are also associated
        with replication forks and are likely to stimulate the
        unwinding of the parental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> strands at these forks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        We previously demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] that, in normal tissues,
        MCM2 is detectable only in proliferating cells. Not
        surprisingly, it is also present in a high proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells. Our results showed a higher proportion of
        positively stained cells in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast lesions</ENAMEX>
        than with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Others have reported
        similar results for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCM</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> compared with Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> for detection of a variety of premalignant cell
        types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>], but a comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCM proteins</ENAMEX> with
        Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> or PCNA as markers for premalignant lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> has
        not previously been reported.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          MCM2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> expression in bronchial biopsy
          specimens from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> or with
          suspected lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were studied by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> (IHC). We reviewed all pathology
          specimens from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that had undergone
          bronchoscopy with standard white light and laser-induced
          fluorescence at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 to March 2000</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          selected for further analysis based on the presence of
          abnormal morphology and the availability of multiple
          specimen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4-17</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>) for investigations. Of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the highest degree of abnormality in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          was metaplasia, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> dysplasia, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> invasive
          squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were Caucasian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. All were active or former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Sample preparation and selection
          From each specimen block, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 serial 4-Î</NUMEX>¼m <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          cut and placed on charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sections 1-4</ENAMEX> were
          used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 5</ENAMEX> was stained with hematoxylin
          and eosin. This latter section was reviewed and compared
          with the original slide used for diagnostic purposes. In
          41 specimens, the morphology was comparable between the
          original slide and slide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> specimens were used
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> analysis and included morphologically normal
          bronchial mucosa, metaplasia, dysplasia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX> (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1for</ENAMEX> the numbers of specimens with normal and
          abnormal morphology).
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          Sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit
          antibodies raised and affinity-purified against the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Parallel sections were
          stained with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIB-1</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX> against
          Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carpinteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> was performed
          as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          deparaffinized, and those to be stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> were
          subjected to microwave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX> in citrate
          buffer for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>, twice. Antigen retrieval was not
          required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIB-1</ENAMEX> was used at a dilution of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCM2 antibody</ENAMEX> was used at a dilution of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:500.</TIMEX> The
          avidin-biotin detection method was employed on a Ventana
          Automated System (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>). An irrelevant rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antiserum</ENAMEX> served as a negative control. Percentage,
          intensity, and distribution of stained cells were
          analyzed and scored for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> independently by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAH</ENAMEX>) with similar results.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The percent of cells stained for each sample was
          estimated as a continuous number ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 100</NUMEX>.
          The staining intensity was categorically coded as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          (absent), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (weak), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (moderate), or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> (strong). The
          average of both the percent of cells stained and staining
          intensity was calculated for each type of specimen
          (normal mucosa, metaplasia, dysplasia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX>). To test for
          differences between the staining characteristics of MCM2
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> both the parametric paired samples t-test and
          the non-parametric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank-sum test were performed.
          To test for differences across specimen classes (normal
          mucosa, metaplasia, dysplasia and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX>) for each stain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MCM2</NUMEX>), the analysis of variance method as well
          as the non-parametric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> tests were used. To
          test specifically for differences between dysplasia and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX> for each stain, the independent samples t-test and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> tests were performed. Both parametric
          and non-parametric tests were used because the
          distributional assumptions required for parametric
          testing may not be satisfied in all cases. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests assumed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided alternative with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> level of significance.
        
      
      
        Results
        In normal bronchial mucosa, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>, generated similar patterns: some
        cells in the basal and parabasal layer of the bronchial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epithelium</ENAMEX> displayed immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        proportion of cells staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> was significantly ( 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>) greater than for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In both cases, the intensity of nuclear staining
        was variable.
        In premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, evaluation of the staining by
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) revealed significantly ( 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) more frequent staining
        of nuclei within metaplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against
        MCM2 than by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>. We also noticed
        that, in metaplasia, anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> frequently stained both
        basal cells and cells throughout the entire thickness of
        the epithelium, while anti-Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> primarily stained basal
        cells and cells in the lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half of the epithelium</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, lower of the two "metaplasia" panels). Although the
        number of samples of dysplasia and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX> was too low to
        permit statistical evaluation of the differences between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, we noticed that in every case of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX> or CIS, the frequency of cells stained by
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> was as high or higher than the frequency of
        staining by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>. In fact, the same relationship was
        evident in the normal mucosa and metaplasia samples.
        Consequently, when the data for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
        combined, the difference in staining frequency between
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> and anti-Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> was highly significant ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.001; Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        We observed variable staining in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
        In many cases, within single lesions some regions stained
        while others did not, and the intensity of staining was
        variable from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and from cell to cell within
        regions. The level of variability was similar for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        In the progression from normal mucosa to metaplasia to
        dysplasia, the results obtained with both antibodies
        suggested differences in staining frequency and intensity.
        For both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, the mean percentages of cells stained
        and staining intensity were different across specimen
        categories (all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.010</NUMEX>) and increased
        from normal mucosa to metaplasia and from metaplasia to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX>. Although the sample numbers are too low to draw
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> conclusion, the data suggest a possible decrease in
        staining frequency by both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> in the transition
        from dysplasia to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.117</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.080</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        No significant differences were detected between the
        average stain intensities produced by the two antibodies
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        This is the first comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCM2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        expression in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of the human lung, and
        it showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> was expressed in a greater percentage
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in normal mucosa and in premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> than
        Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>. The proportion of cells stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCM2</ENAMEX> ranged from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% to 100%</NUMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1% to 60%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
        average percentage of cells stained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11-64%</NUMEX>) was
        higher than that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX>). Statistical analyses of
        the frequencies of positively stained cells were done with
        the paired samples t-test and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> sign rank test.
        Both tests showed a striking difference ( 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) in immunoreactivity
        between these markers across all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> samples. This finding
        suggests that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> may prove to be a more sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate marker</ENAMEX> for lung cancer risk than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>.
        However, there are several caveats to the use of MCM2
        for assessing lung cancer risk. Most importantly, the
        ability of cells to proliferate, even though a hallmark of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malignancy</ENAMEX>, is also a component of inflammation and
        healing. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metaplastic lesions</ENAMEX> are frequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with chronic inflammation as exemplified by the
        presence of such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> but only
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, even high-grade
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX> does not necessarily lead to invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. The fact that anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> more frequently stains
        metaplastic cells at the epithelial surface suggests that
        it is more likely than anti-Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> to detect exfoliated
        proliferating epithelial cells in cytological specimens
        such as sputum. However, this presumably higher sensitivity
        for premalignant cells could be accompanied by an
        unacceptably low specificity. Therefore, it is important to
        assess the positive predictive value of both markers, MCM2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>, for lung cancer risk in cytologic and histologic
        specimens from a defined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at risk for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in a prospective study.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, there has been a shift in the predominant type
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> from squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> over the past <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 31</ENAMEX>]. Since adenocarcinomas predominantly arise
        in the periphery of the lung and less frequently in the
        larger and more easily accessible airways, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of
        assessing morphological, molecular, and proliferative
        changes in these larger airways may be called into
        question. During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1970s</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> randomized lung cancer
        screening trials were conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, and each of
        these trials used sputum cytology as one of the means to
        detect lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at an early stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 34</TIMEX>]. Aside
        from the major finding that screening did not reduce lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality, several other important facts were
        uncovered. These included the findings that lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
        detected by sputum cytology only, compared to chest X-ray
        only, had a higher rate of complete resectability (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> vs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>) and a higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> survival rate (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>];
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> detected by
        sputum cytology were adenocarcinomas and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> were
        squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]; that sputum cytology
        detected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> of all incident cases of lung cancer
        (excluding interval cases) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]; and that sputum cytology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">detected 6/40</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. It can thus be
        concluded that cytological examination of sputum specimens
        is able to detect adenocarcinomas at an early stage albeit
        with low sensitivity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>). Staining of sputum specimens
        for proliferation markers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>, may
        increase that sensitivity by focusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist</ENAMEX>'s
        attention on proliferating cells. In addition to its
        potential for detecting frank malignancy, staining for
        proliferation markers may also provide an estimate of the
        frequency of potentially precancerous conditions
        (metaplasia and dysplasia) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX>. This
        estimate may be helpful for determining whether to initiate
        other more costly evaluations for lung cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> are both markers of cellular
        proliferation and required for cell cycle progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>], the fact that anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> stained a larger
        number of cells than anti-Ki-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every specimen</TIMEX> examined
        suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> may be expressed during a shorter
        interval of the cell cycle than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX>. MCM2 is present
        throughout the cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> expressed during S, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase.
        Variability of cell cycle time in mammalian cells is
        largely a result of differences in the duration of G1
        phase. Thus, specimens that consist of a relatively slow
        growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells and consequently a higher
        proportion of cells in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase would show staining of more
        cells with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>. Conversely, specimens with
        cells dividing at a high rate would show staining of near
        equal numbers of cells for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>. Thus it is
        likely that staining for both, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCM2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX>, will provide
        information about cell cycle distribution and possibly
        growth dynamics not obtainable by staining for either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> alone.
        Finally, the data presented on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> expression by IHC
        were obtained with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. The supply of these purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, and their use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCM2</TIMEX> immunostaining is therefore
        not uniformly available. Although additional polyclonal
        antibody preparations can be generated by immunizing more
        rabbits, the best solution would be the commercial
        availability of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCM2 monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX>.
        Fortunately, several of these are now available and useful
        for Western blotting and staining of frozen sections. The
        utility of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> in paraffin-embedded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> is being investigated.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have confirmed that polyclonal anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCM2</NUMEX> antibodies
        provide consistent, reliable staining in routinely fixed
        tissues without a requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX>.
        Results obtained are easy to interpret, since there is a
        striking difference between normal bronchoepithelium and
        premalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. Thus MCM2 is an easy-to-use marker,
        which has great potential for assessment of progression and
        regression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morphologically abnormal lesions</ENAMEX> in future
        primary lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> prevention studies and for the early
        detection of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in screening studies.
