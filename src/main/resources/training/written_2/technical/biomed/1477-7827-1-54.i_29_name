        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> or PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) is a
        glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> found on
        all mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spermatozoa</ENAMEX> that have been examined, and has
        been reported to play multiple roles in fertilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . Although a recent gene targeting study indicates that in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, which have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> active non-somatic hyaluronidases,
        Spam1 is not essential for fertilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ; this is
        unlikely to be the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is the only
        such hyaluronidase present. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">primates SPAM1</TIMEX> has been
        shown to play a role in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> functions during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) hyaluronidase enzyme activity necessary
        for penetrating the cumulus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and for which it is best
        known [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) zona pellucida binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+signaling-associated acrosomal exocytosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Unlike somatic ubiquitous hyaluronidases that are active
        only at acidic pH [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> has hyaluronidase activity
        at both neutral and acidic pHs, which arise from two
        different regions within the hyaluronidase domain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The neutral enzyme activity, which is predominant in
        insoluble membrane-bound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX>, is necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> to
        penetrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>)-rich extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> of the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. The
        acidic enzyme activity is present in soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> that is
        generated during the acrosome reaction (AR), after cleavage
        at its carboxy terminus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primate sperm</ENAMEX> where
        SPAM1 is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the proteolytically cleaved
        secretory form that is released after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> reported a significant increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spam1</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caudal</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> compared to caput ones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This
        finding led to the discovery that 
        Spam1 is also expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        regions of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymis</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymal Spam1</ENAMEX> and its
        transcript were found in both wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>-free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> (germ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-deficient) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as well as in cultured
        epididymal epithelial cells, completely eliminating the
        possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is merely being transported
        into the epididymis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Expression was shown to be
        in the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the epididymal epithelium and to
        occur preferentially in the distal regions of the tract.
        Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin-DeLeon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) found evidence
        that mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymal Spam1</ENAMEX> is secreted 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro and that the gene is
        differentially regulated in testis and epididymis.
        Consistent with epididymal expression, putative androgen
        responsive elements (AREs) were discovered in the murine 
        Spam1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5</ENAMEX>'-flanking region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Since 
        SPAM1 is widely conserved among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] it is likely that its pattern of expression
        may also be conserved. Therefore, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> might also be
        expressed in the epididymis, where it could play an
        important role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm maturation</ENAMEX>. For this reason, it was
        thought worthwhile to investigate the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymis</ENAMEX> and vas deferens for which a possible
        role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm maturation</ENAMEX> has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Because
        of the difficulty in obtaining fresh human tissue we
        included in our study tissues of 
        cynomolgus macaque which is a primate
        model for studying human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm maturation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Procurement of human and macaque tissues
          Human specimens were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of various ages. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was a surgical
          specimen from the human proximal corpus epididymis. It
          was obtained from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45-year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>) of known
          fertility who underwent surgical excision of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX> because of a large spermatocele (a cystic
          swelling) at the level of the corpus epididymis. After
          surgical removal, a portion (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> cm in length) of the
          intact, non-dilated corpus epididymis was placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          for the experiment. It was then washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, embedded
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OCT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-Î¼m</NUMEX> thick
          sections were made from the frozen specimen using a Leica
          Cryostat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3050</TIMEX> S.
          Post-mortem reproductive tissues were obtained from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. One was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42-year-old</TIMEX> who had died from a
          myocardial infarction and was not known to have any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> problems (Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>). The tissues (testis,
          epididymis, and vas deferens) were obtained through the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Disease Research Interchange</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NDRI</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) and were either snap frozen in liquid
          nitrogen or embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OCT</ENAMEX> or paraffin for sectioning.
          Tissues from Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3 and 4</NUMEX>, who were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 and 68 years</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>, were obtained in the form of slides made from
          paraffin-embedded sections of testis, epididymis, vas
          deferens, and seminal vesicles through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). The tissues were analyzed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist</ENAMEX> and found
          to be morphologically normal and there were no known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> problems or medical pathologies that could
          affect reproductive function. Similarly morphologically
          normal tissues were used for epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56 year-old</TIMEX> male (Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>), and the slides were
          obtained from the histology core at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Carolina Medical School</ENAMEX>. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          known not to be on hormone therapy prior to death.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macaque</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cynomolgus</ENAMEX> ) reproductive issues
          were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 2 males
          who were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years old</TIMEX> and of known fertility. Testis,
          epididymis, and vas deferens from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> were snap
          frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OCT</ENAMEX> or paraffin
          after standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde fixation</ENAMEX> for sectioning.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laser Microdissection</ENAMEX> (LM)/RT-PCR
          To analyze the mRNA expression of 
          SPAM1 in the epididymal epithelium,
          frozen sections from Subjects <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1 and #2</NUMEX> and
          paraffin-embedded sections from Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX> were used. For
          macaques, frozen sections of the corpus were obtained
          from Animal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> and paraffin-embedded sections of the
          cauda were from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animal</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>. All paraffin-embedded
          sections were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALM</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbeam</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALM Microlaser Technologies AG</ENAMEX>,
          Bernreid, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) was used for laser cutting and
          separation of selected tissue regions. Immediately prior
          to microdissection, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was removed from frozen
          sections by soaking the slides in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>
          followed by air-drying for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. Paraffin-embedded
          sections were treated to remove the paraffin with xylene,
          prior to the ethanol treatment. Once the tissues were
          air-dried, the target cells, (epididymal epithelial
          cells) were carefully laser-microdissected according to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions with the cells being
          collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral oil</ENAMEX>. The microdissection was
          performed with care to exclude sperm present in the lumen
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In addition to microdissection of the
          epithelial cells, stromal cells were also microdissected
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> to be used as a negative control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). LM conditions were as follows: laser focus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67-69</NUMEX>,
          laser energy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72-76</NUMEX> cut speed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. These values varied
          slightly depending on the thickness (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-12 Î¼m</ENAMEX>) of the
          sections. The total areas of epididymal cells that were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microdissected</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 350,000</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450,000</NUMEX> Î<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¼m 2</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral oil</ENAMEX> were kept at
          -80Â°C until <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction was performed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA Extraction</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Reverse Transcription-Polymerase</ENAMEX>
          Chain reaction (RT-PCR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM</ENAMEX> samples using the Ambion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cells-to-DNA II Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>)
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. Briefly, cells
          were lysed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cell Lysis II Buffer</ENAMEX> after incubation at
          75Â°C for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min. DNase I was added and the lysate
          incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min. After inactivation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min 5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the lysate was used for
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand synthesis under the conditions recommended
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments were performed
          simultaneously without the addition of reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (RT). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> microliters of each reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> product was subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification
          using a pair of primers (forward: nt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1524-1543</TIMEX>; reverse
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1827-1843</TIMEX>) designed from the last exon and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of
          the human 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> sequence (GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accession No. 003117</ENAMEX>), to yield a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">320 bp.</ENAMEX> The
          identical primer set was used for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaques</ENAMEX>. As an added negative control, primers (forward:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nt 268-285</ENAMEX>; reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">360-377</ENAMEX>, yielding a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">110 bp</ENAMEX> product)
          for the transcript of the human Protamine1 gene, 
          PRM1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank Accession No. NM</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">002761</NUMEX>), which is spermatid-expressed and so should be
          sperm-specific, were used to attempt to amplify the cDNA
          from the epithelial cells. Amplification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">110 bp</ENAMEX>
          fragment of this cDNA would indicate contamination of the
          epididymal cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> was used
          as a positive control.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions for 
          SPAM1 were performed under the
          following conditions: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">94Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min: 39</TIMEX> cycles at 94Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Â°C</ENAMEX> hold. For 
          PRM1 they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          cycles at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>,
          72Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Â°C</ENAMEX> hold. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          resolved on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> agarose gel and stained with ethidium
          bromide, and the experiments were repeated.
        
        
          Sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> product
          The gel-purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were cloned into either
          a pSTBlue-1 vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>) or pCR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-TOPO

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein extracts</ENAMEX> from tissue and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> were prepared
          based on the methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherr et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deng et</ENAMEX>
          al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epididymis</ENAMEX> and vas deferens tissues were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minced</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, shaken, and allowed to gravity settle
          before the supernatant was carefully removed. This was
          repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least six</NUMEX> times or until the washing was
          sperm-free, by microscopic examination. Supernatant was
          retained and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm pelleted</ENAMEX> from it by centrifugation at
          1,000Ã—g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein extracts</ENAMEX> were prepared by

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and Western blot
          Western blot was performed to detect SPAM1 in protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX>. An equal mass of each protein sample was
          subjected to reducing conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">99Â°C</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>

          compare the intensities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein staining</ENAMEX> in the
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the epididymis and the testis, when
          equal amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were loaded. Protein amounts
          were measured using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> assay kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#23227</NUMEX>) and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyaluronic Acid Substrate Gel</ENAMEX>
          Electrophoresis
          Hyaluronidase activities in tissues were measured
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HASGE</ENAMEX> performed as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX> from bovine vitreous humor was
          added to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> SDS-polyacrylamide gel at a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml. Gel was run at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mAmps
          constant current until the leading dye <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (bromophenol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX>) migrated near the bottom. After electrophoresis,
          gels were incubated at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> on a rocking platform to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-48</NUMEX> h. To visualize the
          digestion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX>, gels were stained with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> Alcian blue in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX> h,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">destained</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, and then counterstained with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alcian</ENAMEX> blue and shows a dark blue
          background against an unstained area with digested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX>. The gels were scanned with a laser
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densitometer</ENAMEX>. Images showing the results of the digestion
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX> by hyaluronidase activity present
          were captured by scanning the gels.
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          To confirm the results obtained from the Western
          analysis and to verify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SPAM1</NUMEX>-expressing cell type,
          immunohistochemistry was performed. Paraffin-embedded
          slides were dewaxed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> washes in xylene followed
          by dehydration in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. After dewaxing, some of the
          human tissue sections were stained with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> toluidine
          blue for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> to quench autofluorescence. Tissue
          sections were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in 1x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          (or alternatively <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> and blocked for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>

          temperature in rabbit polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recombinant macaque</ENAMEX> SPAM1 (diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500</ENAMEX> in the blocking
          solution), and then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> each in
          1x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Preimmune rabbit serum was used in place of SPAM1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> as a control. Sections were then incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> in fluorescein isothiocynate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>)-conjugated anti-rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) diluted
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:500</TIMEX> in blocking solution, and then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> each in 1x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. They were then mounted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-phenylenediamine antifade (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/ml</ENAMEX>) with or without
          propidium iodide (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) or DAPI (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) and
          viewed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss</ENAMEX> axiophot fluorescence microscope with
          images taken with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> cooled camera, or with a Zeiss

          In silico analysis of transcription factor binding
          sites
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flanking sequence of human 
          SPAM1 gene was analyzed using the
          TESS program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This web-based program searches for
          putative transcription factor binding sites listed in the
          TRANSFAC database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Statistically significant
          transcription factor binding site matches were returned.
          Those factors that are known to function in the testis or
          epididymis were recorded.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is Present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Epididymal</ENAMEX> Epithelium
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> and Macaques
          In all LM epididymal samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Subjects 1</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> corpus, Subject <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 caput/corpus</ENAMEX>) and macaques (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corpus</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, cauda) the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">320 bp</ENAMEX> 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> fragment was amplified
          in the RT-PCR reactions. The control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) reactions for
          the epithelium as well as the cDNA from the stromal cells
          of Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> gave no <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">320 bp</ENAMEX> product, unlike the test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and the positive control which was from human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genomic DNA (Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp band</ENAMEX> was verified to be
          a human 
          SPAM1 fragment by sequencing.
          Absence of a 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA band</ENAMEX> from the stromal
          cells demonstrates that epididymal 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is localized to the
          tubule epithelium.
          The primers for 
          PRM1 amplified the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">110 bp</ENAMEX>
          product only in the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The absence of this
          sperm-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in the cDNA from the epithelial cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) verifies that the epithelial cells were
          free from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> contamination and that the cDNA amplified
          from the cells is endogenous to the epididymis. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2Bthe results for macaques, which differ from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> nucleotide in the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> bp fragment, show
          a positive band only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (+) reactions, indicating the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contamination from the samples.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, sequencing verified the products to be 
          SPAM1. These results clearly show
          that 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is synthesized in the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caput</ENAMEX>/corpus and the macaque corpus and cauda
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymides</ENAMEX>.
          
          In situ transcript hybridization
          was performed on human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caput</ENAMEX>/corpus epididymis (Subject
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) to confirm the presence of 
          SPAM1 transcript detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM/RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The analysis indicates that the transcript is
          present in the epithelial cells where the purple label
          can be seen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). The mRNA was located predominantly
          in the perinuclear region of the principal cells. Unlike
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">test</ENAMEX> sections hybridized with the antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> sections probed with the sense riboprobe showed
          only the neutral red staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The purple label
          seen in the connective tissue in control and test
          sections may result from endogenous alkaline phosphatase
          activity.
        
        
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protein</ENAMEX> is Present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Primate</ENAMEX> Epididymis
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vas Deferens</ENAMEX>
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was detected by Western blot analysis in
          extracts from testis, epididymis, vas deferens and sperm
          of Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2 and of macaque</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). The intact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64 kDa</NUMEX>) was found in each sample studied.
          Partial degradation products (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~60 kDa</NUMEX>) appear in
          epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. Proteolytically cleaved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX>) was seen in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm samples</ENAMEX>. Also, a low
          molecular weight band (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><50 kDa</NUMEX>) was seen in vas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deferens</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In macaque where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          regions of the epididymis were studied, the levels of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the epididymis were approximately equal to
          that seen in the testis, and the distal regions tended to
          have stronger bands than the caput. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dot blot</ENAMEX> which
          showed that the corpus has the highest level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B) confirmed this tendency. Due to the
          limited availability of fresh human tissue, only the
          caput epididymis was studied. The vas deferens of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> seemed to have lower amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX>.

          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HASGE</ENAMEX>, neutral hyaluronidase activity (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>)
          was demonstrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from the epididymis,

          Hyaluronidase activity was demonstrated by a non-staining
          area corresponding to the size of the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">64 kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In samples from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caput</ENAMEX>, human
          sperm and macaque corpus there was also a narrow band
          with a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>114 kDa</NUMEX>, as indicated by the
          smaller arrow) which may represent dimerization of the
          molecule. This experiment was repeated multiple times,
          and the results seen in Figure 5are a concatenation of
          bands from several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HASGE</ENAMEX> gels.
        
        
          SPAM1 is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunolocalized</ENAMEX> in the Principal Cells of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Epididymal</ENAMEX> Epithelium
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was localized within the human corpus
          (Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) caput and cauda epididymis (Subject
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), using immunohistochemistry. The images were
          taken in the red confocal channel to visualize the
          morphology of the tissues while eliminating the effects
          of autofluorescence. The control slides (A, D, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)
          contain no (or little) green staining, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SPAM1</TIMEX> signal,
          in the epithelium. For the corpus, epithelial staining is
          seen in the test samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>). In C the slide is
          stained with propidium iodide to dye the nuclei red and
          therefore enhance the visualization of the yellow-green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. Note that the yellow-green signal is of a lighter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hue</ENAMEX> and is specific for the epithelium compared with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">darker</ENAMEX> green autofluorescence seen in the stroma. Testis
          sections on the corpus slides were used as positive
          controls and showed the same color pattern as the
          epididymis for the presence and absence of the signal
          (data not shown).
          The epithelium in the caput and cauda test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, E
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, are differentially stained compared to the
          controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>); although the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autofluorescence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> masks some of the green color.
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immuno-staining</ENAMEX> of the sperm in the lumen of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cauda</ENAMEX> sections (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) serves as an internal control,
          being similar in color to the epithelium for the presence
          and absence of the signal.
          For Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#4</NUMEX> where the slides contained sections
          from the vas deferens and seminal vesicle (included by
          Novagen, the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>), the epithelia of these
          tissues were also immuno-stained, indicating the presence
          of SPAM1 (data not shown).
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> studied the epididymal epithelia
          and the sperm in the lumen of test slides were
          consistently a brighter green (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B) than those of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). In the latter the autofluorescence is
          high due to the nature of fixation. In the epididymides
          of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and macaques the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was localized to
          the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the epithelium and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturing sperm</ENAMEX> (positive control).

          Immunohistochemistry analysis of the proximal corpus

          sperm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). This analysis revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> found in the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of immature

          An 
          in silico analysis of the human 
          SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5</ENAMEX>' flanking region was
          performed on the sequence of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 bp genomic</NUMEX> fragment
          previously isolated and cloned in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> from promoter
          walking, and on the human genome database sequence
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>. Several putative transcription factor
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were found which may be used for 
          SPAM1 expression in the epididymis,
          and these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are likely distinct from those used in
          the testis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRE</ENAMEX> (cAMP-responsive
          element) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were found in the more proximal promoter
          region: these are markers for germ cell expression in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testis</ENAMEX>. Particularly interesting is the presence of
          putative androgen responsive elements (AREs), to which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen</ENAMEX> receptor transcription factors bind in response
          to androgens. These results underscore the finding of 
          SPAM1 expression in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Although human 
        SPAM1 mRNA expression is detected by
        Northern analysis only in the testis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> assays
        reveal that the gene is also transcribed in somatic tissues
        where the message is rare. Rare 
        SPAM1 transcripts are however not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquitous</ENAMEX> as revealed by their absence from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovary</ENAMEX>,
        spleen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and murine skeletal muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        . Both rare and abundant 
        SPAM1 transcripts have been found in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplastic</ENAMEX> breast tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and in a number of other
        cancers including pharyngeal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , metastatic melanomas
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gliomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In normal somatic cells rare
        transcripts have been found in breast tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetal</ENAMEX>, placental, and prostate cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Expression in the prostate is relevant to our findings
        in the present study where transcripts were detected in the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caput</ENAMEX>/corpus epididymis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM/RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. This
        technique which has been effectively used to procure
        homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells from tissue sections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] revealed that 
        SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is confined to the
        epididymal epithelium. 
        In situ hybridization demonstrated
        that the transcript is localized in the principal cells,
        confirming its epithelial location, similar to that
        reported for the mouse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . It must be stressed that
        because the probes used in the hybridization were generated
        from the unique <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of 
        SPAM1 cDNA the possibility of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization to paralogous hyaluronidases is highly
        unlikely. This conclusion is supported by unique BLAT
        assignment of the probe sequence to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        .
        SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was found to be present in both the human
        and macaque reproductive tracts. This indicates that in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX> and vas deferens 
        SPAM1 is both transcribed and
        translated. The results from Western analysis of protein
        extracts from the epididymis, which like the vas deferens
        were thoroughly washed to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>, show conclusively
        that intact SPAM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is synthesized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in macaques. It is noteworthy that the
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, representing proteolytically <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleaved</ENAMEX> SPAM1
        was seen only in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> and not in the epididymis or the vas
        which had their own unique degradation products at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~60</NUMEX> kDa
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><50 kDa</NUMEX>, respectively. This suggests that the
        Western results may reveal an isoform that is endogenous to
        each tissue. It also indicates and that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> is not the
        source of epididymal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX>. Also in macaque the intensity
        of the epididymal bands was equal to, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than</NUMEX>, that
        of the testis. This also makes it highly unlikely that
        SPAM1 is present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epididymis</ENAMEX> merely because it is
        transported there from the testis.
        Western blot analysis also suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1 protein</ENAMEX>
        is expressed at higher levels in the distal regions of the
        epididymis, with the highest level of expression in the
        corpus, a region associated with a lower volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>.
        This is supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dot blot</ENAMEX>, with equal protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loading</ENAMEX>, showing the macaque corpus to have the highest
        amount of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX>. This observation not only argues against
        the mere transportation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> into the epididymis, but
        also suggests a region-dependent expression of the gene.
        This finding is consistent with that reported in the mouse
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] where there is differential expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the epididymis with the highest expression in
        the corpus. Expression in the extratesticular pathway seems
        to be lowest in the vas deferens in both human and macaque.
        However, its presence prompted us to examine the vas in the
        mouse where it had not been previously studied: both the
        transcript and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were found (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin-DeLeon et al</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished results). Thus there seems to be a conservation
        of the pattern of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> in the
        extratesticular pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and primates.
        The finding from the Western blots was corroborated by
        those from immunohistochemistry. The latter indicates that
        SPAM1 is associated with the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the
        epithelium, consistent with the localization of the
        transcript and with findings in the mouse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . The
        finding of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> in the seminal vesicle, which was
        examined only because it was included in the tissue series
        on the slides from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Novagen</ENAMEX>, was unexpected but not
        surprising. CD52, a well-known human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymal protein</ENAMEX>, is
        also known to be expressed in the seminal vesicle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        While the expression of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> in the seminal vesicle
        remains to be confirmed, data from our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> have shown that
        the murine 
        Spam1 gene is both transcribed and
        translated in this tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin-DeLeon</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        results).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HASGE</ENAMEX> shows that epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> has neutral
        hyaluronidase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), which is typical only of
        sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hyaluronidase</ENAMEX>. This further supports the identity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed in the epididymis. In general, the
        expression of the enzyme activity was less robust in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX> compared to the testis, and inconclusive for the
        vas deferens. The latter is not surprising because (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        Western analysis showed SPAM1 levels to be the lowest in
        the vas deferens and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) it is reasonable to expect that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HASGE</ENAMEX> is less sensitive than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> analysis. More
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, it is possible that the hyaluronidase activity
        in cells from non-testicular origin may be lower than that
        of the testis due to differences in the pattern of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX>. Variations in glycosylation patterns have
        been shown to exist among tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and glycosylation
        levels have been reported to influence hyaluronidase
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> in the mouse and horse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 32</NUMEX> ] . Note
        that in the mouse, tissue differences in glycosylation
        patterns have been reported for the testis and epididymis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . It is possible that in the epididymis and vas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deferens</ENAMEX> instead of hyaluronidase activity, a more
        important role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX> (which is a glycosidase) may be to
        modify surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> during their maturation.
        Taken together, the data from tissues of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaques</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is both transcribed and translated
        in the epididymal epithelium of primates.
        The finding of conserved expression patterns of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is supported by
        the findings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. Table
        1reveals that in human 
        SPAM1 there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRE</ENAMEX> transcription
        factor binding site, a site that was shown to be functional
        in the murine 
        Spam1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] as well
        as putative AREs which are also present in the mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . Of special interest are the relative locations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AREs</ENAMEX> which are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and the prostate at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-661 and -763</NUMEX>; and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRE</ENAMEX> (cyclic-AMP responsive element) which is consistent
        with haploid expression in the testis at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-207</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The
        relative location of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are consistent with the
        findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hsia et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] who observed that within the
        promoter regions of genes expressed in both the testis and
        the epididymis, the testis-expression elements are more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> to the transcription start site than those
        mediating epididymal expression.
        It should be mentioned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX> are likely to be
        responsible for increasing the basal transcriptional level
        of 
        SPAM1 , leading to the robust
        expression of the mRNA that is detectable with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
        analysis only in the testis. Note that the relevant
        transcriptional binding factor and/or co-activator for CRE
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>) and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX> in the adult (SRY) are
        testis-specific [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . Future studies are necessary to
        determine if the transcriptional binding sites revealed by
        this study are functional in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        In the immunohistochemical studies the sperm
        concentrations in some of the lumen of the tubules in
        sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caput</ENAMEX>/corpus epididymis were low enough to
        allow the observation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> localization on immature
        sperm. Observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> from Subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> of known fertility with an obstruction in
        his corpus epididymis, as well as macaques, revealed that
        SPAM1 is concentrated in the posterior and deficient in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of immature primate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>. This localization
        is quite different from that reported for ejaculated human
        sperm where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is found uniformly over the entire head
        surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Our finding suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> undergoes
        redistribution on the sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> during epididymal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> in primates as it does in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 10</NUMEX> ] , albeit with a reverse order going from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regionalized</ENAMEX> to uniform pattern.

        The finding that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX> with enzymatic activity is
        expressed in the epididymides of three <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species (mice</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and macaques) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of mammals indicates
        that epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is functionally important. It is
        likely that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SPAM1</TIMEX> may play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm maturation</ENAMEX>,
        since its expression is highest in the corpus where a
        number of maturational changes occur [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] . Thus, this
        study increases the biomedical significance of findings
        regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spam1</ENAMEX> in the mouse model. For example, it is
        reasonable to believe that like the mouse, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is
        secreted from the epididymal epithelium with an intact
        lipid anchor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 33</NUMEX> ] and may impact sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maturation</ENAMEX>. It
        should also be noted that a study of the glycosylation and
        2D-gel patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Spam1</NUMEX> from the epididymis and testis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicates that epididymal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spam1</ENAMEX> may be a unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX> rather than a redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Such a
        unique isoform may play a specific role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> maturation
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPAM1</ENAMEX> is the only reproductive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyaluronidase</ENAMEX> in the cluster on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q31</TIMEX>. Currently studies are
        underway to determine the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epididymal Spam1</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
