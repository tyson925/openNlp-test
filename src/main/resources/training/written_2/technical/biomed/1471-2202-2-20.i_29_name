        Estrogen as a neuroprotective and neurotrophic factor:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) influences memory and cognition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) attenuates
        the extent of cell death resulting from brain injuries
        (i.e., from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular stroke</ENAMEX> and neurotrauma) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] and, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) decreases the risk and delays the onset of
        neurological disorders such as, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ]
        . Numerous studies indicate that estrogen is essential for
        optimal brain function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , as estrogen has been
        shown to increase cerebral blood flow [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , act
        as an anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , and enhance
        activity at neuronal synapses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Through a
        variety of mechanisms, estrogen strongly influences memory
        and cognition; a type of cognition, which is especially
        dependant on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gonadal hormones</ENAMEX> (i.e. estradiol), is visual
        spatial memory (VSM) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        In learning and memory tasks, which require the use of
        visual spatial cues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> acquire and exhibit superior
        performance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . This
        sex difference in rats has been attributed to the hormonal
        influence of estrogen (presumably by way of its 
        in situ conversion from testosterone
        by the aromatase enzyme in brain) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] , and is
        observable morphologically in visually spatial critical
        brain areas (i.e. frontal cortex & <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hippocampus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ]
        In this regard, endocrine disrupters are environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that mimic or modulate the physiological effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX>, especially that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogens</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ]
        . Of all of the considered estrogenic endocrine disrupters
        examined thus far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> have been extensively
        studied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] (however, little research has been
        conducted examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> in relationship to phytoestrogens).
        Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that are structurally
        and functionally similar to estradiol and have the ability
        to selectively bind estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> Î²
        greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor Î±</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ). Phytoestrogens
        have received increased investigative attention due to
        their potential protective effects against age-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">e.g. cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> and osteoporosis) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hormone-dependent cancers</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] ). These
        estrogen-like molecules (with a diphenolic nonsteroidal
        structure) are found in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but are especially
        abundant in soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] which are used as the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in all
        natural<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-ingredient</ENAMEX>, commercially available, rodent diets
        (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 to 600 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> diet [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] ). Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> ingesting these diets are
        continually exposed to endocrine-active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 39</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] .
        The available research regarding cognitive function and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> suggests that large amounts of
        phytoestrogens, consumed as tofu, have an adverse influence
        on cognitive ability in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, where decreased brain weight,
        increased ventricular size and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> have been reported
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . In ovariectomized female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, on the other hand,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> treatments resulted in a dose-dependent
        improvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . This improvement in cognitive
        ability in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> may be due in part
        to the increased presence of choline acetyltransferase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messenger RNA</ENAMEX> in the frontal cortex, which has been shown
        to be associated with protection and enhancement of
        cognitive function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, we have shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> significantly affect the brain
        calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein calbindin</ENAMEX> (CALB), which acts as a
        buffer by binding intracellular calcium and plays an
        important role in mediating cell proliferation, programmed
        cell death (apoptosis), and neurotoxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX>
        ] . This neuroprotective mechanism via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> appears to be
        important in neurological disorders such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington's disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] .
        Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyclooxygenase-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>) seems to play an
        important role in mediating functional neuronal maturation
        and responses to certain stimuli in the brain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX> ]
        . The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is associated with key
        pathophysiologic events in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>: deposition
        of beta-amyloid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in neuritic plaques within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> and cortex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX> ] . Of particular
        importance to this study is the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to be influenced by steroidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> in the frontal cortex
        may also be hormonally regulated and relevant to cognitive
        decline.
        The design of this study was to examine the influence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> (present via soy in rodent diets) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate experiments utilizing radial arm maze
        methods to examine varying aspects of memory. Additionally,
        brain regions critical for diverse parameters of VSM
        (working vs. reference memory) were assayed to determine
        phytoestrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> levels. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has
        previously reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the phytoestrogen</TIMEX> levels in the diets
        used in this study and circulating plasma and brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> levels obtained in rats exposed to these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diets</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] . Notably, we have shown that rats
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet have phytoestrogen plasma levels
        similar to that of a human <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> consuming high
        amounts of soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> per day and the low levels of plasma
        phytoestrogens from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free diet fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are
        reflective of a Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> where soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are
        rarely consumed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 40 42</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, we have
        established an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model that approaches the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in circulating plasma phytoestrogen levels based
        upon consumption of these phytoestrogen (soy-rich vs.
        soy-free) diets.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX> in

            Experiments <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 & 2</ENAMEX>
            Dietary phytoestrogens did not alter working memory
            as assessed by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-arm task in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">males</ENAMEX> ( 
            p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX> respectively; data
            not shown) when these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> by diet were tested
            separately (by sex). Therefore, an across sex by diet
            comparison was not appropriate for these separate data
            sets.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experiment 3</ENAMEX>
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were tested within the same
            experiment (and exposed to the same diet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX>,
            again before the diet switch), consistent with previous
            reports, on sexual dimorphism in the radial arm maze,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">males</ENAMEX> performed with more accuracy than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-arm task. A significant sex difference was found on
            maze performance in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-arm task (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Experiment 3 Four-Arm Task</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">baited/unbaited</ENAMEX>)
          In contrast, on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-arm task, male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> dominance
          appeared to be dependant upon diet (or after the diet
          switch). Multivariate analysis of variance resulted in a
          significant interaction of sex and diet (

          shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Further multivariate statistical
          analysis and post hoc comparisons were used to identify
          differences in errors committed in the radial-arm maze.
          These data revealed a significant interaction of sex and
          diet on the incidence of reference errors during trials
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-12 and 13-15</NUMEX> (

          revealed that lifelong fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> committed
          significantly more reference memory errors than males

          Phyto-600 diet traveled through the maze significantly
          faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free diet (trials

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brain Content-Phytoestrogen Levels</ENAMEX>
          Brain phytoestrogen levels are displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          In general, in all brain regions examined (except the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX>) Phyto-600 fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> displayed significantly
          higher phytoestrogen levels compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free fed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. In the amygdala, phytoestrogen levels were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold
          higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free values.
          Whereas, in the hippocampus there was not a significant

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. However, when the frontal cortex and cerebellum
          were examined, where an abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ER-Î² receptors</ENAMEX> are
          present, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> displayed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47-fold and 9</NUMEX>-fold
          higher phytoestrogens levels, respectively, compared to
          Phyto-free male values. In each brain site examined
          (except the cerebellum), the major phytoestrogen
          metabolite was equol and there were relatively low levels
          of daidzein and genistein.

          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> from male <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> rats
          was significantly lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free diet
          ( 
          F (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,10</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.7</NUMEX>, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). This suggests that
          high levels of dietary phytoestrogens significantly
          decreased frontal cortical CALB levels in male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
          however, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, there was no significant diet effect
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> levels and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> intensities were similar to
          males fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet.
          In examining hippocampal CALB levels between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-600
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vs. Phyto</ENAMEX>-free fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, there were no significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in CALB levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CA 1, CA 3</ENAMEX> or dentate
          gyms regions by the diet treatments (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frontal Cortex COX</ENAMEX>-2
          Western analysis of the same frontal cortex samples
          (as performed for the CALB <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> analysis) revealed
          significantly lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free males
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> ( 
          F (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,10</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.7</NUMEX>, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). These results are
          presented in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. This suggests that high levels of
          dietary phytoestrogens significantly increased the
          abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> in the male rat frontal cortex. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX>, similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> results above, there was no
          significant diet effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> levels and the band
          intensities were almost identical to that of male
          Phyto-free values.
          Note: Due to the low abundance of phytoestrogens in
          the hippocampus, in both diet treatments, analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> was not preformed. Furthermore, in preliminary
          experiments hippocampal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> signals, via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>
          analysis, were too weak to quantify.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Phytoestrogen research has grown rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>
        due to its potential health benefits in preventing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">age-related</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . In contrast very little research
        has been conducted to identify phytoestrogen effects on
        cognitive behavior. Because phytoestrogens are present in
        virtually all natural<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-ingredient</ENAMEX> rodent diets that use soy
        as a source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 38</NUMEX> ] , and since these
        compounds are endocrine-active [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] , it is important to determine whether the amounts
        present in rodent diets are sufficient to affect sexually
        dimorphic spatial ability.
        The present study addressed these issues, in part, by
        investigating the influence of dietary phytoestrogens
        (present in a normal rodent diet), on visual spatial
        ability. In tasks requiring the use of spatial skills, a
        sexually dimorphic difference has been consistently
        demonstrated in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> reliably outperform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . This sex difference is most likely due
        to the presence of testosterone or more likely its
        metabolite estradiol, in brain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ]
        . Because phytoestrogens have the ability to bind estrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and alter many of the biological responses that
        are evoked by physiological estrogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 39 40 41 42 43</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] , we determined phytoestrogens affects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult rats</ENAMEX>. Measurements of accuracy in acquisition
        (determined as trials required for shaping to a
        predetermined criterion) of the radial maze were diet
        dependent in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (in experiment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) fed the
        phytoestrogen-free diet and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (in experiment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) fed
        the phytoestrogen-rich diet acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX> in fewer days
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the alternate diet. It should be
        noted that the dietary effects on body weight are the same
        for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and therefore, do not account
        for the sexually dimorphic maze performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . There
        was, however, no significant dietary effects observed in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-arm task performance in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (experiment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (experiment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Measures of accuracy on the
        baited/unbaited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm task (experiment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) demonstrated
        that a diet change in young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult animals</ENAMEX> (a change from
        Phyto-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free) had a positive influence on the
        accuracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, but a negative influence on the accuracy
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> paper, the impact of hormonal
        manipulation and dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX>' influence on VSM
        is examined and validates several aspects of the findings
        from the present study.
        The discrepancies in maze performance were expressed in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Phyto-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (exposed lifelong to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>) committed more reference errors than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> switched
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free diet and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> fed males
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> had increased mobility within the maze which
        seemed to be advantageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> but disruptive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. It is intriguing to speculate that, the increase in
        reference errors, but not working or working/reference
        errors, suggests that disruption of maze performance is
        occurring within the frontal cortex (but not the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX>) of lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. The drop in
        performance is directly correlated to phytoestrogen levels
        in brain and the effects of phytoestrogens on brain CALB
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> levels, in that phytoestrogens were identified as
        having a negative relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.942</NUMEX>) and a
        positive relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.974</NUMEX>). In all other
        studies conducted previously the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> in the diet, circulating in plasma and
        especially in brain have not been performed together. The
        exception to this line of investigation has been our
        laboratory, where, in general, we obtained similar values
        previously to those quantified in the present study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 42</NUMEX>
        ] , when overlapping diet exposure and brain regions were
        examined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sprague-Dawley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 51</NUMEX> ]
        .
        As reported, phytoestrogens were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> times higher in the
        frontal cortex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> where
        there is an abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ER-Î² receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> levels were similar in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the
        hippocampal region. Furthermore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-600
        diet displayed a significant decrease in frontal cortical
        CALB levels in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> receiving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> plays an important role in regulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraneuronal</ENAMEX> cellular calcium, which protects against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurodegenerative disease</ENAMEX> and defends against apoptosis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] , a decrease in frontal cortex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> may
        result in cognitive impairment due to cell death or
        abnormal calcium homeostasis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, frontal cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> was shown to
        significantly increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet.
        Because the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is associated with key
        pathophysiologic event(s) in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX>
        ] , the significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in the
        frontal cortex may be relevant to the cognitive decline
        seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. In this regard, it is known
        that the hormonal action of estrogens may be mediated by
        the differential expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors alpha</ENAMEX> vs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">betta</ENAMEX> in brain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that activate or inhibit cell
        death mechanisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Although, this parameter was not
        directly investigated in this study, the differing
        influence that dietary phytoestrogens had on CALB
        (significant decrease) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> (significant increase) in
        the male frontal cortex, suggests that phytoestrogens may
        activate programmed cell death. In support of this notion,
        since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> displayed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>-fold greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> levels in the frontal cortex (vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>) and the greater affinity of phytoestrogens is for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-Î² > ER-Î±</ENAMEX>, it has been shown that estrogen-related
        neuronal apoptosis is determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-Î² and the Fas</ENAMEX>/Fas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . In fact isoflavones have been shown
        to cause apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> primary cortical neurons in vitro
        via a calcium dependant mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, the
        action of phytoestrogens may be tissue site specific. As
        our results show phytoestrogens are more prevalent and have
        greater affinity for certain brain structures and areas,
        therefore, phytoestrogens may act both as agonist and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX> in a site-specific manner or in other words as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural SERM</ENAMEX>-type molecules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 38 39 40 41 42</NUMEX> ] .
        Taken together these findings suggest that soy dietary
        phytoestrogens present in the animal diets or the lack
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thereof</ENAMEX>, for a relatively short interval even in young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult animals</ENAMEX>, can significantly influence sexually
        dimorphic cognitive behavior. Dietary phytoestrogens sex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversed VSM</ENAMEX>, as expressed in the radial-arm maze by
        enhancing spatial memory in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> but inhibited this
        ability in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, this finding corresponds to research
        regarding increased dementia observed in aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> consuming
        high tofu levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . However, while it is important to
        establish the influence of dietary phytoestrogens on brain
        function and behavior in animal models, the true
        significance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> remains to be determined as it
        relates to the present findings.
        Finally, as established by the above findings, of
        particular importance which deserves emphasis is that the
        Phyto-600 diet, used in this study, is a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> chow
        formulation that is similar to other rodent diet products
        that are used in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, whereas,
        phytoestrogen-free (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Phyto</ENAMEX>-free) diets are rarely used. As
        previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thigpen et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Setchell</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and concentration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> in rodent diets. The results of this study
        showed that phytoestrogen concentrations vary widely among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 200</NUMEX> Î¼g/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g and 600 Î¼g/g</ENAMEX> of phytoestrogens).
        Additionally, one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> has quantified
        phytoestrogen plasma levels in a variety of physiologic
        conditions validating the importance of soy-derived
        phytoestrogens via rodent chow diets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Therefore not
        all diets have the same phytoestrogen levels, however, all
        diets, which have soy as their main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX>. It is very unusual to consider the
        influence of diet in hormone sensitive research
        investigations. This may be a critical error due to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complicating</ENAMEX> and/or confounding role phytoestrogens play.
        For example, we have previously shown that soy dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> significantly alter body weight, food and
        water intake levels, puberty onset in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and prostate
        weights [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Also, we have preliminary (unpublished)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> demonstrating the effects of soy-derived
        phytoestrogens on several endocrine and metabolic
        parameters. However, brain aromatase and circulating plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> levels in male rats does not appear to be
        influenced by dietary phytoestrogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 41 51</NUMEX> ] . As the
        results from this research imply, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> have
        considerable effects on hormonally sensitive parameters and
        their influence may be, in part, responsible for many
        reported sexual dimorphisms such as, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> and
        plasticity of sexually dimorphic brain structures like the
        sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA)
        and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, dietary soy derived phytoestrogens can
        influence brain, cognition and memory in a manner that was
        previously unknown, where soy phytoestrogens enhance memory
        in intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> but inhibit memory in intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.
        Further research is warranted in order to examine this
        important and growing research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> of endocrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disruptors</ENAMEX> to determine the true significance of
        phytoestrogens influence that appears to be hormonal and
        gender dependent.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Male rats acquire and exhibit significantly better
        performance compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in learning and memory task
        requiring the use of visual spatial cues. This study,
        examined the influence of phytoestrogens, present in rodent
        diets, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> and identified phytoestrogens, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> brain. Within the radial arm
        maze dietary phytoestrogens significantly sex-reversed the
        normal sexually dimorphic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX>. Specifically,
        in tasks requiring the use of reference, but not working,
        memory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX> was enhanced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet,
        whereas, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> VSM was inhibited by the same diet. It
        was determined (via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TR-FIA</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phyto</ENAMEX>-600
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> had significantly higher levels of phytoestrogens in a
        number of brain regions (frontal cortex, hypothalamus &
        cerebellum, but not hippocampus) compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the
        Phyto-free diet. Since reference memory is thought to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> in the frontal cortex and because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the
        Phyto-600 diet had decreased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> (a
        neuroprotectant factor) and increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> (an
        inflammatory factor prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>)
        levels in this brain region compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> fed the
        Phyto-free diet, these findings suggest that
        phytoestrogens, present in soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dietary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, may alter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VSM</ENAMEX> via there presence and action in the frontal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods

          Experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> were conducted independent of each
          other, however, they were conducted at similar time

          experiments <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>). However, the diet treatments were
          switched after acquisition and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-arm maze procedures
          (see below) in order to examine the plasticity of visual

            limited feeding schedule and maintained at
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 90%</NUMEX> of normal body weight; however,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were allowed to gain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 5</TIMEX> g per week
            to account for normal growth. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One week later</TIMEX>, the rats
            were introduced to the radial arm maze. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was placed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX> for
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> to explore. Following this introduction, rats
            were placed, alone, in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Froot Loops</ENAMEX> (FL) were placed at the start of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat retrieved FL</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> of the piles
            within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX>, then on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX> a single FL
            was placed at the start of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> FL

            a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX> was placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cm further out on the arms. In
            this manner, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLs</ENAMEX> were gradually placed farther and
            farther out on the arms in a systematic manner.
            Training was completed for a given rat when it
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrieved FLs</ENAMEX> from the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> arms
            within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> consecutive trials. The number of
            trials required to reach this criterion was recorded
            for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. Once this criterion level was reached,
            for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, it was tested on this task for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
            additional trials, one/day. Each trial was considered
            complete when all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were visited, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> had
            passed. An arm choice was scored if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> traveled
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three-fourths</ENAMEX> of the way down the length of an arm. A
            working memory error was recorded if an animal
            reentered a previously visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Following the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-arm task the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in experiments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacrificed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was taken to determine circulating
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogen</ENAMEX> levels and brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were collected
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>.
            In experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>, following the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-arm task trials
            described above these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were returned to their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home cages</ENAMEX> and a dietary change was initiated. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One-half</ENAMEX>
            the total number of male or female (random cycling)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was kept on the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phyto-600</ENAMEX> diet
            (long-term) and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> was assigned to the
            Phyto-free diet (short-term). This ad lib feeding
            continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX>. Following this ad lib period of
            feeding, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were again reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of normal body
            weight for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>.
          
          
            Maze procedure (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm task; reference and
            working memory) examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in experiment
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
            Following the reduction to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of normal body
            weight, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was tested for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 15 days</TIMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial/day, during which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were baited
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm task). To begin these trial, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was
            placed in a bottomless, opaque box in the center of the
            maze. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> was removed opening all arms
            simultaneously to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. These trials were considered
            complete when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">baited arms</ENAMEX> (arms <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,6 and 8</NUMEX>) had
            been visited or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> had passed. During all trials
            the amount of time required to visit the initial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> arms
            and the order that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were
            recorded. Again an arm entry was noted if a rat
            traversed at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-fourths</NUMEX> the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
            A working memory error was recorded if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> reentered
            a baited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, a reference memory error was recorded if
            an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> entered an arm, which was not baited, and a
            working/reference memory error was recorded if an
            animal reentered an arm, which was not baited. All
            testing and analysis was accomplished without knowledge
            of the diet treatments.
          
          
            Circulating phytoestrogen levels
            The concentration and types of phytoestrogens in
            collected plasma samples were analyzed by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>-chromatography/mass spectrometry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/MS</ENAMEX>), as
            previously performed in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 40 51</NUMEX> ] .
            This was accomplished by liquid-solid extraction and
            liquid-gel chromatographic techniques to isolate the
            phytoestrogen fractions using standard assay methods
            with internal controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calbindin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> and phytoestrogen
            levels
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> rats, brains tissues were collected
            for phytoestrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> analysis. Brain
            phytoestrogen concentrations (i.e., daidzein, genistein
            and equol) were determined in tissues isolated from the
            frontal cortex and hippocampus (brain structures
            critical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSM</ENAMEX>) along with the amygdala and
            cerebellum brain regions, by time-resolved
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluoroimmunoassay</ENAMEX> (TR-FIA) using standard methods based
            on previously published and validated methods for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX> and urine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 60</NUMEX> ] . The brain tissue method
            (in brief) follows: The brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were lyophilized
            (pooled by treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) from male rats
            used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> that were on the diet treatments from
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 to 120 days of age</TIMEX>. Following addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 Î¼l</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and mixing, the samples were left at room
            temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, and thereafter carefully mixed
            and sonicated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tritiated</ENAMEX> estradiol
            glucuronide was added as an internal standard and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>
            Î¼l of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> were mixed with samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatty</ENAMEX> material
            was precipitated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
            then centrifuged (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3500</TIMEX> rpm) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-10Â°C</TIMEX> and the
            supernatant was decanted into another tube. The
            procedure was repeated by adding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional 1 ml</NUMEX>,
            ice-cold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>, mixing, centrifugating in the
            cold, and decanting the supernatant into the tube
            containing the extract. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methanol</ENAMEX> was evaporated under a
            stream of nitrogen until only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> remained. The
            samples were extracted once with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> ml of n-hexane,
            which removed the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> (the remaining n-hexane
            was removed with nitrogen). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helix Pomatia</ENAMEX> enzyme was
            purified with activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">charcoal</ENAMEX> and used for enzymatic
            hydrolysis of the phytoestrogen conjugates. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 h at 60Â°C</NUMEX>) was carried out using ascorbic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> acetate buffer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were then
            extracted twice with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml of diethylether, freezing
            separated the phases and the ether fractions were
            combined and evaporated. After adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> Î¼l of TRIS
            buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.76</NUMEX> (TR-FIA buffer) a sample was taken for
            measurement of recovery in a Î²-counter. The final assay
            was carried out as described elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] .
            Equol was determined in the same way genistein and
            daidzein, using an antiserum to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">O-carboxymethyl-equol</ENAMEX>-bovine serum albumin and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Europium</ENAMEX> label was synthesized using the same
            derivative of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">equol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . The cross-reactivities of
            the genistein and daidzein antisera with other
            isoflavone metabolites have been described previously [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ] . The equol antiserum showed a cross reactivity of
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> for genistein, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> for dihydrogenistein, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dihydrodaidzein</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> for daidzein and its
            other metabolites. The intra-assay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> determined, from
            a pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> brains, varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.5%</NUMEX>. The
            relatively high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> was due to the fact that the samples
            were never completely homogeneous and the differences
            in phytoestrogen concentrations are great in different
            brain regions.
            In male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> from experiments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CALB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> levels in the frontal cortex and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> (CALB only) were determined using Western
            blot analysis, as reported elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 55</NUMEX> ] . In
            brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homogenized samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼g</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> for frontal

              Acquisition
              A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
              evaluate acquisition of the radial-arm maze based on
              the number of trials needed for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> to meet the
              specified level of performance.

              A multivariate analysis of variance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANOVA</ENAMEX>; sex
              over trials <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Ã 5</ENAMEX>) was used to determine accuracy of
              the initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> trials (each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> trials were averaged).
              Accuracy was defined as the number of correct arm

              Accuracy on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm task was determined by
              the number of correct arm choices (baited arms not
              yet chosen in the trial) made in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> arm
              entries. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANOVA</ENAMEX> (sex by diet change over trials <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Ã
              <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Ã 5</ENAMEX>) was used to interpret these findings (each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
              trials were averaged). Also a sex by diet over trials
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANOVA</ENAMEX> was completed to determine the number and
              types of errors committed in the initial 4 arm
              entries.
              All analyses were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> statistical
              software package and all significant main effects
              were followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> post hoc comparisons. The
              alpha level was set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
