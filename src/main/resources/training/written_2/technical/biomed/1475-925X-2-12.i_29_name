        The term "radiofrequency ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>" refers to a
        class of medical devices operating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 460</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</NUMEX> kHz that
        deliver therapeutic energy into soft tissues. The intent of
        these devices is to thermally necrose tissue by raising
        targeted tissue temperatures to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 100°C</NUMEX> for a
        period of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-15 minutes</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Ablation probes are
        inserted percutaneously or subdermally into tissues where
        cancerous tumors have been identified. Once the probes are
        positioned, radiofrequency energy is delivered through the
        probe, into surrounding tissue, and to an electrical ground
        pad that is applied to the skin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        As a technique, the use of radiofrequency energy in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablation</ENAMEX> procedures has been well established. However, its
        use in treating tumors in soft organs, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>,
        presents some new constraints that were not common to its
        previous uses. In cardiac ablation, for example, the goal
        of the ablation procedure is to eradicate the tissue
        pathology needed to sustain an arrhythmia, or abnormal
        heart rhythm [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . By monitoring changes in shape of
        the electrograms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> can determine when procedures
        are complete. In contrast, the absence of a natural
        real-time feedback parameter in hepatic tumor ablation
        makes it difficult to assess completion of an ablation
        procedure. A surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endpoint</ENAMEX> is the necrosis of a tissue
        area much larger than the size of the tumor to insure that
        all cancerous cells within the volume are eradicated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . To achieve this endpoint requires a good understanding of
        the mechanism of ablation. Our present understanding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablation</ENAMEX> is mainly derived from experiences with other
        medical devices such as hyperthermia and electrosurgical
        units [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , which function differently than
        radiofrequency ablation devices.
        The intent of microwave hyperthermia devices (operating
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 MHz</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.45</NUMEX> GHz) is to raise the temperature of
        tumorous tissues to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 43-45°C</TIMEX> for extended periods of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on the order of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microwave</ENAMEX> hyperthermia
        devices deliver energy at low doses of energy over long
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods of time</TIMEX>; whereas, radiofrequency ablation devices
        deliver high doses of energy for short periods of time [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microwave</ENAMEX> hyperthermia devices and radiofrequency
        ablation devices differ in other important ways. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dielectric</ENAMEX> properties of hepatic tissue in the microwave
        frequency range differ greatly from those at
        radiofrequencies, resulting in a substantially different
        depth of penetration of energy. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> kHz, liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.148</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/m.</ENAMEX> By comparison,
        liver conductivity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.45</NUMEX> GHz are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.382</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1.687 S/m</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . As a result, for
        comparable source strengths, current disperses more readily
        into tissue at higher frequencies. Thus, at higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>, heating patterns are more spread out and tend
        to deliver lesser heating than at lower frequencies.
        Another important difference between microwave hyperthermia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX> and hepatic radiofrequency ablation devices is the
        mode of energy transfer. At microwave frequencies, energy
        is primarily transferred to tissue via capacitive coupling
        (field heating) which causes vibration of particles in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, resulting in tissue heating. At frequencies used
        by radiofrequency ablation devices, energy is transferred
        primarily by conductive (ohmic) heating, where current is
        generated through the movement of charge from the ablation
        probe to the electrical ground plate via the path of least
        resistance.
        In electrosurgical devices, high bursts of energy are
        used for short periods of time to achieve cutting and
        coagulative effects on tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Electrosurgical devices and radiofrequency ablation probes
        both operate within the same frequency range and transfer
        energy in similar ways, but differ in the shape of
        stimulation waveforms. Radiofrequency ablation devices
        utilize a continuous sinusoidal waveform. Electrosurgical
        devices use variable waveform shape and duty cycle duration
        to achieve fulguration, cutting, or desiccation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        In general the application of energy with electrosurgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX> is intense for an extremely short period of time
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several seconds</TIMEX>). Thus, the temperatures achieved by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrosurgical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> do not penetrate as deeply into
        tissue as radiofrequency ablation devices.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the use of computational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for
        radiofrequency ablation has risen as a means of studying
        the dosiometric and heat transfer profiles surrounding the
        ablation probes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, however, have
        varied considerably from experimental measurement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ]
        . There are several contributing factors for these
        variations: metabolism, blood flow, tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>, and
        motion. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> additional explanation for inaccuracies in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is the use of constant electrical properties
        of tissues in modeling. There are no known studies to date
        that specifically study the effects of temperature
        dependent electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> on the dosimetric and heat
        transfer profiles surrounding ablation probes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Perhaps the greatest reason for assuming constant
        electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> is the enormous computational
        advantage of being able to separate the electromagnetic and
        heat transfer problems. By separating the two problems,
        computational resources can be reduced significantly by
        sequentially solving the electric field and temperature
        distribution. A constant electrical conductivity
        necessitates a constant electric field and current density
        and, thus, imposes a one-way coupling between the
        electrical and thermal problems. More specifically, the
        thermal calculation is dependent on the calculation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, whereas, the electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> is
        independent of the thermal profile.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have shown that the electrical
        conductivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> is temperature-dependent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The magnitude of this effect is also material and frequency
        dependent. When temperature-dependent electrical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> is applied to computational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
        bi-directional coupling is imposed between electrical and
        thermal problems. Thus, the thermal profile and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> are interdependent. The purpose of this
        study is to determine to what extent simplification of
        constant electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> can be used and to determine
        the amount of error that results when temperature-dependent
        effects are ignored.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temperature-Dependent Conductivity</ENAMEX>
          Since, to date, there have been no formal experimental
          measurements on the temperature-dependence of the
          electrical conductivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, we have assumed that
          the temperature-dependent behavior of liver tissue is
          similar to that of an equivalent sodium chloride
          solution. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stogryn</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] derived expressions for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity (σ</ENAMEX>) of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride solutions</ENAMEX> at given

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Δ</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-T</NUMEX>. Using this established relationship, we
          chose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> concentration that produced an equivalent
          electrical conductivity of liver tissues at 37°C
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.134</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/m</ENAMEX>). The rationale for using NaCl
          solutions stems from several known phenomena. First,
          liver tissue has high water content. As a first-order
          approximation, liver can be modeled as compartmental
          areas containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt solutions</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it has been
          reported that at low frequencies, the electrical
          properties of tissue are dominated mainly by the
          electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductivity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The electrical
          permittivity, which is more closely related to the
          cellular structure of cells, is a much smaller component
          to tissue impedance than the electrical conductivity and
          can be ignored in a first-order calculation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions</ENAMEX>
          Radiofrequency ablation probes operate between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460</NUMEX>-550
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kHz</ENAMEX>. At these frequencies, the wavelength is several
          orders of magnitude larger than the size of the ablation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrode</ENAMEX>. Thus, the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> dissipates the
          majority of its energy through electrical conduction and
          not capacitive coupling. In this situation, we assumed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasi-static</ENAMEX> electrical conduction model, which allows us
          to solve the electric field by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace</ENAMEX>'s
          equation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">∇·[σ</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> )∇ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> ] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Eq.2</NUMEX>)
          where ∇ is the gradient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator (∇φ</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">∂φ/∂ x + ∂φ/∂ y</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ ∂φ/∂ z</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) is the temperature-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemens</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> is the electric
          potential (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volts</ENAMEX>).
          Heat transfer in tissue is governed by the heat
          conduction equation
          
          where ρ is the density (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 3</ENAMEX>), 
          c is the heat capacity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J/kg-K</ENAMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is the heat conduction coefficient
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W/K-m</ENAMEX>), ρ 
          b is the density of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, C 
          b is the heat capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, ω is
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood perfusion coefficient</ENAMEX>, T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amb</ENAMEX> is the ambient temperature, and Q 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is the metabolic heat source term.
          For all cases, we assumed that the metabolic heat source
          was insignificant. In the cases where blood perfusion
          were ignored, ω = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Since our main interest is to
          simulate the highest temperatures achieved during
          radiofrequency ablation, we considered only the steady
          state problem.
          The difference in the methodology used to solve these
          governing equations for the cases of constant and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature-dependent</ENAMEX> conductivity stems from the method
          in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace</ENAMEX>'s equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 2</ENAMEX>) is solved. In
          the case where the electrical conductivity is a constant,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace</ENAMEX>'s equation can be rearranged such that σ∇ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2V</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.
          Since the rearranged expression is not a function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, it can be solved independently of the heat
          conduction equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 3</ENAMEX>). The expression for the
          electric potential (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) can be solved quickly over the
          entire volume and the solution can be implemented into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> term of the heat conduction equation. Since
          temperature is a function of position and is not uniform
          over the volume, the electrical conductivity is a
          function of both temperature and position in the case of
          temperature-dependence. In this situation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equations</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> must be simultaneously solved which involves
          iterative computation of both the electrical conductivity
          and the temperature.
          In both the temperature-dependent conductivity and
          constant conductivity <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the boundary conditions
          were the same. For each of the outer surfaces of the
          model, an electrical boundary condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V = 0</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>, to simulate the return ground electrode. A
          source potential (V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> ) was applied to the conducting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The non-conducting portions were
          given an insulating boundary condition such that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n ·(σ∇</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>; where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> vector normal to the
          surface, σ is the electrical conductivity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> is the
          voltage at the insulating surface. The thermal boundary
          conditions for the surface of the box were T = T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amb</ENAMEX> . Since the thermal mass of the
          probe was small compared to the surrounding saline, we
          assumed that heat conduction into the probe itself was
          minimal. Thus, for all other surfaces, the thermally
          insulating boundary condition 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n ·</ENAMEX>(k∇T) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was applied.
        
        
          Solver Method
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> finite element <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were compared: constant
          electrical conductivity without tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature-dependent</ENAMEX> conductivity without tissue
          perfusion, constant electrical conductivity with tissue
          perfusion, and temperature-dependent conductivity with
          tissue perfusion.
          To solve these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, we used an iterative finite
          element multigrid solver with an initial coarse grid of
          8,787 nodes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,045</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>) cycles
          were necessary to converge the solution resulting in a
          fine grid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34,452</NUMEX> nodes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178,389</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. For each
          run, the electric field (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>), the current density (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>), the
          heat flux (HF), and the resulting temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) were
          calculated. The electrical conductivity (σ = <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J/E</ENAMEX>) and the
          specific absorption rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J·E</ENAMEX>) were also
          calculated. Simulations were made for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          models with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> voltages of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> volts. Additional simulations were made
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.0</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.5</NUMEX> volts for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with
          tissue perfusion to attain simulation data near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX>.
          All of these calculations were implemented using FEMLAB
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burlington MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHz Intel</ENAMEX> Pentium

        strengths computed for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> when a source
        voltage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.0</NUMEX> volts is applied. In each case, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> is shown to be non-uniform, favoring the
        proximal edge and the distal tip of the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The
        maximum electric field occurs at the proximal edge. In the
        results from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models that assume constant electrical
        conductivity, the maximum electric field is the same. The
        models that assume a temperature-dependent electrical
        conductivity have an electric field strength that is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3%</NUMEX> less. Figure 4shows a plot of the maximum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> field strength plotted as a function of source
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voltage</ENAMEX>. For the cases that use constant conductivity, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> is directly proportional to the magnitude of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. As the source voltage increases, the
        differences between the model results of the constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> and temperature-dependent conductivity models
        increase. The nonlinearity in the results for
        temperature-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conductivity</ENAMEX> arise from solving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace</ENAMEX>'s equation using the more general expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">∇·[σ</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T)∇V</ENAMEX>] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Tables 4and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5demonstrate</TIMEX> that the changes
        in the electric field are not related to tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>.
        A plot of the electric field strength along the surface of
        the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) shows that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
        models, the resulting distribution of the electric field is
        nearly the same.
        Figure 6shows a comparison of the maximum current
        density computed for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.0</NUMEX> volts is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>. In the cases where the electrical conductivity is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, the current density is a linear scaling of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and is the same with and without tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX>. For the case where temperature-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> is applied in the absence of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>,
        the current density increases <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">120%</NUMEX>. When perfusion is added
        to the temperature-dependent conductivity model, the
        current density increases <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 53%</NUMEX>. These data
        indicate that current density is explicitly related to
        temperature-dependent phenomena and implicitly related to
        tissue perfusion. Therefore, any changes in the current
        density due to perfusion are only observable if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temperature-dependent</ENAMEX> electrical conductivity is accounted
        for in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">computational</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Figures 7and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8demonstrate</TIMEX> that
        in both of the cases with (green) and without (red) tissue
        perfusion which utilize constant electrical conductivity,
        the current density distribution is the same. The figures
        also indicate that adding temperature-dependent and
        perfusion phenomena produce substantially different
        results.
        A major consequence of accounting for
        temperature-dependent phenomena is the large change in the
        electrical conductivity. Figures 9and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10show</TIMEX> that the
        electrical conductivity change considerably when
        temperature-dependence is accounted for (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">128%</NUMEX> without
        perfusion, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> with perfusion). As seen in the results for
        current density, the electrical conductivity is explicitly
        related to temperature-dependent phenomena and implicitly
        related to tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11shows</NUMEX> the
        distribution of temperature-dependent electrical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> along the surface of the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. For
        the case where tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> is neglected, the center of
        the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is the area with the largest
        conductivity change. When tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> is accounted
        for, the areas corresponding to the proximal edge and the
        distal tip experience the most change. Figure 12shows a
        three-dimensional representation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature-dependent</ENAMEX> conductivity change with no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX>. The figure shows a rapid decrease in the
        conductivity change in the radial direction.
        The changes in the electric field, current density, and
        electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductivity</ENAMEX> contribute to changes in the
        specific absorption rate (SAR). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> is the mass
        normalized rate of electromagnetic energy deposited into
        tissue. Figures 13and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14show</TIMEX> changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> that
        closely resemble the changes in the electrical conductivity
        and current density. These figures indicate that
        temperature-dependent phenomena dominate the changes that
        occur in modeling results using electromagnetic heat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
        Figure 15presents a comparison of the heat flux for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> when a source voltage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.0</NUMEX> volts is applied.
        In each case, the heat flux is greatest at the proximal
        edge and the distal tip of the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The data
        show that accounting for perfusion decreases the heat flux
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>. Accounting for temperature-dependent electrical
        conductivity increases the heat flux by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 11%</NUMEX>.
        This demonstrates that temperature-dependent phenomena
        dominate the changes that occur in the heat sink (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>).
        Figure 17shows a comparison of the temperature
        distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">computed</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> models using a source
        voltage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.0</NUMEX> volts. This figure clearly indicates that
        the resulting temperature is dominated by tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>.
        At temperatures near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX>, we see differences of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that include and exclude
        tissue perfusion. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18shows</NUMEX> the maximum temperatures
        achieved using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as a function of source
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voltage</ENAMEX>. By increasing the source voltage to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.5</NUMEX> volts in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>, we were able to achieve
        temperatures near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX>. Tables 3and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5show</TIMEX> that the
        resulting temperature differences near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 8%</NUMEX>. These data suggest that the amount of
        error incurred by neglecting temperature-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX> is not related to the level of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>,
        but is more closely related to temperature. Figure 19shows
        that in the absence of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>, the highest
        temperatures are achieved in the center of the ablation
        probe. When tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX> is accounted for, the highest
        temperatures occur at the proximal edge and the distal tip.
        Thus, the distribution of temperature is more strongly
        related to the presence of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfusion</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusions
        
          Model Limitations
          There are several important differences between the
          temperature dependent properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NaCl solutions</ENAMEX> and
          those of tissue. First, temperature elevation of tissue
          results in the denaturing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which changes the
          electrical conductivity of tissue in a highly nonlinear
          fashion. While the exact effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein denaturing</ENAMEX> is
          not well understood, it is evident that the resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivity</ENAMEX> does not change linearly with temperature,
          as in sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride solutions</ENAMEX>. Preliminary data suggest
          that the electrical conductivity of tissues change
          substantially once tissue is damaged. This phenomena has
          been well established 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 25</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the
          effects of temperature-dependent changes are likely to be
          understated.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> limitation in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is that it does not
          account for changes in tissue conductivity by assessing
          tissue damage. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have suggested that
          tissue follows an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrhenius</ENAMEX> function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . As such,
          tissue damage is a function of temperature and time. A
          subtlety in modeling ablation problems is that plots of
          temperature distribution do not necessarily equate to
          plots of resulting lesion size. This is especially true
          if ablations are performed for relatively finite periods
          of time. In our study, we have restricted our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to
          examining the steady-state changes in the various thermal
          and electromagnetic parameters. By doing so, tissue
          reaching a threshold temperature is assumed to be
          uniformly damaged. Therefore, for purposes of this study,
          temperature distribution and lesion size are equivalent
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrhenius</ENAMEX> phenomena are non-existent.
