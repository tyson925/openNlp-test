        The expression "physiologically based pharmacokinetic
        model" (PBPK) describes an approach where the drug kinetics
        are modeled using a realistic physiological description of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. This has now become a standard approach to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> and has been applied to many different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Despite this, most human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> studies
        still rely on approximate compartmental pharmacokinetic
        techniques and do not attempt a complete physiological
        model. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for this is that detailed kinetic
        information for the different organs is not available in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to the same extent as it is in animal studies. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are still somewhat
        difficult to use and remain a tool primarily of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>.
        This paper, along with the accompanying papers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ]
        , describes a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> modeling program (PKQuest) that is
        designed to overcome both of these problems. The first
        problem (lack of information) is avoided by preprogramming
        a large set of data about kinetics in different organs that
        can be called as default variables applicable to whatever
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solute</ENAMEX> is being investigated. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem (ease of
        use) is overcome by using a simple interface and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphical</ENAMEX> and printed output that provides a complete
        description of the pharmacokinetics. Despite this ease of
        use, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> provides a rigorously accurate PBPK applicable
        to all the different physiological and biochemical
        properties of the different compounds that are commonly
        investigated.
        This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> introduces the general features of the
        program, describes the mathematical details and explains
        the simple interface that has been designed to use it.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has incorporated a large number of features, some
        of which have been developed and introduced for the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> (see below). Some of these features are illustrated in
        this paper by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to obtain new information about
        the human pharmacokinetics of propranolol. This is an
        intensively investigated area. For example, a search in
        PubMed for the terms "propranolol" AND "pharmacokinetics"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">yielded 1306</ENAMEX> references. Despite this, there are still
        several important questions remaining about its behavior in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. In particular, the rather peculiar effect of food
        intake on plasma levels remains unexplained [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meals</ENAMEX>
        decrease the plasma levels when propranolol is given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenously</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>), and increase the plasma levels when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propranolol</ENAMEX> is given orally (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>). Since it has been shown
        that gastrointestinal absorption is complete [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , this
        meal effect must result from a food induced change in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, distribution or rate of absorption. Since liver
        propranolol metabolism is partially limited by liver blood
        flow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , the meal induced decrease in the plasma level
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> administered propranolol can be explained by the
        increase in liver blood flow that has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a meal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . However, this would
        not explain the meal induced increase in plasma levels
        following the oral propranolol. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will be used to try
        and provide an explanation of this behavior. This analysis
        is based primarily on the experimental data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>.
        al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] in which the plasma propranolol levels were
        measured after simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>,
        eliminating the effects of individual variation from these
        measurements. Requiring a single set of parameters to fit
        both the simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> plasma concentration data
        imposes a strong limitation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Comparing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameter set for the fed and fasted case then
        provides quantitative information about the effect of meals
        on propranolol pharmacokinetics. This analysis makes
        extensive use of the novel PKQuest feature that uses the
        blood levels following an oral dose to calculate the time
        course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intestinal PO absorption</ENAMEX>.
        In the last section, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will be used to quantitate
        the time course of intestinal absorption of a sustained
        release form of propranolol.
        The modeling program, along with the detailed
        applications described in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, is freely available
        on the Web at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pkquest</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Flow diagram
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> uses the conventional PBPK flow diagram [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          shown in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box corresponds</ENAMEX> to a well-mixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX> and each arrow is an input or output to the
          compartment determined by the blood flow. The different
          compartments are numbered from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (vein) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX> (lipid).
          Each compartment is described by the total organ blood
          flow (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>) and the total weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kg</ENAMEX>). In PKQuest
          the names shown in fig. 1can be used in place of the
          numbers. For example the muscle blood flow can be
          described either by F [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> [muscle]. Table Ilists
          the values of organ weight and the blood flow per organ
          weight for each organ for the standard human (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Kg</NUMEX>).
          These organ weights are for the default value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> body
          fat. They are scaled depending on the value of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fat</ENAMEX>" that
          is input. The "portal" compartment corresponds to all the
          organs drained by the portal vein (stomach, small and
          large intestine, pancreas and spleen) with a blood flow
          equal to that in the portal vein. The "liver" blood flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. The compartment
          labeled "other" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> all the other organs with a flow
          and weight adjusted to account for the total body weight
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Kg</NUMEX>) and the total default cardiac output (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.06</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>). For a complete listing of all parameters and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constants</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, download the file gensolve.mws
          from the PKQuest web site <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pkquest</ENAMEX>.comand view the
          routines "standardman()" and "defaultpar()".
          A number of other properties are associated with each
          compartment such as the water volume fraction of the
          tissue (wfract, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/Kg</ENAMEX>), the fraction of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compartment water</ENAMEX> that is extracelluar (ecf), the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">capillary</ENAMEX> clearance (flcear), etc. The critical variable
          describing the kinetics is the free water concentration
          c[i] for each compartment i. This is the concentration
          that determines the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> across the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capillary</ENAMEX>. It is related to the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">concentration C</ENAMEX>[i] (amount/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kg</ENAMEX>) by the parameter fw[i]
          which is the fraction of the total solute in compartment
          i that is free in the water phase (c = fw*C/wfract). The
          parameter fw is determined by factors such as protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solubility</ENAMEX>. Although fw is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> used in the actual calculations, its value is
          usually input in terms of other parameters, such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lipid/</ENAMEX>water partition coefficient [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] or the protein
          binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . For the propranolol calculations, fw[i]
          is related to the input parameters ktiss[i] (the ratio of
          tissue to plasma concentration) and freepl (the fraction
          free in plasma) by the relation: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fw</ENAMEX>[i] =
          freepl*watfr[i]/(watfrpl*ktiss[i]) where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watfr</ENAMEX>[i] and
          watfrpl are the water fractions in tissue i and in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX>.
          Each compartment can have a metabolic component (Q)
          described either by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaelis-Menten</ENAMEX> parameters Vm
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> (Q[i] = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm</ENAMEX>[i]*c[i]/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX>[i]+c[i])) if the metabolism
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturates</ENAMEX> or by a metabolic clearance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX>) if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> is linear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX> is a special case,
          removing solute either via filtered renal clearance
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">rclr</NUMEX>) or by tubule secretion (described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm</ENAMEX>[kidney],
          Km[kidney] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX>[kidney]). (The default is no tubule
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> or clearance). Each compartment can also have
          its own unique input from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (cinput[i]).
          The standard inputs are to the vein, lung or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> tract. It
          is assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption goes directly into the
          liver via the portal vein. This choice was made (as
          opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input into the portal compartment) because
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">solute</ENAMEX> absorbed by, e.g., the small intestine is
          picked up by the villous capillaries and removed in the
          portal vein before it distributes in the entire small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intestine</ENAMEX> or even in the local intestinal submucosal
          tissue compartment.
          It is assumed that the tissue region of each organ can
          be modeled as a single well-stirred compartment. This is
          clearly an approximation and effects such as diffusion
          gradients, countercurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and heterogeneous
          organ blood flows [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] will produce small
          deviations from this assumption. The exchange between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> and tissue compartments results from diffusion
          of the free solute between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and this well mixed
          tissue region during the passage through the capillary
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix</ENAMEX>, fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The rate of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is
          determined by the capillary permeability-surface area
          product (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>), which can be related to the parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fclear</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix</ENAMEX>, eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), which varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">impermeable</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> (flow limited). For flow limited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solutes</ENAMEX> (e.g. propranolol), the free water concentration
          (c) in the vein leaving the tissue is equal to the free
          tissue water concentration.
          The major limitation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is the
          representation of the venous and arterial vascular spaces
          as single compartments. This means that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> cannot
          provide an accurate picture of the very early time course
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> distribution (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than</NUMEX> a minute) when a more
          detailed model of the vascular compartments is required [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Determination of physiological parameters
          The most important feature of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> is the accuracy
          and validity of the physiological parameters (organ
          weight, blood flow, volume of distribution, etc.). The
          major advantage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> over a simpler <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">compartment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is that, presumably, it returns a
          higher resolution view of the way the body handles the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. This presumption depends on the assumption that the
          physiological parameters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are correct. A
          large amount of effort has been expended on the choice of
          these parameters in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. Initially, the parameters
          were chosen using standard references, such as the
          "Report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Group</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reference Man</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reference</ENAMEX> values for resting blood flow to organs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and by copying values used from previous PBPK
          models [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 17</ENAMEX> ] . Then the parameters were adjusted to
          insure that they were in agreement with such features as
          total blood volume and cardiac output [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] ,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extracellular</ENAMEX> space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and total body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ]
          . Finally, certain parameters were adjusted to optimize
          the fit to the pharmacokinetics of selected solutes. For
          example, muscle blood flow was adjusted to fit the D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O kinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , fat blood flow to
          fit the enflurane kinetics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extracellular</ENAMEX> space to fit the inulin kinetics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          All of the human physiological parameters are listed in
          the "standardhuman" procedure in the PKQuest program.
          Since muscle represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> of the total water
          volume, the muscle blood flow and volume are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most
          important parameters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. The value of the muscle
          blood flow would be expected to have large variations
          depending on whether, for example, the subject is lying
          on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> catheter in his arm or is
          ambulatory after an oral drug dose. It is a gross
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> to treat all the muscles as a single
          compartment with a single blood flow and some PBPKs have
          divided the muscle into a "working" and "resting"
          compartment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-division</ENAMEX> of the muscle
          compartment increases the complexity of the model beyond
          what is usually justified by the available data. For this
          reason, the muscle blood flow is the parameter that is
          most frequently varied for the different studies
          described in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and will be regarded as an
          adjustable parameter. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, when the blood flow of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> organ is changed, all the other organ flows remain
          the same, so that the total cardiac output is also
          changed. The default value for the muscle blood flow is
          at the low end of most estimates (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0266</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liters</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kg</ENAMEX>),
          representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> of the cardiac output. In several of the
          studies described in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, the muscle blood flow
          has been increased by up to a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
          The focus in this series of papers is on human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> (using the "standardhuman" parameter
          set). In addition, a "standardrat" parameter set is
          included in the current version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The
          physiological parameters for this rat data set have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen</ENAMEX> and refined using the same approach that was
          described here for the human data set.
        
        
          Implementation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is written using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> (version <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8</NUMEX>)
          computer algebra system <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maplesoft</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. This means
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> must have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> installed and running
          before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> can be used. This limitation is outweighed
          by the advantage of being able to use all of the features
          that are preprogrammed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>, such as the numerical
          solution and graphical options. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> is available for
          most operating systems (PC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX>) and PKQuest
          should run on any system that has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> installed.
          The derivations and mathematic details of the modeling
          program are described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is so
          large and has so many optional features that not all of
          them can be described here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> focuses on the
          features of the program that are new and have not
          previously been incorporated into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, including
          the features <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> listed below. The
          description of many other features is available using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> "help" option that has been programmed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. This allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to enter the name of a term
          or parameter that is used in the program and view a
          description of the feature and how it should be used. As
          a typical example, entering the term fclear in the help
          option pops up a help page that begins:

          to describe the different options for entering values of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fclear</ENAMEX>[i] and for varying and optimizing this parameter.
          Almost every parameter in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has a similar help
          entry.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is a large program, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX>
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> procedures and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>
          worksheets. Once the program has been installed, the user
          only needs to deal with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simple procedures, each of
          which is contained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> worksheet: The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> procedure
          lists the values of the model parameters that differ from
          the default values for the specific solute that is being
          investigated. This procedure is labeled with a name that
          describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> being investigated. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          procedure calls the data in the first procedure, runs the
          program and determines the type of output that is
          displayed. In the remainder of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, the use of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> procedures will be illustrated by an
          investigation of the human propranolol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Experimental data
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> sets of experimental data were used. The first
          set was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagan et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . It
          described measurements of the plasma propranolol
          concentration <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 1 minute to 8 hours</TIMEX> after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kg</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">males</ENAMEX> (weight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set was the data of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] for the simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> infusion of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Kg</ENAMEX> (infused at a rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/min</ENAMEX>) of unlabeled
          racemic propranolol and oral dose of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 mg</NUMEX> (consisting of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 mg</TIMEX> of the hexadeuterium-labeled (+)-propranolol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrochloride</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg of the dideuterium-labeled (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>)
          propranolol hydrochloride). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> healthy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 to 100 Kg</NUMEX>. The doses were given either
          to fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> or immediately after eating a high
          protein breakfast. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> set was the experimental
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takahashi et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] of the plasma
          propranolol concentration after oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          mg of either conventional or long acting propranolol
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inderal LA</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>,
          average weight of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">59.1 Kg</NUMEX>).
          The mean plasma concentrations at each time point were
          used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> fitting. The experimental data points
          were obtained by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN-SCAN</ENAMEX>-IT (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Scientific</ENAMEX>

        Results
        
          Summary of features
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has a number of novel features, many of which
          have never before been implemented in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) There is a large set of default parameters (e.g.
          organ volumes, blood flows, volume of distribution) that
          can be called upon. For example, all the values required
          for human studies are setup simply by a call to
          "standardhuman". (The current version also implements a
          "standardrat"). The default case assumes that the solute
          is lipid soluble, distributes in all the body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, has
          a very high capillary permeability (is flow limited) and
          is not volatile (no pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>). Each of these
          assumptions can be easily modified. For example, if the
          drug distributes only in the extracellular space, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> need set only the parameter "mecf" equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will now use the default set of extracellular
          volumes for each organ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Or, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is not
          flow limited but has a significant capillary permeability
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs only to input a clearance
          value for the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capillaries</ENAMEX> ("fclear [muscle]") and
          all the other organs will have their permeability set on
          the basis of their blood flows and reference permeability
          surface (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>) product values relative to muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . As
          a another example, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is volatile so that
          pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is important, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> need only input
          values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>/air partition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kfwat</ENAMEX> (fat/water partition) and all the
          appropriate parameters necessary for a respiratory
          compound are activated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Any or all of the default
          values can be easily set to arbitrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> prescribed,
          values.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The output is routinely displayed in graphical form
          (in addition to the standard numerical output). No user
          input is required to specify the routine graphical
          output. All of the figures shown in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are taken
          directly from the output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> without any
          modifications. Experimental data can be either typed in
          or read from a tabular file.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) A chosen set of parameters can be optimized to give
          the best fit to the experimental data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> uses a
          rigorous non-linear global (simulated anealling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ]
          ) and local (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ) minimization routines that
          have a simple interface. For example, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> wanted
          to find the best set of values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Vmax and Km</ENAMEX> for
          the liver metabolism, and for the muscle blood flow
          ("F"), it is only necessary to input "adjustn" = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; and
          "adjustvar" = ["<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vm</ENAMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]","<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]","F[muscle]"]. Any
          of the parameters used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be optimized
          using this type of call and there is no limit to the
          number that can be simultaneously optimized (although, in
          most cases, simultaneous optimization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX>
          parameters is not recommended, given the limited
          experimental data).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The rate of intestinal absorption (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>, defined as
          the rate of uptake by the portal vein) of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> can be
          determined from the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">venous blood</ENAMEX> levels
          after an oral dose. A new technique is used to invert the
          model equations in order to obtain an accurate solution
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption. This is a useful new application
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>, providing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> with an accurate time course
          (and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">graphical</ENAMEX> output) of the oral absorption rate (or,
          optionally, intramuscular, intraperotineal, or skin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorption</ENAMEX>) for any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> whose PBPK parameters have been
          previously determined. This is probably the single most
          important original feature in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, opening up a new
          approach to a number of pharmacokinetic problems. An
          example of the potential of this tool is illustrated in
          the application to propranolol discussed below.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass liver metabolism (FPM) and systemic
          (peripheral) availability of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PO administered drug</ENAMEX> is
          directly determined and plotted as output. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemic</ENAMEX>
          availability is defined as the equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input that
          would produce an identical venous concentration as a
          function of time as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input). This determination
          uses a new definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> that is applicable to the
          case of non-linear (saturable) liver metabolism. As has
          been discussed previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , the classical
          definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> breaks down for the non-linear case and
          this is the first rigorous approach to describing this
          case. This aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is presented in more detail
          in an accompanying paper that focuses on ethanol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plasma</ENAMEX> and extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding is treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigorously</ENAMEX>. Since the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have some protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, an accurate modeling of this property is
          essential. The option of non-linear (saturable) protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> is also included. Because this saturation greatly
          complicates the mathematics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, it is rarely
          included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPKs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also allows for a combination
          of capillary permeability limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and non-linear
          binding - the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time this case has been described and
          implemented. These features are described in more detail
          in an accompanying paper that discusses the application
          to antibiotics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) Although it is well recognized that capillary
          permeability may limit the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, most PBPK <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> deal only with the high capillary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> (flow limited) case. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> provides for a
          rigorous modeling of capillary permeability limitations.
          It is shown in an accompanying paper [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] that solutes
          that are normally assumed to be flow limited can have a
          significant capillary permeability limitation if there is
          a high degree of plasma protein binding.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) The model of the lung used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">respiratory gases</ENAMEX> allows for the option of
          ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> can be divided
          into an arbitrary number of compartments (determined by
          the parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1dim</ENAMEX>) with a log normal distribution of
          flows and ventilation to each compartment determined by
          the either the default or user input values of the log
          standard deviation of ventilation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sig_v</ENAMEX>) and perfusion
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sig_f</ENAMEX>). This feature is described in more detail in an
          accompanying paper that analyses the pharmacokinetics of
          volatile solutes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> can be used to describe an arbitrary number
          of simultaneously interacting solutes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> (competitive or non-competitive inhibition)
          are allowed. Also, the case where some solutes are
          converted into other solutes can be modeled, with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">separate Vm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX>/product pair.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> parameters for propranolol intravenous (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>)
          input
          Some of these features will be illustrated by
          application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to propranolol pharmacokinetics. A
          baseline set of physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters will be
          determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagen et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          This data was chosen because it represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
          most complete sets of propranolol data, with plasma
          values ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes to 8 hours</TIMEX>. Shown below is
          the listing for the procedure "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">prop_iv_fagen"</ENAMEX>, which
          inputs all of the unique parameters that are required.
          These values have been adjusted to provide a good fit to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagen et</ENAMEX>. al. data.

          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line in the procedure ("defaultpar()") calls
          another procedure that sets up all the default
          parameters. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> line (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wtot</ENAMEX>) is the total body
          weight. It is the only parameter that must be set before
          the call to "standardhuman". (The weight is arbitrary for
          this data because the dose was scaled for body weight.
          The value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX> was chosen because it is the average
          value for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. data, see below). The forth
          line is the fraction of body weight that is fat. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> line ("cunit") sets the amount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that is used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrograms</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of volume, weight and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> are always liters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Thus, for this
          case, the concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are micrograms/liter. The
          parameter cunit is not needed for the actual
          calculations, but is used to label the printed output
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and the axis of the output plot. Line 6 ("concunit")
          determines the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are used for the experimental
          input value. In this case, concunit[vein] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> indicates
          that the experimental input data corresponds to the
          venous plasma concentration. Line 7 ("rblpl") is the
          blood/plasma concentration ratio. If this is not entered
          then a default value will be used. However, in this case
          the experimental value is known [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          The next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> lines (lines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8-14</NUMEX>) are related to the lipid
          binding of propranolol. Propranolol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> has been studied in great detail [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 30 31 32</ENAMEX> ] .
          The propranolol tissue distribution seems to be
          determined primarily by the phosphatidylserine
          composition of the tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . These studies indicate
          that the factional binding is constant, and does not
          saturate over the pharmacological concentration range.
          Since drug binding is such a ubiquitous property of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has incorporated a large number
          of different ways that the data can be entered. In this
          case, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sets of data are required: freepl, which is the
          fraction free in plasma and is set in line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> to the
          experimental value [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and ktiss[i], the ratio of the
          equilibrium tissue/plasma concentration which is set in
          lines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-14</NUMEX>. Lines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-11</NUMEX> set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ktiss</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.67</NUMEX> for all the
          organs, and lines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-14</NUMEX> reset the ktiss for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> organs that
          are known to have distinct binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, muscle and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipid</ENAMEX>). Tissue binding studies indicate that propranolol
          binding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> times higher, and muscle
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of that of most tissues. Somewhat
          surprisingly, propranolol binding to fat tissue is less
          than the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> as indicated by a smaller
          volume of distribution (when normalized for body weight)
          in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Although these values of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ktiss</ENAMEX>[i] are similar to the experimental measurements in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , they have been slightly adjusted to
          improve the fit.
          It is well established that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is the major
          site of propranolol clearance. Line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]) is
          the input data describing the liver metabolism. Although
          it has been shown that the liver metabolism is
          non-linear, saturating at high blood levels, this
          non-linearity only becomes significant at doses above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          mg/day [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . At lower doses, both the liver metabolism
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PO absorption</ENAMEX> appear to be linear [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . All the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that will be used here fall in this linear dose
          range. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> options for entering the
          metabolism of each organ i. If metabolism is non-linear,
          than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vmax</ENAMEX>[i] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Km</ENAMEX>[i] are required and
          the rate of metabolism of organ i is described by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vmax</ENAMEX>[i]*c[i]/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX>[i] + c[i]) where c[i] is the free
          concentration in the water of organ i. If the metabolism
          is linear, than metabolism is described by the parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX>[i] (rate of metabolism = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX>[i]*c[i]). Since the
          propranolol liver metabolism is linear, it is described
          by inputting a value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liters</ENAMEX>/min.
          This value was determined by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powel</ENAMEX> minimization
          feature in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to optimize the fit to the
          experimental data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> is the "intrinsic" clearance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, relating the rate of
          metabolism to the free water liver concentration. This
          intrinsic clearance differs significantly from the actual
          liver clearance (volume of plasma cleared in one pass
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>) because the liver clearance is
          partially flow limited and the free water concentration
          is lower than the absolute concentration. Although there
          is some stereoselectivity in the propranolol metabolism,
          the effect is small and was neglected in this analysis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] .
          Line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ("datafile") is the name of the computer
          tabular file where the data (time, concentration) is
          stored. In line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>, "pdata" is the number of input files,
          and the data is read into data [i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>].
          The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> lines specify the experimental input
          functions. The parameter "ninput" is the number of input
          functions. In this case there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> - described by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> table "finput [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ". The table parameter
          "organ" is the compartment that the input entered - in
          this case (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input) the venous compartment. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> "type" specifies the mathematical form of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">input</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bolus</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = constant infusion, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exponential</ENAMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> type). In this case there was a constant
          infusion at a rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> micrograms/min starting at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tbeg</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and ending at tend = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. (See below for
          an example of multiple inputs.)
          This completes the description of the data entry for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propranolol</ENAMEX>. There are really only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sets of values that
          are specific for propranolol: the lipid binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (freepl and ktiss[i]) and the liver clearance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]). All the rest of the entries (body weight,
          concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, data file, etc.) are essentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">housekeeping</ENAMEX>. The default parameters (set up by the call
          to "defaultpar") are for the case that the solute is flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> and distributes in all the body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Since this
          is the case for propranolol, the parameters describing
          the volume of distribution and capillary permeability do
          not need to be input.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for this set of model
          parameters
          Using this propranolol data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is ready to be
          run. A listing of the procedure "pkquest" is shown
          below:
          pkquest:= <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proc</ENAMEX>()
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prop_iv_fagen</ENAMEX>();
          modelplot:=table([n =

          cdata:=vein;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calculate</ENAMEX>(adjustn,adjustvar,farea,findabs);
          end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">proc</TIMEX>;
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line of the procedure calls the data listed
          above in the procedure "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">prop_iv_fagen"</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> line
          calls for the standard graphical output. In this case,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will output the plot of just the venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, (ip<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>)=vein) starting at the time
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experimental data point (data[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>][<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>][<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]) and
          ending at the time of the last data point (data[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]
          [nops(data[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>])][<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]). (Up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> different organ
          concentrations can be plotted on the same graph). The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> line ("cdata") specifies that the venous
          concentration at the experimental data time points will
          be printed in addition to the graphical output. The last
          line (calculate) runs the program.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">graphical</ENAMEX> output is shown in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. (The
          entire run took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than one second</TIMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ghz</ENAMEX> PC). The
          solid line is the model plasma concentration and the open
          squares are the experimental data. The complete layout of
          this figure (axes, labels, etc.) is determined without
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> has a variety of export options.
          The figures shown here have been exported in jpg
          format.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also prints out information pertinent to each
          particular case, such as, in this case, the rate of liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, portal and hepatic blood flow, plasma and
          tissue binding, etc. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also routinely outputs the
          classical pharmacokinetic values for the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classical Phamacokinetics</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experimental Data</ENAMEX>
          (extrapolate to infinity): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3003.4840</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUMC</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">557363.9367</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>(min) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.05</NUMEX> clearance(lit) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3651</NUMEX>

          where the total clearance and steady state volume are
          determined from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUMC</ENAMEX> (the area under the
          curve and its first moment), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> (the mean input
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          input data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] simultaneously administered
          unlabeled propranolol intravenously (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>), and deuterium
          labeled propranolol orally (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>) and measured the plasma
          levels of the labeled and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unlabeled drug</ENAMEX>. Since the
          propranolol pharmacokinetics are linear for this dose,
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inputs can be treated as completely independent
          and non-interacting. These experiments will be used to
          quantitate the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> on propranolol plasma
          levels.
          The approach that will be used is based on finding a
          set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters that are consistent with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simultaneous PO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> parameters
          must meet the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> criteria: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Since the
          measurements are simultaneous, an identical set of
          parameters must be used in the modeling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and
          oral input data. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> plasma levels for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          input must fit the observed plasma values. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The PKQuest
          total absorption for the oral input plasma data must be
          equal to the total experimental oral dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg. These
          are quite restrictive conditions. This process will be
          carried out for both the fasted (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and meal case
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) in order to determine the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> on
          the propranolol pharmacokinetics.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for the case where
          the propranolol was given to fasted subjects
          simultaneously by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (fig. 3A) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> (fig. 3B)
          route. Figure 3Ashows a comparison of the experimental
          plasma data and model predictions when the propranolol
          was given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kg</ENAMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Bshows</NUMEX> the PKQuest
          calculation of the time course of the intestinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> (open squares) determined using the
          experimental plasma values for the oral propranolol
          administration. Note that, as required, the predicted
          total absorption equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg, the experimental oral
          dose. The same set of parameters is used for both figs.
          3Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>. All of the parameters are identical to those
          used above (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagen et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] data
          except that it was necessary to reduce the portal blood
          flow by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> from the default value used in fig. 2in order
          to satisfy the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> criteria stated above. This strong
          dependence on portal flow arises from the fact that the
          liver clearance is limited by liver blood flow for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX>, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass clearance of an oral dose is
          relatively independent of liver flow. This relationship
          can be quantitated and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kornhauser et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] used
          measurements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral dose to
          estimate the total liver blood flow. In addition, the
          muscle blood flow was doubled for the fit in fig. 3in
          order to slightly improve the fit. It is not clear
          whether this change in muscle flow has some physiological
          significance or is basically a sort of "fudge
          factor".
          For the output shown in fig. 3B, the parameter
          "findabs" was set = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This tells <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to use the
          input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels to determine the intestinal absorption
          rate (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> for details). (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Setting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">findabs</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          will find the rate of input into the venous compartment,
          corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> or skin absorption). Figure
          3Bshows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard</TIMEX>, default <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output format for
          this option. The open squares are the total predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> as a function of time. The solid line is a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-parameter approximation to the actual model total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> (absorption at time t = A [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H+T H</ENAMEX>)]
          where A = total absorption, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H = Hill</ENAMEX> exponent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = half
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>). In most cases this provides a good approximation
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . However, in this case the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> is poor because of the unusual long initial
          delay in the propranolol absorption (see below for
          discussion). The open triangles are the total amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systemically</ENAMEX> (peripherally) available propranolol,
          determined by finding the equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input that would
          produce the same plasma levels (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix</ENAMEX>, section
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, for details). The difference between the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> (squares) and peripheral availability
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>) is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass liver metabolism. The time
          dependence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption has an initial delay of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 to 40 minutes</TIMEX>, followed by a relatively rapid rate of
          absorption that is nearly complete within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
          A test of the accuracy of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>
          absorption using plasma concentration data that mimics
          the experimental data for propranolol is described in the
          Appendix, section <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>. For this test case, the total
          predicted absorption differs from the actual total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>
          input by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX>.
          The next step is to repeat the above calculations, but
          this time using the simultaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral data when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propranolol</ENAMEX> is administered at the same time as a
          standard meal (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">660 calorie</NUMEX> high protein breakfast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          ). As before, since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of data are obtained
          simultaneously, exactly the same set of physiological
          parameters must be used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral calculations.
          Some of these parameters should differ from those used
          for the above calculations (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) because of the
          changes induced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. It is well established that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">portal</ENAMEX> blood flow is increased during a meal. Direct
          measurements in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> of the time course of portal blood
          flow after a meal show an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 50 and 100%</NUMEX>
          that peaks <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 to 60 minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olfanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] found an average meal induced
          increase in total liver blood flow of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 34%</NUMEX> using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indocyanine</ENAMEX> green [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . It has also been shown that the
          serum propranolol binding is not affected by meal induced
          variations in fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] so that the model
          parameters related to lipid binding (freepl and ktiss[i])
          were not allowed to vary between the fasting and standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> experiments.
          As described above, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> have a bi-directional effect
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels: decreasing the plasma concentration (and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>) when propranolol is given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>, and increasing the
          levels (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>) when given orally. This bi-directional
          meal effect could not be fit just by varying the portal
          blood flow. In order to quantitatively fit the meal data,
          it was necessary to increase the value used above for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> fasting portal blood flow (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">portal</ENAMEX>]) by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> and decrease the "intrinsic" liver propranolol
          clearance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]) by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>. The increased portal
          flow is consistent with the indocyanine green
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PKQuest</ENAMEX> fit to the meal data using this modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> set. As before, the requirements of a
          "successful" fit to the simultaneous data is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          input model curve fit the observed plasma concentration
          (fig. 4A) and the predicted total absorption for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>
          input case (fig. 4B) equal the actual amount administered
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 mg</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to a slow release form of
          propranolol
          In this section, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will be applied to the data
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takahashi et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] in which the oral absorption
          (in fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>) of a sustained release form of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propranolol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inderal LA</ENAMEX>) was compared with the standard
          form in same set of subjects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters used
          for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were identical to those determined
          above for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagen et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , except
          that the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>] was adjusted (increased by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> per Kg body weight) so that the total absorption for
          the standard propranolol equaled the total oral dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the predicted time course for the
          experimental data for oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the standard
          form (fig. 5A) and the long acting form (fig. 5B). It can
          be seen that the absorption rate is markedly slowed.
          There appears to be a significant absorption rate even
          for the last data point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24.5 hours</TIMEX>. It can also be
          seen that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 50%</NUMEX> of the slow release form is
          absorbed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mg absorption of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mg
          dose). It is possible that a higher absorption faction
          would have been seen if the plasma measurements were
          carried out for longer times. This result is consistent
          with the absorption estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takahashi et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] , based on measurements of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hour</TIMEX> urinary
          excretion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> metabolites of propranolol.
          Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters have been determined, PKQuest
          can be used to predict the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels for an arbitrary
          set of input functions. For example, using the above
          analysis, one can determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels after
          different dosage regimens of the standard and long acting
          forms of propranolol. This will be illustrated by a
          comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> mg
          of the standard form given in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> mg doses, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times a day
          (at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hour</TIMEX> intervals) versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> mg of the sustained
          release form (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inderal LA</ENAMEX>) given once a day. (According to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians Desk Reference</ENAMEX>, these are roughly
          equivalent therapeutic doses). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption rate
          (Q(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)) is described by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equations
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output shown in fig.
          5A(standard) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>(long acting) where Q(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) = A [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H/</ENAMEX>(t
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H+T H</ENAMEX>)] and A = total absorption, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H = Hill</ENAMEX> exponent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time. For the case of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times per day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> mg
          standard dose: A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40000</NUMEX> g, H = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.67</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122.1</NUMEX>
          (fig. 5A). For the case of the once per day <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 mg long</NUMEX>
          acting dose: A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g; H</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.25</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">499.2</NUMEX> (fig.
          5B). The value of A (total amount absorbed) for the long
          acting form was assumed to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mg, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mg</TIMEX> dose.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has a simple interface for entering arbitrary
          input doses. The following input is for the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>

          intervals:

          required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.7 seconds</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mhz</ENAMEX> computer). It can be seen
          that the once per day <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 mg</NUMEX> long acting dose has
          significantly lower blood levels then the same daily
          dosage of the standard form.
        
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusions
        
          Overview of novel aspects of PKQuest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PKQuest</ENAMEX> differs from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPKs</ENAMEX> in that it has been
          designed to be a complete general-purpose modeling
          program. To this end it includes all the different
          features that are required to model the commonly
          investigated compounds. In this and the accompanying
          papers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , examples of the application of PKQuest
          to the human kinetics for D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, inulin, propranolol, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>,
          toluene, anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>, ceftriaxone and dicloxacillin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein bound antibiotics</ENAMEX>) are presented. All of these
          studies use the same set of basic physiological
          parameters. (For most of these compounds, these results
          represent the first complete human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBPK</ENAMEX>.) These compounds
          cover most of the range of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> that one
          would expect to encounter in a pharmacokinetic study. The
          pharmacokinetics of different solutes depends on
          different sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters. For example, the time
          course of the distribution of D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] has a strong dependence on
          the cardiac output, muscle blood flow and total body
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, while the kinetics for inulin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] have a strong
          dependence on the extracellular volume and capillary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">permeability Knowing</ENAMEX> that the same PBPK (using the same
          set of parameters) is applicable to a large variety of
          compounds increases ones confidence in the validity of
          the parameters.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> illustrate other novel
          features of PKQuest: a) quantitation of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass
          metabolism for non-linear liver metabolism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ; b)
          measurement of capillary permeability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ; c)
          description of non-linear plasma and tissue protein
          binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) pharmacokinetics of volatile solutes [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] ; and e) importance of perfusion-ventilation mismatch
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> provides significant new
          information about intensively investigated solutes.
          The most important of the new features is the option
          that provides a quantitative measurement (and graphical
          output) of the time course of the intestinal absorption
          and peripheral (or systemic) availability. Calculations
          of intestinal absorption have been incorporated into
          earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> calculations based on the assumption that
          intestinal absorption could be described by either a
          simple <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order rate process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] , or by a
          pseudo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] multi-compartment process.
          These intestinal compartmental parameters were then
          adjusted to provide the optimal fit to the observed blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course. In contrast, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the PBPK equations
          are directly solved for the intestinal absorption time
          course without any assumptions about the physical or
          mathematical form of the absorption process.
          If the system is linear, another method of estimating
          the intestinal absorption or peripheral availability is
          by the application of the deconvolution approach to the
          blood levels after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input in the same subject
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . For the peripheral availability, this technique
          provides a direct approach with a minimum of model
          assumptions. In contrast, the intestinal absorption
          cannot be directly determined by the deconvolution
          approach without some additional assumptions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] or by
          using experimental measurements of the systemic blood
          levels produced by portal vein input [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . Thus,
          the intestinal absorption feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> should
          provide a useful new application even for the linear
          case.
          The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to determine the intestinal
          absorption or peripheral availability requires that PBPK
          parameters first be determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input
          measurements. However, this does not mean that these
          measurements must be made in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (as is
          a requirement for the strict deconvolution approach). For
          example, in the above measurement of the rate of
          intestinal absorption of the long acting form of
          propranolol, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input information was available for
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters for these subjects
          were determined by using the previously determined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, inputting the body weight and fat fraction
          for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and by using the assumption that the
          short acting form was completely absorbed to determine
          the value of the intrinsic liver clearance for these
          subjects.
          The term "intestinal absorption" used in PKQuest
          refers to the total amount that enters the portal vein.
          Drug that is absorbed and then metabolized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX>
          tract before entering the portal vein will be treated as
          if it was never absorbed. For the special case of a drug
          that is known to be completely absorbed (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. ethanol</ENAMEX>),
          the difference between the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> "absorption" and
          the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> dose is a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract drug
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> provides the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, rigorous, operational
          definition of peripheral availability and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (FPM) for the non-linear case. As discussed in
          detail in the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to ethanol
          metabolism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , confusion about the definition of FPM
          has been the cause of a controversy regarding the
          relative importance of gastric metabolism in the overall
          ethanol metabolism.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important applications of animal PBPKs
          is to predict the time course of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> levels in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. This feature must be used warily when applied to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> because the tissue partition coefficients are, in
          most cases, not directly measured but are extrapolated
          from animal measurements. The successful prediction of
          the venous plasma concentrations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. figs. 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>)
          does not guarantee that the correct tissue partition
          coefficients have been used, especially in organs with
          small volumes (e.g. brain) that have little influence on
          the total body disposition. The output of PKQuest allows
          the simultaneous display of the concentrations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 6</TIMEX>
          different organs.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> on propranolol
          pharmacokinetics
          The application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to the simultaneous
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] indicates that a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meal</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> actions on propranolol metabolism: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) An
          increase in portal blood flow; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) A decrease in the
          intrinsic liver metabolism of propranolol. This meal
          induced increase in portal blood flow is a well
          documented effect [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, the
          decrease in metabolism has not been previously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitated</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] suggested that the
          increase in portal blood flow might be the only change
          required to explain the meal effect. The decreased
          intrinsic clearance presumably results from some
          competition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> between the absorbed food
          products and propranolol.
          There is another rather peculiar effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> on
          propranolol kinetics that is not usually commented on. A
          close look and at the plasma blood level measurements of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melander et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walle et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] reveals
          that the peak in the plasma concentration curve for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meal</ENAMEX> case occurs at a slightly earlier time than for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasting</ENAMEX> case. This is the opposite of what would be
          expected because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> will significantly delay the
          rate of gastric emptying which should delay the peak in
          the plasma concentration. For example, the peak in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood ethanol</ENAMEX> after an oral dose is delayed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> by a meal because of the delayed gastric emptying
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 52</ENAMEX> ] . The above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> analysis provides an
          explanation for this peculiar effect. A comparison of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Band 4Bshows</ENAMEX> that in the fasting case (fig. 3B)
          there is a long delay (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 40 minutes</TIMEX>) before any
          significant PO absorption occurs. This initial delay is
          significantly reduced in the meal case (fig. 4B). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 40</TIMEX>
          minute initial delay suggests that some sort of change in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of propranolol (e.g. lipid binding or micelle
          formation) is required before it can be absorbed and that
          this change is more rapid in the presence of a meal.
          Whatever the explanation, this ability to obtain high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> information about the time course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> drug
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> is a useful feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>.
          In addition to providing quantitative information
          about the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PO drug absorption</ENAMEX> and peripheral
          availability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also routinely provides a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          parameter equation describing the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption
          that can be used to predict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels for other dosage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX>. This was illustrated above in a comparison of
          the same total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> propranolol dose given either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          times per day using standard propranolol or once per day
          as the long acting form. This same approach can be used
          to predict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels administered via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> or
          skin.

          The derivation of the basic set of model equations is
          described here. This derivation takes pains to
          distinguish clearly between weights and volumes of organs
          and flows and between the total organ concentration and
          the free water concentration. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, volume, weight

          It will be assumed in this section that solute binding
          is linear and does not saturate (fw 
          i = constant). The modifications of
          the equations required for non-linear binding will be
          described in section <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. The solution described in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> uses the conventional approach that is routinely
          used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> models. The only aspect that is novel is the
          incorporation of a capillary permeability limitation
          through the parameter fclear 
          i .
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7describes</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of solute between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and tissue compartment across the capillary wall.
          It is assumed that the tissue consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capillaries/Kg</ENAMEX>, all with exactly the same geometry, blood
          flow, permeability, etc. It will also be assumed that the
          relation between the capillary and tissue concentration
          is in a pseudo steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The steady state
          differential equation for the concentration in the
          capillary as a function of position is:
          
          where C and c are the total and free water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, subscript B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> refers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
          tissue compartment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is the capillary permeability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is
          the number of capillaries per Kg tissue, and a is the
          capillary radius. The total concentration C 
          B can be related to the free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (c 
          B ) using the definition of fw 
          b (C 
          B = c 
          B wfract 
          b /fw 
          b ). Integrating eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> over the length
          of the capillary and solving for the venous concentration
          leaving the capillary:
          
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> is the permeability-surface area product per
          tissue weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 2</ENAMEX> can then be
          related to capillary clearance term fclear[i] (for organ
          i) that is used in PKQuest:
          
          where the dimensionless fclear is equal to the
          fractional equilibration that occurs in one pass through
          the capillary. Note that physical capillary permeability
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>) in eq. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is multiplied by fw 
          b , the fraction free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, solutes that have a high intrinsic permeability may
          become permeability limited if a large fraction is bound.
          This case is discussed in detail in the application of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein bound antibiotics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          Using eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to relate the venous concentration (c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> ) to the tissue concentration (c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> ) and the definition of fw to relate
          the free to total concentration, the differential
          equation for the free tissue concentration in organ i (c 
          i ) can be obtained from the mass
          balance relation for organ i:
          
          where Q is the metabolic utilization and cinput is the
          input from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. In equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4</NUMEX>, c 
          B is the free concentration entering
          the organ. For the lung c 
          B corresponds to the venous
          concentration and for all other organs c 
          B is the arterial concentration. If
          the solute can only distribute in the extracellular
          space, than the wfract 
          i term in eq. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> is replaced by the
          product ecf 
          i  wfract 
          i where ecf 
          i is the fraction of extravascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in organ i that is extracellular.
          The mass balance equation for the lung must be
          modified to take account of ventilatory exchange of
          volatile solutes. The total concentration of solute in
          the lung (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) is the sum of the solute in the
          lung tissue compartment plus that in the alveolar gas
          space:
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)  
          C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> = 
          ValvC 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alv</ENAMEX> +

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> =

          c

          fw 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valv</ENAMEX> is the alveolar volume per unit weight
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/Kg</ENAMEX>) and C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is the absolute tissue concentration
          which can be related to the free concentration in lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) via fw 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> . It is assumed that the solute in
          alveolar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is in equilibrium with the lung tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>:
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)  
          C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Alv</ENAMEX> =

          Kwair 
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> is the water/air partition coefficient.
          Thus:
          
          Thus, eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> can also be used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fw</ENAMEX>'
          substituted for fw. The cinput term in eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> for the lung
          can be written in terms of the alveolar ventilation
          (alvent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liters</ENAMEX>/minute):
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>)  
          cinput 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> =

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwair</ENAMEX> )
          where C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhale</ENAMEX> is the inhaled gas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">moles/liter</ENAMEX>). The above equations are for
          the case where there is one lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">compartment</ENAMEX>. The
          modifications for the case of perfusion-ventilation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> is described in section <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 4</ENAMEX> is the mass balance for each organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>. We still need to define the mass balance for
          the arterial and venous compartments. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, the
          mass balance is described by:
          
          where the subscript A indicates <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, F

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> is the concentration in the venous
          blood leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. The concentration c L 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> can be related to the venous

          An equation similar to eq. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9</ENAMEX> is obtained for the
          venous compartment, except that it is necessary to sum
          over the venous concentrations leaving each organ,
          multiplied by the organ blood flow:
          
          where c i

          i /dt, i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0..11</NUMEX> for each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organs</ENAMEX> (i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2..11</NUMEX>) and the venous (i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>) and arterial (i
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 1</ENAMEX>) compartments is then solved by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Runge</ENAMEX>-Kutta
          numerical procedure for the values of c 
          i as a function of time. The free
          water concentration c 
          i is then converted to the
          experimental concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and plotted along with
          the experimental data. This conversion depends on exactly
          what is measured experimentally. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> the user
          inputs the parameter concunit[i] which characterizes what
          experimental unit is used. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concunit</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          indicates total concentration in units of amount/Kg wet
          weight; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concunit</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> corresponds to amount/liter tissue;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concunit</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> corresponds to plasma concentration,
          etc.
        
        
          II. Given the experimental venous concentration as
          a function of time, solve for rate of oral (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramuscular</ENAMEX> (IM) absorption as a function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>
          The solution described above in I corresponds to the
          case where the input to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the compartments
          is given (cinput[i]) and the concentration of the
          different compartments as a function of time is solved
          for. This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> describes the new procedure that was
          developed to invert this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>, and find the value of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cinput</ENAMEX>[i] as a function of time that would produce the
          experimental venous concentration. Although the approach
          described below can be used for input into any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, the current version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> implements
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> different inputs: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) PO input in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solute</ENAMEX> is absorbed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract and goes directly
          into the portal vein, where it distributes in and is
          metabolized by the liver before entering the systemic
          vein; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input in which the solute directly enters
          the systemic vein. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input case is applicable to any
          input where there is time dependent input directly to the
          venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> without significant distribution in another
          organ - e.g. intramuscular (IM), intraperitoneal (IP) or
          skin absorption.
          Since the venous concentration is known experimentally
          at a set of time points, this concentration can be used
          as input to the set of equations described in section I
          (omitting the venous differential equation, since its
          concentration is known). The solution to this set of
          equations then yields the corresponding arterial and
          organ concentrations as a function of time. In the
          implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic spline</NUMEX> interpolation
          is applied to the experimental data points to obtain a
          continuous function c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) that is used as input to the set
          of equations. For the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input these organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (as a function of time) should be equal to
          the actual organ concentrations in the experimental case,
          since both cases have the same venous concentration.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input case, all the organs will have the
          correct concentration except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> which receives
          input from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract in addition to the venous input.
          Another step is required to determine the liver
          concentration for this case. The differential equation
          for the venous compartment (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) can be solved for the
          liver concentration (c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liver</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)) since the concentrations in
          all the other organs and in the vein are known. (In eq.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, the cinput 
          v term is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> since there is no venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">input</ENAMEX>, and Q 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> because it is assumed for
          this case that there is no metabolism in the venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartment</ENAMEX>). The only factor in eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> that is not
          directly available is the time derivative of the venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (dc 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">v /dt</ENAMEX>). However, this can be estimated
          by taking the derivative of the cubic spline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpolation</ENAMEX> to the experimental venous data. This
          solution for the liver concentration is then combined
          with the previous solutions to obtain the concentrations
          of all the body organs as a function of time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>
          input case.
          Knowledge of the concentrations as a function of time
          of all the body compartments is all that is needed to
          determine the rate of input to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The total body
          input at time t is equal to the total amount in the body
          at time t (obtained by summing over all the body
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX>) plus the total amount that has been
          metabolized or excreted up to that time - which is
          obtained by integrating over the rates of metabolism (Q 
          i ) in the different organs, plus the
          rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal clearance</ENAMEX>, etc. In the implementation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, this calculated total amount input is plotted as
          a function of time. A test of this approach is described
          below (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) using data that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of what is
          observed experimentally for propranolol. It is shown that
          the total predicted absorption differs from the actual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">total PO</ENAMEX> input by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 0.5%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. Direct calculation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass
          metabolism or peripheral availability for the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX>
          input
          The procedure described above in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section II</ENAMEX> for
          determining the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption can be directly
          used to determine the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass metabolism. In the
          calculation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different sets of liver
          concentrations were obtained: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case 1</ENAMEX>) Using just the
          experimental venous concentration as input. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Case 2</ENAMEX>) Using
          the direct calculation of the liver concentration via the
          solution of eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>. Case <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> (and
          other organ) concentrations that would be obtained if the
          input were intravenous (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case 2</ENAMEX> is for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input.
          Both cases have exactly the same venous concentration.
          This means that both cases have the same "peripheral
          availability". Thus, the peripheral availability for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input case can be obtained by solving for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input
          as a function of time (by summing over the amounts in
          each organ plus the amount of metabolism) using the organ
          concentrations for Case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. This is a direct measure of
          what the time course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input would have to be to
          give exactly the same venous concentrations as occurred
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass metabolism (FPM) is
          directly related to the peripheral availability by the
          following relation:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pass Metabolism = Total Absorption - Peripheral</ENAMEX>
          Availability
          In the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption
          case, both the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption and the
          peripheral availability are routine plotted as a function
          of time.
          This is a new definition of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass metabolism. It
          provides the first rigorous, operational definition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> that is applicable to the non-linear liver metabolism
          case. This case is discussed in more detail in the paper
          describing the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to ethanol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. Modifications of above equations for the case
          where there is non-linear (saturable) protein
          binding
          Allowing for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">non-linear protein</ENAMEX> binding seriously
          complicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. It corresponds to the case where
          the fw 
          i in the above equations becomes a
          function of c 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) and it requires major
          modifications of all of the equations. The modifications
          described below are similar to those used previously by
          Tsuji, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] , but with the new feature of
          including the capillary permeability. This is the first
          description of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that allows for both
          non-linear binding and capillary permeability.
          The modifications of the left and right hand sides of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> will be described separately. The left hand side
          described the change in the total (bound + free)
          concentration in organ i:
          
          where, as previously defined, c 
          i is the free water concentration, and
          c b 
          i is the concentration of the bound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solute</ENAMEX> in the organ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. It will be assumed that there
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> homogeneous binding site with the classical
          Scatchard type binding described by:
          
          where k is the binding constant for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and Pb
          
          i is the concentration of protein
          binding sites in compartment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i. Pb</ENAMEX> must have the came
          units as c (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. moles/liters</ENAMEX>) and k has the inverse
          units (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">e.g. 1/</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">moles/liters</ENAMEX>)). It is assumed that there
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> type of binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (with a unique k)
          that is distributed with different concentrations (Pb 
          i ) in the different compartments.
          Taking the derivative of c b 
          i (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>) and substituting it in eq.
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15:</TIMEX>
          
          For the limiting case where binding does not saturate
          (kc 
          i << <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),  
          i in eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> becomes equal to 1/fw 
          i and eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> becomes equal to the left
          hand side of eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          The right hand side of eq. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> has a term that describes
          the balance between the inflow and outflow of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from
          organ i:
          
          where c 
          B and c i 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> are the free concentration in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood water</ENAMEX> entering and leaving organ i, and c b 
          B and c b 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> are the bound concentrations
          entering and leaving the organ. As before, c i 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> can be related to c 
          B and the tissue concentration c 
          i using fclear 
          i :
          
          Finally, substituting eq. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19</TIMEX> into eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>, and equating
          the right (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) and left hand sides (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>), the
          generalization of eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to include non-linear binding is
          obtained:
          
          where the new parameters  
          B ,  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and  are defined as follows: For
          the case where the binding is linear:
          
          For the case of non-linear binding (saturation)
          
          There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other complication introduced by the
          non-linear binding. As shown in eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the fclear 
          i that enters eqs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-22</NUMEX> depends on fw
          
          B which, for the non-linear case, is a
          function of c 
          B (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). To take this into account,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eq</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is solved for the value of fclear 
          i (c 
          B ):
          
          where fclear 
          i is the clearance in the limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          concentration and is the value the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> inputs to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. This last expression for fclear 
          i (c 
          B ) is substituted for fclear 
          i in eqs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-22</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Modification</ENAMEX> of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to include
          ventilation-perfusion mismatch
          The equation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section I</ENAMEX> for the lung assumed that
          there was one lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">compartment</ENAMEX>, perfused by F 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> (cardiac output) with an alveolar
          volume valv that was ventilated at a rate alvent. This is
          an idealized case and it is known that even in normal
          humans the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is heterogeneous, with different regions
          receiving different fractions of the cardiac output and
          the alveolar ventilation. In order to investigate the
          significance of the ventilation-perfusion mismatch, this
          feature was incorporated as in option in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. This is
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time this feature has been used in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>.
          As was discussed in detail by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
          the standard measurement of the distribution does not
          uniquely characterize the actual ventilation and
          perfusion heterogeneities to the different regions of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> and some additional assumptions must be made. The
          following derivation closely follows the arguments of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . It is assumed that the
          probability distribution of ventilation and perfusion can
          be described as a bivariate, uncorrelated, log-normal
          function:
          
          where  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> and  
          Q are the means and  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> and  
          Q are the standard deviations of the
          log normal distribution. The function F returns the
          fraction of the lung that has ventilation and blood flow
          in the interval 
          d ln and 
          d ln centered about ln and ln . The
          function can be normalized by the use of the normalized
          variables v and q:
          
          In the implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is divided
          into (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2N</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2equal</TIMEX> volume regions by finding the sequence
          of v 
          i and q 
          i (i = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0..N</TIMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) centered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0</NUMEX> such
          that all integrals of f(v)dv from v 
          i to v 
          i+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> have the same value. Then each of
          the regions r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ij</ENAMEX> (v 
          i ..v 
          i+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , q 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j ..q</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) has equal area. Each lung region
          r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ij</ENAMEX> is assigned a fraction of the total
          blood flow ( 
          
            ij 
           ) defined by:
          
          From the definition of q (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>):
          
          where, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> equality in eq. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>, the relation
          A21 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] has been substituted for
          exp( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">q</ENAMEX> ). Substituting eq. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27</TIMEX> into eq. 26
          and integrating, yields the blood flow to the ij region.
          A similar approach is used to find the ventilation to the
          ij region.
          The overall result of this rather messy procedure can
          be summarized as follows: The lung is divided into (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2N</NUMEX>)
          2equal volume regions, each region having a ventilation
          and blood flow based on the observed log normal
          distributions. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is defined to have the same
          tissue and alveolar volume. An important assumption that
          has been used here is that the ventilation and perfusion
          to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is uncorrelated. This assumption is
          consistent with recent direct measurements of regional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> and ventilation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] .
          In the implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the number of lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX>) is determined by the parameter N1dim
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 N1dim</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The default is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nlung</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          (indicated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N1dim</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>). Choosing N1dim = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, means that
          the perfusion and ventilation is distributed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> lung
          compartments which should be enough to provide a good
          test of the importance of perfusion-ventilation mismatch.
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nlung</ENAMEX>><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> then values are required for  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> (sig_v in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>) and  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sig_f</ENAMEX>). Default values of sig_v and
          sig_f are included in standardhuman. These default values
          were obtained using the relation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
          ] that relates the standard deviation of the distribution
          that is routinely measured ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">v/q</ENAMEX> ) to the values of  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> and  
          q that are required in eqs. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23-26:</TIMEX>
          
          where  is the correlation between perfusion and
          ventilation. The default values in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> are for the
          case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC"></ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> =  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> and  
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">v/q</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>, the normal value for young
          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can input arbitrary values by
          inputting sig_v and sig_f. This perfusion-ventilation
          mismatch feature is discussed and tested in the paper
          describing the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to volatile solutes
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Tests</ENAMEX> of the accuracy of the "find absorption"
          option of PKQuest
          The "find absorption" option (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> above for
          details) predicts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> absorption as a function of time
          based on the observation of plasma concentration at a set
          of time points. The following test of this calculation
          was carried out. It is assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> input is known
          and can be described by the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
          type equation similar to what was found experimentally
          for propranolol in fig:
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> Absorption</ENAMEX> at time t = A [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H+ T H</ENAMEX>)]
          where A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80000</NUMEX> micrograms, H = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8shows</NUMEX> the plasma concentration curve generated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> for this known input. The solid line is the
          model plasma concentration, and the squares are the
          values of the plasma concentration, sampled at the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points as the experimental plasma concentration in
          the measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanoff et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] described in
          the text. The test of the "find absorption" feature is to
          see if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> can reproduce the time dependent
          absorption that was used to generate these points (eq,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>), just using these experimental points as inputs.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9shows</NUMEX> the output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> using the "find
          absorption" option using the data points (squares) from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 8as input. The value of the total predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">absorption</ENAMEX> differs from the actual total input by only
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80505</NUMEX> versus actual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80000</NUMEX>). The time dependence of
          the absorption is also quite close to the actual input
          function (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>), with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> exponent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) differing
          by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.04</NUMEX> versus input <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)
          differing by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94.63</NUMEX> versus input <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90.0</NUMEX>). This agreement
          is remarkable, considering the coarse discrete samples of
          the venous concentration that were used as input to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>.
