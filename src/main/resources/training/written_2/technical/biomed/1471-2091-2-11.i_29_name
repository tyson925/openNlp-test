        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver exclusively synthesizes bile acids</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biosynthetic pathways. The "classical"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> begins with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7Î±</NUMEX>-hydroxylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
        operates entirely in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The "alternative"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> begins with the hydroxylation of the cholesterol
        side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. Although this reaction occurs in a wide variety
        of cells, the completion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid synthesis</ENAMEX> takes place
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX>. The classical pathway is responsible for
        the bulk of the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids synthesized</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ]
        .
        The major bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid species</ENAMEX> produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholic</ENAMEX> and chenodeoxycholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. These bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjugated</ENAMEX> to either taurine or glycine before secretion
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , which is subsequently released into the
        small intestine. Bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are reclaimed from the lumen of
        the intestine and returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> via portal blood
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reuse</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intestine</ENAMEX> is an efficient process that involves both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> transport along the entire axis of the intestine,
        and active transport in the terminal ileum [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The
        apical sodium/bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> co-transporter (asbt) mediates the
        active uptake of conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the ileum [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ]
        . In hepatocytes, both sodium-dependent and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sodium-independent</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> on the sinusoidal
        membranes extract bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from portal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Of these,
        the sodium/bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> co-transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypeptide</ENAMEX> (ntcp) is
        considered to be quantitatively the most important
        transporter of conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in these cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ]
        . The transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> from the basolateral to the
        canalicular membrane of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> is a poorly understood
        process. Intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid binding proteins</ENAMEX> have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated</ENAMEX> to participate in the transcellular transport as
        well as to buffer against the cytotoxic effects of bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent transporters on the canalicular
        membranes of hepatocytes mediate the secretion of bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> into bile [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recently, it was discovered that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are the
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> for a nuclear receptor termed farnesoid x
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FXR; NR1H4</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        may be important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of gene expression in the liver
        and intestines. To date, the genes that have been shown to
        be responsive to regulation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FXR</ENAMEX> encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved
        in the biosynthesis and transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> have been shown to modulate a variety of other
        cellular functions, such as secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] and translocation of bile acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX> to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, which are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver-</ENAMEX>derived cells engineered
        to transport bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> actively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ,
        taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> induce the formation of
        intracellular vesicles that resembles structures observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholestatic liver cells</ENAMEX> without apparent cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 18</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, glycine-conjugated
        bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> promote apoptosis in these cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
        different classes of conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> stimulate
        distinctive responses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>. Whereas
        taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are well tolerated,
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are extremely cytotoxic. Here
        we examined if this differential response is limited to
        cells that normally metabolize bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, and whether high
        level expression of an intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can attenuate the cytotoxic response of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX>
        cells to glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Differential cytotoxicity of glycine-conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
          We previously showed that taurine-conjugated bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, such as taurocholic (TCA) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taurochenodeoxycholic</ENAMEX> (TCDCA) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, were well tolerated
          by McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
          glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, such as glycocholic (GCA)
          and glycochenodeoxycholic (GCDCA) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, were cytotoxic
          to McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] concordant with what has been
          documented in hepatocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with the
          induction of apoptotic cell death; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX>, but not TCA,
          preferentially induced the activation of the initiator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 8</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). Indeed,
          glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> as a class of molecules
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced genomic DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> in this cell line at
          low concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>), while their taurine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> did not (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The cytotoxicity of
          glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> cannot be attributed simply
          to the preferential cellular accumulation of these bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells can accumulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCA</ENAMEX> and TCA
          to similar levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torchia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agellon</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations).
          There is considerable evidence to suggest that bile
          acids activate a variety of cellular signaling pathways
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCDCA</ENAMEX> is capable of activating
          PI3K activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells and, direct elevation of
          PI3K activity by transient expression of a plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI3K</ENAMEX> can protect McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells from
          GCDCA-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCDCA</ENAMEX>, also
          caused the elevation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>), suggesting that activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> may be a
          general response to taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
          Treatment of McNtpc<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LY294002</TIMEX>, a PI3K
          inhibitor, prior to the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> or TCDCA resulted
          in the loss of tolerance to these bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> as
          demonstrated by the activation of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          On the other hand, preincubation of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells with
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCA</ENAMEX> or TCDCA attenuated the GCDCA-mediated
          activation of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), suggesting that the
          activation of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PI3K</NUMEX>-dependent survival pathway is
          dominant over the death pathway. These results also
          indicate that the differential sensitivity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver-</ENAMEX>derived McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells to conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is
          due to the existence of a specific mechanism that is
          capable of recognizing different classes of conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In these cells, taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          specifically increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> activity which, in turn, leads
          to the activation of a survival pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> uptake activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
          cells
          To determine if non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> derived cells also posses
          differential sensitivity to bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-induced
          cytotoxicity, we engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> to take up bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> actively by expressing asbt. Colonies surviving the
          selection process were assayed for asbt activity and
          several clones showing a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> uptake
          activities were selected for further analysis. Analysis
          of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the selected clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asbt</ENAMEX>) readily
          showed the presence of the recombinant asbt mRNA (Figure
          3A). Correspondingly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt lysates, an
          immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of comparable size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~45 kDa</NUMEX>) to rat
          asbt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be easily detected using an anti-asbt
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was saturable with an apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> ranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 22</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼M</NUMEX> (Figure
          3C). The V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> values ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.323</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.769</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmol/mg protein/min</ENAMEX> and correlated with the abundance of
          the recombinant asbt mRNA encoded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. The
          uptake of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells
          reached steady state within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>), implying
          the presence of a pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid efflux</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
          cells. Furthermore, it was possible to chase the
          incorporated radiolabeled TCA from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3E</NUMEX>). These results demonstrate
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt cells express a fully functional asbt
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.

          cells
          The increase of LDH activity in the culture medium of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">asbt.35 and McNtcp.24</NUMEX> cells after treatment with
          glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were compared
          to assess the cytotoxic potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> on these
          cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cell line was chosen for this
          study because this cell line has bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> uptake
          activity that was comparable to McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          LDH activity in the culture medium of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
          increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 to 31%</NUMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 h</NUMEX> of incubating the cells
          in medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> of glycine conjugates of
          cholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chenodeoxycholic acid</ENAMEX>, and deoxycholic acid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDCA</ENAMEX>, respectively) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> was
          the most potent in inducing the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> among the
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> tested whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> had little effect as
          compared to the no addition controls. In contrast,
          incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells in medium containing 100
          Î¼M of taurine- or glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> resulted
          in a time dependent increase of LDH activity the culture
          medium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> were equally potent in
          increasing LDH activity, raising the level in the medium
          of treated cells by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Taurine</ENAMEX>-conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> also raised the LDH activity in the medium of
          treated cells to levels approaching GDCA-treated cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McArdle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RH-7777</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX>
          with taurine- or glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> had little
          effect on the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand 4D</ENAMEX>),
          indicating that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> uptake activity is necessary to
          manifest their cytotoxic potential in both cell lines. In
          addition, the cytotoxicity was specific to conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> since the addition of non-conjugated bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> to the culture medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX>-transporting
          cells had a negligible effect on the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> into
          the culture medium.
        
        
          Mechanism of cell death
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the caspase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of cysteine proteases
          have been implicated in the initiation and execution
          phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . In addition, several studies
          have shown the activation of the caspase cascade by toxic
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in hepatocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . We thus measured
          caspase activity after bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX>
          cells. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase 8</ENAMEX> was detected in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells after treatment with either taurine- or
          glycine- conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>), but absent in
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-treated CHO cells</ENAMEX> (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>). Analysis of
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated from treated cells showed that TCA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA laddering</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>), indicating that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> induce apoptosis in this non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepatic</ENAMEX> derived
          cell line. To further characterize the initiation of the
          caspase cascade, we determined the time course of caspase
          activation by bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> and McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX>
          cells. Activation of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in both cell lines was
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min following GCDCA-treatment and
          was maximal by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          TCA-mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase 8</ENAMEX> was first detected
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> and reached the levels induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>
          min.
          Because the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid transporters</ENAMEX> used to establish
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> uptake activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX>
          cells were not the same, it was possible that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitivity of CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells to taurine-conjugated
          bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> was a consequence of asbt expression. To
          address this possibility, asbt was expressed in McArdle
          RH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7777</NUMEX> cells and then tested for response to glycine-
          and taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7A</TIMEX>,
          asbt conferred active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> uptake activity in
          transfected cells. However, activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase 8</ENAMEX> was
          evident only in the cells that were treated with GCDCA
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>). These results demonstrate that the
          sensitivity of this cell line to taurine- and
          glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is not dependent on a
          specific kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transporter.
          Activation of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PI3K</NUMEX>-dependent pathway by
          taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> appears to decide the fate
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ). Therefore,
          we determined if PI3K activity was altered in bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-</ENAMEX>treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>,
          PI3K activity in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> or GCDCA was not evident
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells, suggesting that the inability to
          activate survival pathways by taurine-conjugated bile
          acids commit these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to apoptosis. These findings
          also indicate that liver derived cells posses a mechanism
          that responds to taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> leading to
          the activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Cytotoxic potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> in
          HBAB-expressing McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
          It has been suggested that sequestration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>
          by intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid binding proteins</ENAMEX> may also
          protect cells from bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>. Thus, the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid binder</ENAMEX> (HBAB) was expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX>.24
          cells to determine if this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can protect
          against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9Ashows</NUMEX> the presence
          of the recombinant mRNA encoding the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> in
          clones that have incorporated the HBAB expression vector
          into their genomes. In addition, the HBAB protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> in the total lysates correlated with the
          abundance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> mRNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9A</NUMEX>). Analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiolabeled TCA</ENAMEX> uptake (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9B</NUMEX>) showed that
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> had minimal impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> uptake
          despite the fact that the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HBAB protein</ENAMEX> abundance
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 5</NUMEX>-fold greater than that in the lowest HBAB
          expressing cell. Moreover, the rates of decline in the
          amount of radiolabeled TCA associated with the cells
          after withdrawal of the radiolabeled bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from the
          culture medium was comparable among the different clones
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9C</NUMEX>), indicating that the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> efflux
          from these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was also not affected by the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX>.
          Incubation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BN</ENAMEX> clones with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> increased the
          LDH activity in the culture medium to a level similar to
          that in the medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCDCA-</ENAMEX>treated McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10A</NUMEX>). In addition, caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activity in bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-</ENAMEX>treated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BN.25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BN.46 and BN.49</NUMEX> was comparable to
          that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX>, which were elevated compared to that
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McArdle</ENAMEX> RH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7777</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10B</NUMEX>). The time course of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> in BN cells after treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          Î¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> was similar to that observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNtcp</ENAMEX>.24
          cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10C</NUMEX>). Therefore, the presence of an
          intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid binding protein</ENAMEX> did not protect
          these cells from glycine-conjugated bile acid
          cytotoxicity, even at low bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> concentrations. These
          results indicate that the activation of a signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PI3K</ENAMEX> is the dominant mechanism
          responsible for protecting McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells from the
          cytotoxicity of glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we determined if the differential
        sensitivity elaborated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver-</ENAMEX>derived <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">McNtcp.24</NUMEX> cell
        line to different classes of conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is
        limited to cells that normally transport bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. We
        previously demonstrated that taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        are not toxic to McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> induce apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McNtcp</ENAMEX>.24
        cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, through activation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas</ENAMEX> receptor in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FasL</ENAMEX>-independent manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 25</NUMEX> ] .
        Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> was demonstrated to activate both initiator
        and effector caspases, and that the apoptotic response can
        be blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crm A</ENAMEX>, a caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The
        mechanism by which bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> stimulate the activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas</ENAMEX> receptor remains unclear. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fas</ENAMEX> deficient hepatocytes,
        toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> were still able to induce apoptosis,
        suggesting that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are capable of stimulating
        multiple pathways to initiate cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        To gain further insight into the specificity of bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>, we conferred active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> uptake
        capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX>, a cell type that does not normally
        metabolize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>, by expressing a bile acid
        transporter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt cells produce recombinant asbt with a
        molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> and kinetic parameters that are similar to
        previously reported values [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It is not known if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
        cells have pathways capable of facilitating the efflux of
        bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The apparent efflux observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> could be attributed to the fact that asbt is
        capable a bidirectional transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        However, it is conceivable that an efflux mechanism that
        recognizes bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> and other
        mammalian cells. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> express proteins
        capable of active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . As these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> do not normally synthesize bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, their
        ability to transport bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> may illustrate a
        generalized mechanism for cellular transport of hydrophobic
        organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anions</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells were used as a model to assess the
        cytotoxic potential of taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepatic</ENAMEX> derived and non-bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> metabolizing
        cells. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNtcp</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells, treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asbt</ENAMEX> clones
        with taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> resulted in cell death.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> was the most potent of taurine-conjugated bile acid
        tested. It is unlikely that the observed cytotoxicity of
        the conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> could be attributed to the
        generalized intracellular accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>
        because unconjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were transported by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt cells but did not cause significant release of LDH
        into the culture medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torchia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agellon</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        observations). In contrast, glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDCA</ENAMEX> in particular) were highly effective at causing the
        increase in LDH activity in the culture medium of both
        McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells. Primary hepatocytes
        exhibit differential sensitivity to taurine- and
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-transporting WIF-B cells, which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hepatoma</ENAMEX>-human
        fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , remain viable even when grown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX>-containing culture medium for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 14 days</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        In contrast, our study shows that taurine-conjugated bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> is toxic to a cell type that is not normally exposed
        to bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liver cells</ENAMEX>, which normally metabolize bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, apparently possess a mechanism that can distinguish
        and differentially elaborate distinct biological activities
        of taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        Both taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> induce
        apoptotic cell death in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells. The involvement
        of the caspase cascade in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells was illustrated
        by the fact that conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids activated caspase</ENAMEX> 8
        in a time dependent manner. However, the different profile
        of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation suggests that taurine- and
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> may trigger apoptosis by
        different pathways. At present, it is not known how
        conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids activate caspases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX>
        cells. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is immunoreactive to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiserum</ENAMEX> and has a molecular mass similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> Fas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is detectable in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CHO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell extracts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torchia</ENAMEX> and
        Agellon, unpublished results). This leaves the possibility
        that conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> may activate the apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in this cell line, as
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> do in hepatocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        However, the activation of caspases does not require a
        specific kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transporter since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> is not
        toxic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McArdle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RH-7777</ENAMEX> cells irrespective of whether
        these cells internalize bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> via ntcp or asbt.
        The differential response of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells to
        different classes of conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is apparently
        due to the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of either a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PI3K</NUMEX>-dependent
        survival pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] or caspase-dependent death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, neither taurine- nor
        glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids stimulated PI3K</ENAMEX> activity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> cells and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> were
        toxic. In addition, pre-treatment of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells with a
        PI3K <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> rendered these cells susceptible to TCA- and
        TCDCA- mediated cell death. The latter finding indicates
        that taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are capable of inducing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI3K</ENAMEX> is inhibited, probably by utilizing the
        same mechanism activated by glycine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> is able to activate PI3K in plasma membrane
        fractions from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">McNtpc.24</NUMEX> agrees with a previous study
        showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> activity in canalicular and
        sinusoidal membrane vesicles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The activation of
        PI3K in that report was also associated with recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> of P-glycoprotein (the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> export pump) and
        other multidrug resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the canalicular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Extended treatment of McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells
        does not appear to have detrimental and permanent
        consequences on cellular function. The marked morphological
        changes that occur during long term incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] dissipate after the withdrawal of the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> from
        the culture medium, and the cells remain viable.
        The significance of an intracellular and high affinity
        bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid binder</ENAMEX> in bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid mediated cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> was
        also evaluated. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> capable of binding bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in vitro have been identified (reviewed in ref. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        ). It is thought that the major bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid binding protein</ENAMEX>
        in the cytosol of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hepatocytes</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Î±</NUMEX>-hydroxysteroid
        dehydrogenase, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the aldo keto reductase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supergene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . However, the exact role of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in intracellular transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> and
        cytoprotection was undefined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the human
        aldo keto reductase gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, has been shown to bind
        bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with high affinity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) and is postulated
        to play a similar role as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Î±</NUMEX>-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
        in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> in
        McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells was expected to increase the capacity of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to sequester bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm, and
        thereby reduce their toxicity. High level expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> had a negligible effect on the ability of the BN
        clones to take up or secrete bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBAB</ENAMEX> has a minor role in the net transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> in
        these cells. More importantly however, expression of HBAB
        in McNtcp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> cells had no effect on GCDCA-induced cell
        death, even at low bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid concentrations</ENAMEX>, indicating
        that this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does not provide cytoprotection
        against toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> as previously suspected. This
        finding is consistent with the idea that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        directly modulate specific signaling cascades that control
        cellular death and survival.
        In summary, the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>.asbt cells to tolerate
        taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> has revealed the existence of
        a mechanism that may be specific for cells that normally
        metabolize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> undergo
        enterohepatic circulation, it would be reasonable to expect
        the existence of the same mechanism in other cell types
        that naturally transport bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, such as ileocytes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholangiocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> have brought
        significant advances in our understanding of bile acid
