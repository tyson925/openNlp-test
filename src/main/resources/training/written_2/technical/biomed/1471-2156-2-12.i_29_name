        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaucoma</ENAMEX> is a leading cause of blindness but its
        molecular etiology is poorly understood. Glaucoma involves
        retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage that is
        often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        It is becoming increasingly clear that many forms of
        glaucoma have a genetic component [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , and much
        current research is focused on identifying chromosomal
        regions and genes that contribute to glaucoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Identifying such loci allows screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        an increased risk of developing glaucoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Identifying genes contributing to elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma
        is only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, however, and animal models will
        provide systems for subsequent hypothesis testing and
        experimental dissection of pathogenesis.
        Due to conservation in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">physiology</ENAMEX> and the
        powerful tools of mouse genetics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are a very important
        experimental system for probing the functions (both in
        health and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>) of many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> recently identified by
        sequencing the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . We have focused on
        developing the mouse system for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma studies [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> are expected to be extremely
        helpful in characterizing genes and mechanisms that affect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> or the susceptibility of the optic nerve and retina to
        glaucomatous damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Very little is known about the magnitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of
        various mouse strains or IOP fluctuation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with time
        or other factors. Previously, we developed a method to
        measure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and reported initial findings on the
        magnitude of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The procedure involves
        direct measurement of pressure following cannulation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. The initial experiments demonstrated that
        in our hands careful ocular cannulation has a very minor
        effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.3</NUMEX> mmHg, mode <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.5</NUMEX> mmHg) and
        demonstrated significant differences in intraocular
        pressure levels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four</NUMEX> mouse strains. Here, we
        provide an update, including an extensive strain survey,
        and show that the methodology is reliable and produces
        reproducible data over extended periods of time.
      
      
        Results
        
          A broad range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> between strains
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the average IOP of a number of inbred
          mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental
          conditions. There is a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> with strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX>/cJ having one of the lowest average IOPs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.1</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmHg</ENAMEX>) and strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX> one of the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.3</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 mmHg</NUMEX>). Significant differences exist among various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> comparing
          strains within each sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>).
          Clinical and histological analysis of the eyes of all
          studied strains (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) did not identify anatomic
          or pathologic features that might account for the
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. For example, the iridocorneal angle
          and aqueous humor drainage structures are open to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> and have normal morphology in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX>/cJ and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 20%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had IOPs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 21</NUMEX> mmHg, which increases
          risk for glaucoma in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. We aged a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histologically</ENAMEX> analyzed
          their optic nerves and retinas but they did not develop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Strain differences are reproducible
          To assess the consistency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in specific strains,
          we measured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of each strain
          maintained under similar conditions at different times.
          We purposefully included strains at each end of the IOP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrum</ENAMEX>, and strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>) that is commonly used
          for genetic experiments (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The average IOP of
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of strains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaHN</ENAMEX> (both high
          end of spectrum) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> were consistent over time. This
          was true of most strains assessed on multiple occasions.
          Average IOP for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the same strain
          assessed at different times typically differed by no more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mmHg, and the differences were usually smaller.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strain 129P3/J</ENAMEX> was the most variable strain with the
          average IOP fluctuating by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2.5</NUMEX> mmHg.
          Despite the general consistency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of some strains have changed in a reproducible
          manner. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/cJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (low end of spectrum)
          were very similar for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmHg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between early 1996 and 1997</TIMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of
          this strain did jump from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7.7</NUMEX> mmHg to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> mmHg (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, the
          room in which our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were housed and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of the mouse diet were changed. Over the
          same period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> also increased dramatically,
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.4 ± 0.5 mmHg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.2 ± 0.4</NUMEX> mmHg
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. The increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> also was
          reproducible, with the average IOP of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> assessed in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> being <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.5 ± 0.4 mmHg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of strains <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> did not
          change during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.3</NUMEX>. ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mmHg in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12.4 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 14</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.7</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> mmHg in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13.6 ± 0.2 mmHg</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Effect of age on IOP
          We focused on the commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX> and
          C3H<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/HeJ</ENAMEX> strains to determine the effects of age on IOP
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX>, age had a significant effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was slightly decreased at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.2 ± 0.2 mmHg</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 months</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.2 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX>)
          compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.1 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.3</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX>). Although the decrease was of a similar level
          to the variation observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of control young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (see Methods) analyzed
          at the same times as the various B6 age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> did not
          decrease. For example, control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> analyzed at the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 month</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 month B6</TIMEX> age groups
          had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.0 ± 0.2 mmHg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.3 ± 0.2 mmHg</NUMEX> (n
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.7 ± 0.4 mmHg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>), respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was
          even lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 24 month</TIMEX> B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.8 ± 0.4 mmHg</NUMEX>), and
          again the average IOP of young controls measured at the
          same time was not changed (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.5 ± 0.2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>).
          In strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> did not differ significantly
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age between 3 and 14 months</TIMEX> but was lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>
          month old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX> compared to all younger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Despite a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mmHg dip in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 months</TIMEX>,
          there were no significant IOP differences between C3H/HeJ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at each age tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>). Although the
          effect of age has not been thoroughly assessed in other
          strains, no obvious age-related differences have been
          identified in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> analyzed at multiple ages
          except for the glaucomatous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD-28/Ty</ENAMEX> strains
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Effect of sex on IOP
          Although we have not rigorously assessed the effect of
          sex on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in many strains, sex specific differences have
          not been detected in the majority of strains for which
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> have been analyzed, and have proven
          inconsistent even within an individual strain analyzed
          multiple times. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strains B6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX> have been
          extensively evaluated at multiple ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 3 and 24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX>. Sex differences were always absent in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strain 129P3/J</ENAMEX> and typically absent in strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strain B6</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> infrequently had significantly
          higher IOP than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. For example, in one experiment,
          B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> had an average IOP of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.2 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>)
          whereas the average IOP of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.1 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX> (n
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). If real, this sporadic sex difference
          was not dependent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, sometimes occurring in a group
          of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at a particular age and sometimes not
          occurring in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the same age.
        
        
          Anesthesia protocol avoids <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> alteration and
          allows detection of diurnal differences
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> were assessed using an anesthetic regime of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> ketamine and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> xylazine (defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1X</ENAMEX>).
          Initial experiments suggested that an almost identical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 mg/kg</ENAMEX> ketamine and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg xylazine</NUMEX>) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anesthesia</ENAMEX> had no effect on IOP during the experimental
          period with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> being measured as soon as possible after
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was unconscious, typically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . To
          further assess the effects of anesthesia, we measured IOP
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genetically identical B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> subjected to
          different doses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1X</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.5X and 2X</TIMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 and 25 minutes</TIMEX>
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). For all doses, IOP
          decreased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 minutes</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> for time). The greater
          the dose the greater the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. At the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minute</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was the same using all doses
          suggesting that the anesthetic effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> had not yet
          occurred. To identify any early window when it may be
          possible to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> without an obvious anesthetic
          effect, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of strain B6 were anesthetized with the
          1X dose and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was measured at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute time</TIMEX> points
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> after administration (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> analyzed at each time point did
          not differ (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>) indicating that the IOP depressing
          effect of anesthesia occurs later than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> after
          administration. Similar results were obtained using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strain 129P3/J</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the 1X
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>). In support of a
          later effect of anesthesia (since general anesthesia is
          reported to mask diurnal variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ), we
          identified increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> during the dark compared to the
          light period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> in several tested strains (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In these experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> measurements were made
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> after administration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anesthesia</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Blood pressure does not correlate with IOP
          An initial study of the relationship between blood
          pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> did not detect a good
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).

          Myoc gene associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mouse strains</ENAMEX>, we analyzed the gene in an assortment of
          strains with different IOPs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were identified.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these alleles had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nucleotide insertion in the
          promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (ccagagcagggt, between positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-340</NUMEX> and
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX>) compared to the previously published sequence and
          is called the insertion allele. The other allele was
          identical to the published sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The
          insertion allele also had a previously reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> (A to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr164Ala</TIMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1</TIMEX> and several
          other single base changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          The presence or absence of this allele does not associate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> as it is present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> with a range of IOPs
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome has been implicated in strain
            specific blood pressure differences in rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
            To test if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome of strain <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">129/Ola</NUMEX> alters
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in relation to that of strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX>, we compared the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of pure B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">consomic</ENAMEX> B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> that had

            between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>).

            To test if deficiency of carbonic anhydrase <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> leads
            to decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, we analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">B6</NUMEX> background
            that were genetically similar but with normal or mutant
            alleles of the 
            Car2 gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . There was
            no difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> between normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX>
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>).

            To test if genetic perturbations that cause obesity
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> can alter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, we compared <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were
            genetically similar but were either homozygous or
            heterozygous for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leptin</ENAMEX> receptor mutation ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">db</ENAMEX> ) that results in obesity and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months of age</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BLKS/J</ENAMEX> strain
            background used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was modestly but
            significantly elevated in obese, diabetic homozygous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.7 ± 0.3 mmHg</NUMEX>) compared to non-obese,

            Tyr
            To determine if albinism alters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, we analyzed B6
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were either pigmented or albino. The albino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were homozygous and coisogenic for a mutant allele
            of tyrosinase ( 
            Tyr 
            c -2 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ) that arose on the otherwise
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigmented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> background. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
            homozygosity for 
            Tyr 
            c -2 
            J resulted in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.2</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">± 0.4 mmHg</NUMEX>) compared to wild type, pigmented <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.4</NUMEX>
            ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> mmHg, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). The same was true for
            independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of different ages that were
            analyzed at different times (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10A</NUMEX>). In contrast
            to pigmented B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of the albino
            B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were not increased at measurement during the
            dark compared to light period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>,

        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IOP</ENAMEX> differences are reproducible and amenable to
          genetic analyses
          We report the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> genetically different
          mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental
          conditions. The magnitude of IOP differences between
          strains and the good reproducibility of readings over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> will allow the use of genetic approaches to identify
          genes that underlie these differences. Using our method,
          a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> can measure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>. Thus it is feasible to assess sufficient numbers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis
          methods and to use these methods to identify chromosomal
          regions contributing to strain differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. The
          strain survey we report provides valuable information for
          designing these experiments. The throughput and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> also is sufficient for mutagenesis
          screens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . These are important approaches as
          they may allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glaucoma</ENAMEX> whose currently known functions do not suggest
          that they affect aqueous humor dynamics or do not
          immediately identify them as likely glaucoma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          No effect of anesthetic protocol on IOP during a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          minute measurement window
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Similarities</ENAMEX> and differences to rat
            studies
            Our results agree with the time course of
            cardiovascular depression caused by intraperitoneal
            administration of ketamine and xylazine in rats. In
            that study, anesthesia had a minor effect on blood
            pressure during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 15 minutes</TIMEX> following
            injection but a strong hypotensive effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 15</TIMEX>
            and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> that continued for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than an hour</TIMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, intraperitoneally administered
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) was shown to rapidly decrease IOP
            in a different rat study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> decreased
            significantly between a conscious measurement and the
            first possible measurement under anesthesia (defined as
            time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> decreased further by the next reading (at
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>) after which it remained stable for the
            duration of the experiment (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The
            time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> measurement in that study was at a very similar
            state of anesthesia as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our 4 and 5 minute time</TIMEX> points
            (starting as soon as possible and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 60</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> of adequate anesthesia), and the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minute</TIMEX> rat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point was similar to our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 and 10</NUMEX> minute
            measurement times. Thus, although both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and mouse
            studies show that anesthesia decreases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, the studies
            do not agree on the timing of the effect. The IOP
            depression occurred very soon after anesthesia in the
            rats but was delayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          Environment may influence the effect of
          anesthesia
          Factors that may influence the effect of anesthesia
          include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, strain and environment used.
          Essentially the same dose of ketamine and route of
          administration was used in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> IOP
          studies. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the strain does not appear to be
          important as no early effect of anesthesia was present in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distantly related laboratory strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] we
          studied in detail, and we have not observed any obvious
          effect during this period in any analyzed strain.
          Environmental differences may be important. Cage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleanliness</ENAMEX>, changing frequency and housing density can
          alter drug metabolism and the effect of anesthesia in
          rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . The type of bedding used also may be
          important. We use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood shavings</ENAMEX> for bedding and wood
          shavings expose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to terpenes. Terpene
          administration or environmental exposure to terpenes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX> shavings alters drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> and decreases the
          effect of anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44 45</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Risk factors for increased IOP
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>
            Although within the range of variability observed in
            young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> modestly decreased
            around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year of age</TIMEX>. This decrease was statistically
            significant compared to young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> measured at the same
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years of age</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had
            decreased further, though an effect of anesthesia in
            these very old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> cannot be ruled out [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also decreased with age but only at
            the oldest age examined (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Decreasing IOP</ENAMEX>
            correlates with increasing age in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
            population [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] . Further studies of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> may
            allow experimental investigation of this effect.
            Additional studies may also identify " normal" mouse
            strains that develop increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> with age as
            generally occurs in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . We
            previously demonstrated that the glaucomatous strains
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD-28/Ty</ENAMEX> develop elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> with age [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            Gender
            In the examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, we found no consistent
            differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. This was
            true at all ages for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> strains that were aged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months or older</TIMEX>. This is in agreement with a number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> studies, which show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is equal between the
            sexes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . However, some studies have found
            sex-specific differences (typically with higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and the magnitude of the difference increasing
            after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years of age</TIMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54</NUMEX> ] . Of possible
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relevance</ENAMEX>, we previously reported that female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strains DBA/2J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD-28/Ty</ENAMEX> develop elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> at
            an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            Blood pressure
            Some but not all human studies have reported a
            positive association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and blood pressure [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 52</NUMEX> ] . Our comparison of the relationship between
            blood pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in young, adult female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of
            different mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, whose blood pressures differed
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 36</NUMEX> mmHg, did not reveal a positive correlation.
            Further studies are needed to determine if blood
            pressure correlates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, and to determine
            the relationship between blood pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in
            various mouse strains with age.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> or higher body mass index have been
            implicated by some but not other studies as risk
            factors for increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 55 56 57</NUMEX> ]
            . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> have been variably associated with elevated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 52 58 59 60 61 62</NUMEX> ] . To test if
            genetic perturbations that cause obesity and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
            can alter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, we compared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were
            genetically similar except that they were either
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> or heterozygous for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leptin</ENAMEX> receptor
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">db</ENAMEX> ) that results in early onset
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The obese, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX> had
            higher IOPs than their lean, non-diabetic littermates.
            Thus, epidemiological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between increased
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and obesity or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> are supported by this work
            and appear to be functionally relevant. Further
            experiments with obese non-diabetic or diabetic
            non-obese <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> will help to characterize the separate
            effects of these risk factors.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is increased during the dark period of the
          day
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diurnal</ENAMEX> variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and
          laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The molecular mechanisms
          underlying the diurnal rhythm are not defined but
          increased aqueous humor production or flow occurs during
          the period of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in both rabbits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64 65</NUMEX> ] . Small changes in the resistance to aqueous
          humor drainage may also contribute to diurnal differences
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 67</NUMEX> ] . We first suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> changes with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of day when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of a group of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> measured
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> prior to onset of the dark period appeared to
          be higher than at other times of day. Previously, a rise
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was reported to occur before onset of the dark
          period in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and rabbits were shown
          to have higher IOP during the dark period compared to the
          light period [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 68 69</NUMEX> ] . Thus, we compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at different times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and identified several
          strains with significantly higher IOP during the dark
          compared to the light period. The magnitude of the
          difference varies with strain, and was greatest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWR/J.</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> increase in the dark is not dependent on
          functional rod and cone photoreceptors since these cells
          degenerate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWR</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> due to homozygosity for the 
          Pde6b 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rd 1mutation.</ENAMEX> In agreement with
          this finding, circadian regulation of wheel running by
          light was previously reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking rods and
          cones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX>,
          which has one of the highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> IOPs does not appear
          to increase in the dark. Further more detailed studies
          are needed to define the characteristics of the diurnal
          rhythm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intraocular</ENAMEX> pressure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and to determine
          whether it is lacking or has a different timing in strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX>. Analysis of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> strains may increase
          understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling
          diurnal rhythms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and that may be relevant to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Car2deficiency does not alter IOP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bicarbonate</ENAMEX> formation is important for aqueous humor
          secretion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ciliary</ENAMEX> processes and carbonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anhydrase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CA</ENAMEX>) facilitates this secretion. There are
          multiple forms of CA and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAII</ENAMEX> isoform is reported to
          be the predominant form in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ciliary</ENAMEX> processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72</NUMEX>
          ] . Our experiments show that a genetic deficiency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAII</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> homozygous for a mutation in the 
          Car2 gene does not alter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. CAIV
          activity was recently demonstrated in the ciliary
          processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] and so our data may support a more
          substantial role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAIV</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAII</ENAMEX> in aqueous
          humor secretion. It also is possible that CAII
          substantially contributes to aqueous humor secretion but
          that functional mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAIV</ENAMEX> is sufficient to prevent an
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAII deficiency</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in 
          Car2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX>. In support of a
          role for both enzymes, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> inhibition of
          CA is required for significant reduction of aqueous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Tyrosinase deficiency results in increased
          IOP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosinase</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> enzyme of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
          production pathway. Tyrosinase deficiency causes albinism
          and has various ocular consequences. These include
          alteration of the number of ipsilaterally projecting
          retinal axons and substantially increased light
          penetration past the iris [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] . It is not known if
          these abnormalities affect mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. Here, we show
          increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking tyrosinase activity
          compared to otherwise genetically identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigmented</ENAMEX> B6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> differences between the light and
          dark period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> were detected in the pigmented but
          not the albino B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Thus, albinism can affect the
          diurnal pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> changes. In agreement with this
          result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with albino eyes that are homozygous for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosinase</ENAMEX> or pink eye dilution mutations have altered
          diurnal rhythms compared to pigmented <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] .
          Albinism by itself is either not sufficient to alter the
          diurnal rhythm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> or alters it in different ways
          depending upon genetic background, however, since the
          albino strains <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/cByJ and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SWR/J</ENAMEX> had increased IOP
          during the dark. Diurnal rhythms are known to depend on
          visual pathways and to respond to light intensity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Exposing rats</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of low light abrogates the
          diurnal fluctuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and results in constantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated IOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Further experiments will determine
          the nature of the diurnal rhythm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in the albino B6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and if its alteration or other mechanisms result in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        A broad range of reproducible IOP differences exists
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inbred</ENAMEX> mouse strains and a diurnal rhythm of IOP
        exists in different strains. Various factors have been
        variably associated with risk for increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        Genetically uniform, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can be used to study the effects
        of these risk factors on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. In trained hands, our
        measurement procedure is reliable, accurate and rapid
        enough to allow large scale genetic studies of factors
        determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> have great potential for helping to
        characterize the molecular mechanisms affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Animal husbandry
          All experiments were performed in compliance with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVO</ENAMEX> statement for use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in ophthalmic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> research. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were bred and maintained at The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were housed in cages containing
          white pine bedding and covered with polyester filters.
          For most experiments, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were fed NIH31 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> fat)
          chow 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> , and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was
          acidified to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>. B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop diet induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> when maintained on a high fat diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . To
          ensure that we were analyzing the effect of age and not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the aging experiment were fed
          NIH31 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> fat) chow. We have found no differences in IOP
          between B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice housed</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> fat and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> fat versions
          of this otherwise identical diet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">housed</ENAMEX> and the cages were changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time per week. If
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> appeared soiled between scheduled changes, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were placed in a clean <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>. The environment was
          kept at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21°C</NUMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 hour light: 10 hour</TIMEX> dark cycle.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was monitored for specific pathogens by The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>'s routine surveillance program (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jax</ENAMEX>.orgfor specific pathogens).
        
        
          Intraocular pressure
          Intraocular pressures were measured as described
          elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 77</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were typically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acclimatized</ENAMEX> to the procedure room for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2 weeks</TIMEX>
          prior to measurement, but sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1 and 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Although it was not possible to include all
          strains in each measurement period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of different
          strains were intermixed. As demonstrated here, the IOPs
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> are very consistent over time and so these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were interspersed with experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> during
          all experiments to ensure that calibration had not
          drifted and that the system was functioning optimally.
          Whenever possible, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> measuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> did not
          know the genotypes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. It was not possible to
          analyze all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of each strain at the same time in
          the aging experiments. Therefore, to control for
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> changes due to measurement time and not
          age, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 3 month</TIMEX> old B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were assessed at
          the same time as each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. All dark period
          measurements were made <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1 and 3 hours</TIMEX> after the
          lights turned off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> was equipped with dim red
          lights and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were protected from all light exposure
          during set up. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was briefly exposed to the red
          light when the anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were administered. When
          adequate anesthesia was achieved (after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 to 4 minutes</TIMEX>),
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was placed on the measurement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and the
          white light of the microscope was turned on (for
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half minutes</TIMEX>) to allow ocular
          cannulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> measurement and post-measurement tests [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] that guard against artifactual data. The white light
          was used at very low intensity and was dim but we cannot
          rule out the possibility that this brief exposure altered
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. All other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were protected from light
          exposure throughout the time an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> mouse was
          analyzed.
        
        
          Blood pressure
          The blood pressures of conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of each strain
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 to 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> per strain) were measured with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX>-cuff system as reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] , except that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX>
          of training were used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were analyzed in the same
          procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> as was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> measurment.
        
        
          Clinical examinations
          For most strains, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior chambers</ENAMEX> were examined with
          a slit lamp biomicroscope [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of
          each strain shown in figure 1were evaluated. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BLKS/J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were only evaluated
          under a dissection microscope at the time of IOP
          measurement.
        
        
          Histological analysis
          Eyes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the listed strains were
          fixed (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fekete</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-alcohol</ENAMEX>-formalin fixative) processed, paraffin
          embedded and sectioned as previously reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 79</NUMEX> ] ,
          except that the paraformaldehyde was buffered with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer. All strains other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaHN</ENAMEX> and
          C57BLKS<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX> strains were evaluated. The eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA/CaJ</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX>/cJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were also fixed and processed for plastic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embedding</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historesin, Leica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>), and
          sectioned as previously reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 79</NUMEX> ] . Saggital
          sections including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> and optic nerve were
          collected and analyzed as they contain most ocular
          structures.
