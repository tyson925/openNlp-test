        Expression profiling is an emerging experimental method
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whereby RNA accumulation</ENAMEX> in cells and tissues can be
        assayed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously in a
        single experiment. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common experimental
        platforms for expression profiling; redundant
        oligonucleotide arrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChips</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and
        spotted cDNA microarrays [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The Affymetrix
        GeneChips have the inherent advantages of redundancy,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>, and transportability; there are typically
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-40</NUMEX> oligonucleotide probes (features) designed against
        each gene tested by the array, with paired perfect-match
        and mismatch probes, with standardized factory synthesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . The uniform nature of the arrays permits
        databasing of individual profiles, which facilitates
        comparison of data generated by different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
        Expression profiling has led to dramatic advances in
        understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast biology</ENAMEX>, where homogeneous cultures
        can be grown and exposed to timed environmental variables [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Such studies have led to the rapid
        assignment of function to a large number of anonymous gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Large-scale expression profiling studies of
        tissues from higher vertebrates are more challenging, due
        to the higher complexity of the genome, larger related gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and incomplete genomic resources. Nevertheless,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have been successfully applied in the
        analysis of aging and caloric restriction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and
        pulmonary fibrosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . And many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>,
        particularly on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, have appeared [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> has recently announced the availability of the
        U133 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> series with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,000</NUMEX> well-characterized human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes mined</ENAMEX> from genomic sequence. The nearly complete
        ascertainment of genes in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> should make
        expression-profiling studies of human tissues particularly
        powerful. However, identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX>, and knowledge of the relative
        contribution of variation from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, is critical for
        appropriate experimental design in expression profiling
        experiments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> recently studied the relative
        contribution of experimental variability of probe
        production on the reproducibility of microarray results
        using mixed murine tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> Mu11K GeneChips
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In their study, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> preparation was used
        as a template for distinct cDNA/cRNA amplifications and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. An additional variable studied was the
        effect of different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> processing the same RNAs.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found relatively poor concordance between
        duplicate arrays, with an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> increase/decrease
        calls between the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processed in parallel and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Mu11K-A microarrays. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        concluded that there was substantial experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the experimental procedure, necessitating
        extensive filtering and large numbers of arrays to detect
        accurate gene expression changes (LUT: look-up tables) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . In our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, we have processed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,200</NUMEX>
        Affymetrix arrays, and have found significantly higher
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reproducibility</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.979</NUMEX> for new generation
        U74A version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> murine arrays or human <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U95</NUMEX> series, see
        Result and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>). In addition, a recent publication
        of a single human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from two
        distinct breast tumors, and placed on duplicate U95A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX> chips total) found a very low degree of
        experimental variability between microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.995</NUMEX>),
        and between the two tumors (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.987</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The marked
        differences in experimental variability between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> could be due to different quality control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://microarray.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cnmcresearch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), newer
        more robust <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> now available (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">murine</ENAMEX> Mu11K
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">versus U74A version 2</ENAMEX> and new generation human <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U95</NUMEX> series),
        use of more recent algorithms for data interpretation, or
        due to more consistent processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, cDNA, and cRNA in
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
        The previous studies did not systematically address the
        reproducibility of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GeneChip hybridization</NUMEX> (e.g. the same
        biotinylated cRNA on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different microarrays). In
        addition to lingering questions concerning variability due
        to specific experimental procedures, there are other
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variability that have not yet been
        investigated, specifically tissue heterogeneity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual variation. The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        variability are particularly important in human expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> studies. The study of human tissues often
        involves the use of tissue biopsies, where a relatively
        limited region of an organ is sampled. Tissue heterogeneity
        and sampling error might be expected to introduce
        significant variability in expression profiles. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> may derive from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from different ethnic
        backgrounds; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are highly outbred, leading to the
        potential of significant polymorphic noise (herein called
        "SNP noise") between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> unrelated to the disease
        or variable under study. SNP noise also exists between
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inbred</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, and some experiments have
        normalized this effect by breeding the same mutation on
        different strains, and profiling each individually [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Knowledge of the relative effect of each experimental,
        tissue, and patient variable on expression profiling
        results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is important, so that appropriate
        experimental designs can be employed.
        We recently reported the design and production of a
        highly redundant oligonucleotide microarray for analysis of
        human muscle biopsies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borup et</ENAMEX> al. 
        submitted ). This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MuscleChip</ENAMEX> contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,369</NUMEX> distinct genes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> expressed in human muscle. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set contains
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 16 to 40</TIMEX> oligonucleotides, such that the number of
        specific oligonucleotide probes on the array was
        138,000.
        Here, we utilize this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuscleChip</ENAMEX> to investigate the
        relative significance of variables affecting expression
        profiling data and interpretation. Specifically, we studied
        the correlation coefficients of profiles considering the
        following variables: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. variation due to probe production
        (same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. variation due to the microarray itself (same
        cRNA on different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneChips</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. tissue heterogeneity
        (different regions of the same muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">biopsy</ENAMEX>); 4.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> variability (SNP noise); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. diagnosis
        (underlying pathological variable); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. patient age.
        We have recently reported generation of expression
        profiling results using mixed patient samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Our
        hypothesis was that mixing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from multiple
        regions of muscle biopsies, and from multiple patients
        matched for most variables (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, age, sex), would
        effectively normalize both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-patient</ENAMEX> variability
        (tissue heterogeneity), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inter-patient</ENAMEX> variability (SNP
        noise; e.g. normal human polymorphic variation unrelated to
        the primary defect). Here, we test this hypothesis
        directly, and show that sample mixing does indeed result in
        relatively high sensitivity and specificity for gene
        expression changes that would be detected by many
        individual expression profiles. Thus, sample mixing appears
        to be an appropriate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-pass method to obtain the most
        significant expression changes, while using small numbers
        of arrays.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">56</NUMEX>) different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> were prepared from
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of muscle biopsies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> Duchenne muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX> (DMD) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13 normal</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>). The profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> controls have been previously reported using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix HuFL</ENAMEX> microarray [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ; however, we re-tested
        these same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> on the custom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MuscleChip</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borup et</ENAMEX> al. 
        submitted ) for comparison to the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> here. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were converted to
        double-stranded cDNA, and then to biotinylated cRNA. The
        cRNAs were then hybridized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuscleChip</ENAMEX> either singly,
        in mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, or both, as described below. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        hybridizations were performed, scanned, and the data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistically</ENAMEX> analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX>. Quality control criteria were as described on
        our web site ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://microarray.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cnmcresearch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>, link to
        "programs in genomic applications"), and included
        sufficient cRNA amplification, and adequate
        post-hybridization scaling factors. Scaling factors
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">normalization</ENAMEX> needed to reach a common target intensity)
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.46 to 3.28</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). All raw image files,
        processed image files, and difference analyses are posted
        on a web-queried SQL database interface to our Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIMS Oracle</ENAMEX> warehouse (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://microarray.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cnmcresearch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>: link to "programs in
        genomic applications", "data", "human").
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> custom
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX>, we found a consistent percentage of
        "present" calls for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> cRNA samples tested
        (Duchenne dystrophy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> arrays, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.2% ± 6.1%</NUMEX>; controls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        arrays, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.3% ± 1.4%</NUMEX>). To test for inter-array variability,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization solutions</ENAMEX> were applied to
        duplicate arrays, and correlation coefficients determined.
        A high correlation coefficient was found in this analysis,
        suggesting that inter-array variability of the MuscleChip
        used was a relatively minor variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Patient 3 a and</ENAMEX>
        3a-duplicate R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX> and percent shared [No Change (NC)]
        calls by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Suite</ENAMEX> software was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 3b</ENAMEX> and
        3b-duplicate R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX> and percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        The high reproducibility of Affymetrix array results is
        consistent with other data in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and from
        previously published data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 21 23 24</ENAMEX> ] , and shows that
        experimental variability associated with hybridization and
        scanning of highly redundant oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> is
        not a major source of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX>.
        Given the previous report suggesting that the conversion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> to biotinylated cRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was a major source of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in murine array experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , we tested
        a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">murine RNA</ENAMEX> from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, using the
        newer generation U74Av2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> series of samples
        was from murine spleens, where spleens from multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> for each variable under study were mixed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        isolated, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> split, and duplicate cDNA, cRNA, and
        hybridizations processed in parallel for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">KNagaraju</ENAMEX>" samples). We also compared RNAs processed from
        parallel murine myogenic cell cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VSM</ENAMEX>"
        samples), where each profile was from a different cell
        culture. Finally, we used a series of murine muscle tissues
        from normal and dystrophin-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, where each
        profile was from a different series of complete
        gastrocnemius muscles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FBooth</ENAMEX>" samples). The data
        from these <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 murine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U74Av2</ENAMEX> profiles were then analyzed by
        unsupervised clustering [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] to determine which profiles
        were most closely related to each other (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This
        analysis shows that the different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> cluster
        together, as expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> used as a
        template for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct cDNA/cRNA preparations and
        hybridizations showed a high correlation coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.99</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, with average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.978</NUMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The large muscle group profiles (FBooth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>)
        showed excellent correlation, both with respect to
        diagnosis; however here there was no sampling error as the
        entire muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was used rather than isolated biopsies.
        Finally, the parallel tissue culture experiments (VSM
        samples) showed greater variability between duplicates,
        suggesting that tissue culture conditions may be more
        subject to variability than 
        in vivo tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> shows that variability from different cDNA-cRNA
        reactions is very low (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.978</NUMEX>).
        To analyze the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-patient</ENAMEX> variability
        (tissue heterogeneity), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inter-patient</ENAMEX> variability
        (polymorphic noise in outbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>), and the effect
        of sample mixing on the sensitivity of detection of gene
        expression differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient groups</ENAMEX>, we conducted
        a series of individual and mixed profiling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Muscle biopsies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five 4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> yr old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-12</NUMEX> yr old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were selected, each biopsy split into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated independently from each of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> biopsy fragments. For these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> DMD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the two
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the same biopsy were expression
        profiled both individually (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> profiles), and also mixed
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pools where each pool originated from distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The resulting profiles were also
        compared to previously reported mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-9</ENAMEX> yr old DMD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient cRNAs</ENAMEX>, and mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-9</ENAMEX> yr old control cRNAs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ,
        as mentioned above.
        As an initial statistical analysis, we used Affymetrix
        software to define genes that showed expression changes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Increased, Decreased or Marginal</ENAMEX>) in expression levels
        between pairs of profiles (difference analyses). This
        method of data interpretation showed that some muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX> showed very little variance between different
        regions of the same biopsy, while other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> biopsies
        showed considerable variability (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative scatter</ENAMEX> graphs). Expressing this variance as
        a percentage of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diff Calls</ENAMEX>" between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of the
        same biopsy, as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> default
        algorithms, we found considerable variability in the
        similarity of profiles, with values ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> studied (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.99% ± 4.94%</NUMEX>). This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggests that tissue heterogeneity (intra-patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>) can be a major source of variation in
        expression <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">profiling</ENAMEX> experiments, even when using
        relatively large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 mg</NUMEX>) of relatively homogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (such as muscle).
        The most common strategy for interpreting Affymetrix
        microarray data is to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> profile comparisons, with an
        arbitrary threshold for "significant fold-change" in
        expression levels. Typically, multiple arrays are compared,
        with those gene expression changes showing the most
        consistent fold changes prioritized, although other methods
        have been reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 22 26 27</NUMEX> ] . To study inter-patient
        variability, we defined the gene expression changes
        surviving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pairwise comparisons with mixed control
        samples, as we have previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparisons were done by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> software (eg. DMD
        1a versus control 1a; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> versus control 1b; DMD1b
        versus control 1a; DMD1b versus control 1b). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> data
        sets were then compared, with only those gene expression
        changes that showed ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparison survival method). The number
        of surviving diff calls by this method ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">355 ± 80</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, those patients
        showing considerable variation between different regions of
        the same biopsy did not show a corresponding decrease in
        the number of gene expression changes surviving the
        iterative comparisons to controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This suggests
        (but does not prove) the most significant changes might be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX>, independent of tissue variability (see below).
        A different statistical method to determine the effect
        of the different variables under study is to perform
        hierarchical cluster analysis using nearest neighbor
        statistical methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Here, we subjected all
        profiles to unsupervised cluster analysis, as a means of
        determining which variables had the greatest effect (e.g.
        intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient variability</ENAMEX> [different regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biopsy</ENAMEX>],
        versus diagnosis [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> vs control], versus inter-patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in same age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>], versus age of
        patient). For this analysis, we used the fluorescence
        intensity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set (Average difference), after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> scrubbing to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that showed expression
        levels near background (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Absent" Calls</ENAMEX>) for all profiles
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This analysis shows that duplicate profiles of
        the same cRNA hybridization solution are the most highly
        related (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patient 3</ENAMEX> a and duplicate (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a-d</TIMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3b</ENAMEX> and duplicate
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b-d</TIMEX>)), consistent with the high correlation found by the
        comparisons using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> software
        described above. Again, this reflects the low amount of
        combined experimental variability intrinsic to the
        laboratory processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, cDNA, cRNA and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>.
        When comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different regions of the same biopsy
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-patient variability</ENAMEX>], we found widely varying
        results, depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> studied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For
        example, some individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed very closely
        related profiles that approached the similarity of
        duplicate arrays on the same cRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; profiles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>;
        10a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10b</TIMEX>). On the other hand, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed very
        distantly related profiles for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; profiles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4b</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9b</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the variation caused by intra-patient tissue
        variation often overshadowed all other variables. For
        example, a profile from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> 9 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9a</NUMEX>) clustered with
        the normal controls, rather than with the other DMD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The histopathology of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
        noted as being unusually variable in severity prior to
        expression profiling. Also, unsupervised clustering was
        unable to group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of similar ages, despite DMD
        showing a progressive clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>. We conclude that
        intra-patient tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> is a major source of
        experimental variability in expression profiling, and must
        be considered in experimental design.
        The above findings suggested that both intra-patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> (tissue heterogeneity) and inter-patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> (polymorphic noise) had major effects on the
        expression profiles. One method to control for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of noise is to analyze large numbers of profiles,
        both on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and on multiple regions of
        tissue from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. This would allow determinations
        of p values and statistical significance for a single
        controlled variable under study (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> vs controls). An
        alternative method is to experimentally normalize these
        variables through mixing of samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient groups</ENAMEX>;
        such mixing would be expected to average out both intra-
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inter-patient</ENAMEX> variation. The expectation is that the
        most significant and dramatic gene expression changes would
        still be identified, while using many less profiles (and
        thus a substantial reduction in cost of the analyses).
        To test for the relative sensitivity of interpretation
        of sample mixing versus individual profiles, we mixed
        together the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cRNAs for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (samples <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a - 5b</TIMEX>; samples <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6a - 10b</ENAMEX>). For this
        analysis, we also generated expression profiles for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. One was a second
        set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> normal male biopsies ages <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-12 yrs</TIMEX> (controls
        2a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> normal
        age-matched female biopsies ages <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-13 yrs</TIMEX> (controls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). As with the original male control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (control
        1a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different regions of each biopsy were
        processed independently through the biotinylated cRNA step,
        and then equimolar amounts of cRNA mixed for hybridization
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuscleChip</ENAMEX>.
        All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> profiles (both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and mixed samples) were
        again analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . As described above, we scrubbed the
        profiles to eliminate all genes showing expression levels
        consistently at or below background hybridization
        intensities by requiring each gene to show a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Present Call</ENAMEX>"
        in one or more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> profiles.
        As above, duplicate profiles using the same cRNA
        hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> on different arrays, whether mixed
        or individual samples, showed very highly correlated
        results (very low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> on dendrogram) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; mix <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-6</ENAMEX>
        yrs, mix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-12</NUMEX> yrs; patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a/3</NUMEX>a-d; patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3b/3b-d</ENAMEX>). As
        above, this indicates that experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX> from
        laboratory procedures or different arrays is a relatively
        minor factor in interpretation of results. Mixed samples
        from different regions of the same biopsies showed the
        same, or only slightly more variation (mixed controls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">c1</TIMEX>,
        c2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c3</ENAMEX>, mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yrs</ENAMEX>). This showed that sample
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixing</ENAMEX> does indeed average out tissue heterogeneity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-patient</ENAMEX> variability), as well as inter-patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. We noted that all of the controls (both male
        and female) clustered in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the dendrogram,
        while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> mixed DMD profiles clustered just
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> level away from the controls, separately from the other
        DMD profiles. This analysis suggests that there is
        considerable variability in the progressive tissue
        pathology induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dystrophin deficiency</ENAMEX>, both within a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        To test the sensitivity and specificity of sample mixing
        versus individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiling</ENAMEX>, we defined differentially
        expressed genes using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> t-test (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneSpring</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] ), comparing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mixed control profiles and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-6</ENAMEX> yr old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> profiles. Genes were retained
        that met specific p value thresholds between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets
        of profiles. In parallel, we compared the two corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mixed 5-6</ENAMEX> yr old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> profiles to the same 6 mixed control
        profiles.
        Comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Duchenne</ENAMEX> dystrophy
        profiles to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mixed controls revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,498</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showing
        differential expression with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        Comparison of the two mixed Duchenne dystrophy profiles to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mixed controls showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). Comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene lists showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> regulated genes detected by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        individual profiles were also detected by the two mixed
        profiles. This suggests that the sensitivity and
        specificity of using mixed samples is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately half</NUMEX>
        that of individual profiles. However, there was a rapid
        shift in specificity and sensitivity as stringency of the
        analysis was increased. Raising the statistical threshold
        to p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX> for individual profiles, while keeping the
        threshold for mixed profiles at p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> as required by
        the small number of data points (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B), resulted in a
        sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> for mixed samples (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">408</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> p
        < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX> detected). In conclusion, mixing detected about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of statistically significant changes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mixing</ENAMEX> was a relatively sensitive method of
        detecting the most highly significant changes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> of changes detected), however it was not very
        specific; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as one third</NUMEX> of gene expression changes
        showing p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> in mixed samples were not confirmed by
        individual profiles.
        Use of t-test measurements is expected to contain
        significant amounts of noise, due to the very large number
        of comparisons involved in array studies; a value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        0.05 means that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 5%</NUMEX> of gene expression changes
        are expected to be identified by "chance", and thereby not
        reflect true differences between samples. We have
        previously reported a very simple, yet potentially more
        stringent method for data analysis of small numbers of
        expression profiles, using duplicate profiles for control
        and experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and then identifying those genes
        that show consistent changes ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise data comparisons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparison
        survival method) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . A similar pair-wise comparison
        method, using a less stringent average fold-change
        analysis, was recently reported for muscle from aging and
        calorie-restricted mouse muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        To investigate the validity of this approach we compared
        the sensitivity and specificity of t-test detection of
        expression changes versus the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-pairwise survival
        method. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sample t-test of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> Duchenne
        dystrophy profiles compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mixed control profiles
        revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,498</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showing p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> as above. In
        parallel, the mixed DMD duplicate profiles were compared to
        a single pair of mixed control sample profiles (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c1a, c1b</ENAMEX>),
        using the pairwise comparison survival method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparisons were done (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> versus control
        1a; DMD1b versus control 1a; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> versus control 1b;
        DMD1b versus control 1b), and only those genes retained
        which showed ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> comparisons.
        This method was indeed considerably more specific in
        identifying significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) gene expression
        changes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of gene expression changes in
        the mixed profiles verified by individual profiles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). The sensitivity of this method depended on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value threshold for the individual profiles, but only
        reached a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> sensitivity at p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        6B).
        The results above suggested that analysis of mixed
        samples using t-test methods was relatively sensitive but
        non-specific, while analysis of the same mixed profiles by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold survival method was relatively specific but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insensitive</ENAMEX>. To confirm this conclusion, we directly
        compared the sensitivity and specificity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        pairwise comparison method to more standard t-test methods
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). We found that the pairwise survival method was
        indeed highly specific, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> of changes identified by
        this method also detected by t-test. However, as predicted,
        it was not very sensitive, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30%</NUMEX> of the expression
        changes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> identified by t-test being
        detected by the pairwise survival method. Comparison of all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> analysis methods showed that many (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">349</ENAMEX>) genes
        expression changes were detected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> methods (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        7B).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Microarray data analyses have been criticized as being
        "quite elusive about measurement reproducibility" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        This is largely the consequence of the large number of
        uncontrolled or unknown variables, and the prohibitive cost
        of isolating and investigating each variable. Here, we
        report the systematic isolation and study of most variables
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> and human tissue biopsies. We found that all sources
        of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX> were quite minor (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">microarray</NUMEX> R
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>; probe synthesis + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">microarray</NUMEX> R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>).
        On the other hand, tissue heterogeneity (intra-patient
        variation; Average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>]), and differences between individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (SNP
        noise; Average R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX>]) were major sources
        of variability in expression profiling. Thus, tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> noise have a high potential to
        obscure sought after condition-specific gene expression
        changes, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, where tissue samples can
        be limiting (sampling error), and inter-individual
        variation often is very large. We have shown that mixing of
        patient samples effectively normalizes much of the intra-
        and inter-patient noise, while still identifying the
        majority of the most significant gene expression changes
        that would have been detected by larger numbers of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> profiles. Our results suggest that
        stringent yet robust data can be generated by mixing a
        small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with a defined condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), preferably using different regions of tissue for
        duplicate arrays. Controls should be similarly processed.
        The resulting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four arrays</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> controls, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>) should then be subjected to the ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        survival method, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This will
        yield a stringent set of expression changes that are likely
        to be verified by larger studies with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>,
        but at low cost as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> are employed. The
        preliminary data from just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mixed profiles (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        experimental and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> control) can then be used to generate
        functional clusters and pathophysiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. These
        preliminary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can then direct more hypothesis-driven
        experiments, or more extensive expression profiling
        studies.

          Expression profiling
          Human muscle biopsy samples were diagnostic specimens
          flash-frozen immediately after surgery in isopentane
          cooled in liquid nitrogen, with storage in small,
          airtight, humidified tubes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C until</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation.
          Duchenne muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy patient</ENAMEX> samples were all
          shown to have complete lack of dystrophin by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX> and/or immunoblot analysis, and were shown
          to have excellent morphology and preservation of tissue.
          Controls included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> (age
          described in text) that showed no histopathological
          abnormality, normal dystrophy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and normal serum
          creatine kinase levels. Biopsy sizes ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg to
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 grams</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 20-30</NUMEX> mg used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10-15 micrograms</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>). As described
          in the text, all biopsies had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different regions of
          the same biopsy expression profiled separately.
          Details concerning the murine profiles will be
          published elsewhere. In this report, we used the murine
          profiles simply to test the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variation during
