        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>'s) are the effectors of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and
        necessarily impact multiple target tissues during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal</TIMEX>
        function. Regulation of GC levels occurs through the
        hypothalamo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pituitary</NUMEX>-adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">axis</ENAMEX> (HPA). Recent evidence
        indicates that the cytokine, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> inhibitory factor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX>) and its functional binding to the high affinity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, a heterodimer between low-affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> 130 (LIFR:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gp130</ENAMEX>), are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> within the HPA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> of events. The ligands ciliary neurotrophic factor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNTF</ENAMEX>), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and a novel neurotrophin
        set, known alternatively as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NNT-1/BSF3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLF/CLC</ENAMEX>, also
        function through the high affinity LIFR:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp130</NUMEX> heterodimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> but require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> ligand-binding but
        non-signaling subunit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oncostatin M</ENAMEX> (OSM)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilizes</ENAMEX> LIFR:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp130</ENAMEX> as an alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> for
        OSM signaling in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Thus, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> LIFR:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp130</ENAMEX> is obligatory for signaling
        induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNTF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CT-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLF/CLC</ENAMEX>. Signaling proceeds
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>/signal transducers and activators
        of transcription (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAK/STAT</ENAMEX>) or the ras-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mitogen</NUMEX>-activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) kinase pathways [for a review see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        ].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> are functionally expressed in rodent
        tissues that are central to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> production: the hypothalamus
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and pituitary [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> works in synergy
        with corticotropin-releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (CRH) in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> to increase pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX>) and, ultimately, pituitary adrenocorticotrophin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX> (ACTH) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 11 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> also stimulates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> gene expression directly in the pituitary [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 11 15 17</NUMEX>
        ] . LIF up-regulates pituitary prohormone convertase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PC1</NUMEX>).
        Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PC1</ENAMEX> goes on to facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POMC</ENAMEX> processing to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] within the pituitary. LIF promotes survival of
        magnocellular vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] which ultimately also positively influences ACTH
        level. Thus, it is well documented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> that
        signaling through the LIFR:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp130</NUMEX> heterodimer in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> and pituitary leads to adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> production
        via elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX>. Other LIF effects that may influence the
        stress response through actions in the rodent nervous
        system are a LIF induced increase in acetylcholine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> induced decreases in neuropeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> and tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . LIFR:gp130 signaling has strong
        effects in systems peripheral to but influenced by the HPA
        including reproductive, skeletal, nervous, neuromuscular,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX>, hematopoietic, immune and metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, with influences on both development and adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> [for reviews see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 22 23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] ].
        Animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> over expression and ablation have
        confirmed importance in stress regulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Adult mouse</ENAMEX> LIF
        over expression mediated by transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> over expressing
        hematopoietic cells results in a lethal, multi-systemic
        phenotype that includes small adrenals with a loss of the
        innermost cortical layer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Pituitary specific LIF
        over expression leads to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cushing's Syndrome</ENAMEX>-like
        condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> hyperactivity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> null adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have normal or slightly reduced basal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> and GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and are unable to respond to acute stress
        by increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal POMC</ENAMEX> is reduced, but inducible
        upon stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Thus, an obligatory function of LIF
        may be in the processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> during acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        Null mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> results in neonatal death and
        defects in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> including absence of glial cells,
        osteoporosis, glycogen hyper-synthesis, placental defects [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] and loss of motor neuronal subsets that cripple
        suckling ability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In all of the systems affected as
        a biological consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss, an explanation of
        the mechanism of action can be designed around direct
        action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> in each system. However, when considered as
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX>, direct, non-redundant obligatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> function in
        such diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> makes little evolutionary sense. LIFR
        function within the stress response system could be a
        unifying element in many of the diverse biological
        consequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss. Among the defects seen upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developmental LIFR</ENAMEX> loss, all but the loss of suckling
        ability and placental changes mirror reported effects of GC
        excess in the adult. This study explores the effect of
        alteration of the GC environment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late gestation</TIMEX>,
        with the expectation that suppression of GC effects will
        improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> and identify LIFR
        as an obligatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in concert with the maternal GC
        surge during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX> gestation development. To link LIFR
        function with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> function we have manipulated the late
        gestation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal steroid</ENAMEX> profile by maternal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> or RU486 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to determine if the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maternal GC</ENAMEX> surge impacts fetal well being in the absence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> and functional LIFR:gp130 signaling. RU486
        administration during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late gestation</TIMEX> results in improved
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, skeletal muscle, and glial cells in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null fetuses.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mice</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> used in this study were first described in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Disruption of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coding exon with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">promterless Î²-galactosidase/</ENAMEX>neomycin resistance fusion
          cassette [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] created a null allele for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> . AB1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells, on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a129S7/SvEvBrd-</ENAMEX> 
          Hprt 
          b - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m 2background</ENAMEX>, were used for
          targeting 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were sent to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Induced Mutant Resource of the Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, from where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> heterozygous ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr +/-</ENAMEX>) male was received in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>
          to re-establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Since the initial germ line chimera, the line
          has been bred back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and
          there have been several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of sibling matings.
          Thus, although exact records were not kept, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
          on a predominantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> background (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>). All work
          was carried out following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Use Committee</ENAMEX> guidelines within an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care</ENAMEX>
          approved specific pathogen-free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were mated to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of plug
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E0.5</NUMEX>) recorded. Pups were either born naturally or
          derived by Cesarean section (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>section) on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX> as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> were placed in a dish
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> to induce hypothermia and sleep followed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euthanasia</ENAMEX> through decapitation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tail</ENAMEX> snips were used for
          genotyping by polymerase chain reaction as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Hormone manipulation
          E16.5 was chosen as the starting point for each
          treatment since no phenotypic differences among the 
          Lifr genotypes was detected at this
          point. Noticeable differences were seen beginning on
          E17.5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Also, fetal feedback control of GC
          production is established on E16.5 coincident with the
          initiation of the maternal surge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Adrenalectomy
          of E16.5 pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was performed as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized
          using ketamine and xylazine. The site was prepped and a
          small incision (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1 cm</NUMEX>) made on the right side of the
          spine over the upper kidney. The adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX> was
          located and excised, with care taken to avoid damage of
          blood vessels. Following removal of the right adrenal,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> suture was placed to close the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">incision</ENAMEX>. The
          adrenalectomy procedure was repeated on the left side.
          The skin was closed using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX> wound clip. No hormonal
          support was provided. Pups were born following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>section
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> litters containing in total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups were studied. Within
          litter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ and +/- pups served as
          controls since there has been no detectable gene dose
          effect between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ and +/- at this stage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. No mock surgeries were performed.

          Program) was dissolved to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and diluted
          to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut oil</ENAMEX>. RU486 was administered as a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups were studied. These
          were compared with their littermates and to control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that experienced no hormone intervention.
          C-section delivery of untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was

          Histology
          E18.5 fetuses were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          for paraffin sectioning. Paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> were cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼m</ENAMEX> sections, deparaffinized and hydrated to water prior
          to staining. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&E</ENAMEX>) or by periodic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiff</ENAMEX> (PAS). For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>, slides were placed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> periodic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. They were rinsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and placed in
          Schiff reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, washed and
          counterstained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hematoxylin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). Slides
          treated with diastase to digest sugars were compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">untreated</ENAMEX> slides to control for specificity of PAS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. Immunohistochemistry was performed using
          antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> (rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTH; Chemicon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>) or glial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibrillary acid protein</ENAMEX> (rabbit
          polyclonal anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP; Chemicon International</ENAMEX>). Antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> was visualized using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Quick Kit</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NovaRed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector</ENAMEX>).
          Skeletal preparations followed a combination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protocols of Gendron-Maguire et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rijli et</ENAMEX>
          al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, the fetuses were eviscerated, the
          skin was removed and they were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> in acetone. They were
          rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and transferred to staining solution
          which contained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> volume of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alizarin</ENAMEX> red S (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>),

          for storage.
          Only within litter <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were compared. Following
          detection of differences, an array of slides and tissues
          were presented to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist blinded</ENAMEX> to genotype for
          confirmation. The numbers of pups observed for each
          parameter are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Radio-immune assay (RIA) for corticosterone
          Samples were run at a dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200</ENAMEX> using a kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN</ENAMEX>) in the recommended diluent using the kit protocol.
          The standards spanned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.125</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.00</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          run in the same assay with high and low controls.
          Samples, standards and controls were run in duplicate and
          results averaged. Blanks were run in quadruplicate and
          results averaged. The standard curve was calculated using
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-parameter logistic curve fit. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 25-87%</NUMEX> bound. The coefficient of variance between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicate samples</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> or less for all samples,
          standards and controls.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consistent Phenotype</ENAMEX>
          The phenotype due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss has remained consistent
          throughout the transition through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and between the transition from,

          particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null mutation remains a neonatal lethal
          with associated osteopenia and an absence of glial cells
          in late gestation, as described below.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altered GC Action</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> approaches were used to attempt to reduce the
          effects of the maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> surge on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>. The first
          approach toward manipulating the maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> surge was
          maternal adrenalectomy on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX>, without further GC
          support. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups could not be
          identified by gross morphology or behavior. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups</ENAMEX> from adrenalectomized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were noticeably smaller than the littermates and
          did not move vigorously. The gross morphology and
          behavior could accurately identify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups following treatment
          that presumably heightened the fetal exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>'s.
          Thus, the impact of maternal adrenalectomy on the fetuses
          appeared to have a selective negative effect on the
          development of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups.</ENAMEX>
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach was to administer RU486 on E16.5
          and E17<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> to block the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> surge at the GR
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>, following placental
          transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . We wanted to find a dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> that
          allowed litters to be born on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX> by natural delivery
          since E18.5 is the earliest day of natural birth seen in
          unmanipulated pregnancy. A dose of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-10 Î¼g</NUMEX> per mouse
          generally, but not consistently, caused abortion on
          E17<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>. Pups were born after E18<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> following a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          Î¼g <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">RU486</NUMEX> per mouse per day. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Î¼g</NUMEX> per mouse dose
          induced birth on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX>. However, response throughout was
          individual.
          A pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RU486</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX>. Following natural delivery on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX>, the one 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pup was indistinguishable
          from the littermates both by size and vigor, but
          succumbed to the soporific effect of hypothermia before
          its littermates. Subsequently, a further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> litters
          similarly treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> were born by natural
          delivery and left with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> pups that survived to weaning, none were 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-.</ENAMEX> No pups were excluded
          from the litters on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of birth; however, the
          remains of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> were found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>. Only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pup</ENAMEX> found dead on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after birth was of
          sufficient quality to genotype, and, as expected, it was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-.</ENAMEX> Two more litters of RU486
          treated pups were born by natural delivery on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX>.
          These litters were taken on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX> for analysis. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> accepted all the pups into the litters. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> pups
          had not suckled, as evidenced by the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in
          their stomachs, while the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> had. All were otherwise
          clinically normal. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> with no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, three
          succumbed to hypothermia more rapidly than the rest.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> proved to be 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional pup
          with no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in its stomach, but that resisted the effect
          of hypothermia the longest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr +/-.</ENAMEX> All the littermates that
          had suckled and had detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in their stomachs
          were 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 pups</NUMEX>) or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr +/-</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 pups</NUMEX>). Consequently,
          RU486 allowed the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups to survive natural
          delivery and maternal culling, although they apparently
          succumbed due to an inability to suckle.
        
        
          Bone
          There was no loss of density at the growth plate
          following any of the treatments in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lifr +/+ and +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (Figure
          1A,1C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>). The expected loss of density was seen at the
          growth plate in the untreated control and maternal
          adrenalectomy exposed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
          Fragility may be increased in the adrenalectomy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as
          evidenced by broken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineralized bone</ENAMEX> at the growth plate,
          presumably due to osteopenia combined with handling post
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mortem</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups</ENAMEX> from pregnancies
          where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was adrenalectomized, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> had broken bones
          once the staining was complete, whereas, no stained bones
          from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ and +/- littermates were
          broken. In addition, all bones from both control and
          RU486 exposed litters remained intact throughout the
          staining process. RU486 treatment of the mother
          noticeably protected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups</ENAMEX> from bone loss
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1F</NUMEX>), although modest thinning could still be
          seen, suggesting that protection was incomplete.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glial Cell Formation</ENAMEX>
          Consistent with previous findings, no GFAP positive
          cells could be detected in the spinal cord of either of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          Ordinarily very few GFAP positive cells are seen at this
          stage of development in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type animals</ENAMEX>, making
          detection of GFAP positive cells dependent on particular
          spinal cord section viewed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> control 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr +/+, 5</ENAMEX> control 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-, 8</ENAMEX> RU486 exposed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ and +/- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> RU486
          exposed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> spinal cord sections were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunolabeled</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> became detectable in the sections
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> E18.5 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> analyzed when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> was given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX> of gestation
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Although, immunolabeling was reduced relative
          to that seen in wild type. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> immuno-positive cells
          were often associated with blood vessels in the spinal
          cord. Although staining was relatively spare in all
          sections, complete absence of any labeling near vessels
          was apparent in the control 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> spinal cord (Figure
          2B).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeletal Muscle</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle integrity appeared compromised in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> relative to wild
          type (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>). This was evidenced by a frayed,
          granular appearance with loss of staining intensity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> untreated controls. On
          closer examination, the individual muscle fibers
          contained fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacuoles</ENAMEX> formed within the sarcoplasm
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, arrows). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- pups</ENAMEX> treated with RU486
          completely lacked this phenotype and appeared normal. The
          characteristic appearance of skeletal muscle in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> may be due to altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> as evidenced by glycogen accumulation. Modest,
          but inappropriate glycogen accumulation was also seen in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> periodic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-Schiff
          stained skeletal muscle (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Glycogen was barely
          detectable in comparable tissues from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">or</NUMEX> +/- littermates (Figure
          3A).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pituitary</ENAMEX> ACTH
          Immuno-staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> in the pituitary showed no
          profound difference due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4B</ENAMEX>).
          Treatment with RU486 resulted in apparent pituitary ACTH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation as evidenced by increased immunolabeling
          regardless of genotype (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand 4D</ENAMEX>). The strongest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> immunolabeling was seen in the pars intermedia of
          the anterior pituitary with scattered labeling in the
          pars distalis. This was an appropriate pattern for the
          corticotroph <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Thus, the corticotrophs did not
          seem altered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss using this method of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>'s induce negative feedback regulation on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pituitary ACTH</ENAMEX> production, as a mechanism for protecting
          against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> overproduction. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> is a GR
          antagonist, it is known that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> can cause
          increased pituitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . RU486
          exposure increased pituitary ACTH levels in both the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lifr +/+ and -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, as judged
          by the apparent increase in labeling density through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX>. Increased pituitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> indicates
          that, in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX>, pituitary ACTH could still
          be induced. However, this will require measurement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> by quantitative methods.
        
        
          Lung
          Lung development in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> looked normal as
          viewed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&E</ENAMEX> stained thin sections. The lungs had
          inflated and were indistinguishable between treatments
          and genotypes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Serum Corticosterone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corticosterone</ENAMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> collected from
          untreated control pups or pups from pregnancies where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> was adrenalectomized on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX> had no evident
          correlation to 
          Lifr genotype, as evidenced by the
          trial results from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">serum</NUMEX> collected from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few</NUMEX> pups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pups</ENAMEX> in the control and adrenalectomy groups
          were born by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>section on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX> and the blood collected
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> of birth. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pups in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RU486</NUMEX> group
          were born by natural delivery and were ex utero for
          greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> prior to euthanasia and blood
          collection.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results implicate excess fetal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> response in late
        gestation as the reason for the multi-systemic phenotypes
        in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX>. Maternal adrenalectomy worsens the
        osteopenia, while maternal hormone suppression through
        RU486 improves the presumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> related phenotypes:
        osteopenia, skeletal muscle integrity and glial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. This was an improvement over the poor
        prognosis for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX> described initially
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In that study, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups rarely survived natural
        delivery, but when they did, they were excluded from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litter</ENAMEX> and died at variable times beginning <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX>
        following birth. No pups survived through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>
        following birth. The survival of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups following RU486
        treatment was similar to the phenotype seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNTFR</ENAMEX> null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> where neuronal development was disrupted which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disallowed suckling</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . This indicates that at least
        some of the problems encountered with neuronal development
        that affect normal suckling were not ameliorated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX>.
        Neither adrenalectomy nor RU486 treatment impact the
        apparent well-being of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/- littermates.</ENAMEX> Excess
        GC activity due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss is an unexpected result since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> gain-of<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-function mice</ENAMEX> develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cushing</ENAMEX>'s-like syndrome
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . Thus, if the relationship were simple, loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> function would predict development of GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficiency</ENAMEX>. The observed GC activity excess suggests
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> are integral to GC regulation, but that
        the relationship is complex and that alterations in GC
        response are likely to result from altered balance of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> response cascade induced both by gain and loss of LIFR
        function.
        There is a maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> surge beginning on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX>, where
        E0.5 is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of vaginal plug following mating. A primary
        function of this surge is to allow development to switch
        from growth to maturation of a number of systems that will
        allow the pup to survive on separation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.
        Lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">surfactant synthesis</ENAMEX> and connective tissue maturation
        allow the lungs to become distensible and capable of coping
        with high surface tension. In addition, the maternal GC
        surge effectively leads to fetal glycogen accumulation in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> for energy demands at birth, increased fetal
        bioavailable tri-iodothyronine from thyroxine to allow for
        an increased metabolic rate and thermogenesis required at
        birth, maturation of the fetal small gut to prepare for
        digestion, heightened fetal adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">medullar</ENAMEX> catecholamine
        release for control of the above processes, maturation of
        fetal kidney function and a switch to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
        hematopoiesis from the fetal liver [reviewed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ].
        The timing of this maternal surge suggests that LIFR
        function is required at this point in development as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX> of the consequences of excess GC level.
        Mock adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">surgeries</ENAMEX> were not performed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, we do not know if stress of surgery alone is
        enough to impact well-being in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Progesterone</ENAMEX>
        was administered in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut oil</ENAMEX> following the same regimen
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX>, but resulted in bone loss reminiscent of the
        results following adrenalectomy (unpublished observation).
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut oil</ENAMEX> alone is not responsible for the
        improvements seen in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RU486</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the effect of
        excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> provides further evidence that the LIFR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> can worsen through endocrine manipulation.
        We previously reported that placental integrity is
        disrupted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null maternal-fetal interface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
        . In that study, the maternal response to disorganized
        fetal placental tissue was sufficient to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX>, since there was no detectable disruption
        of fetal erythropoiesis. However, what this meant for
        relative transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> or maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of fetal
        hormone balance upon adrenalectomy is unknown. Maternal
        adrenalectomy on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX> was a naÃ¯ve approach toward blocking
        the maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> surge. It likely had the effect of
        increasing maternal ACTH levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] that would, in turn,
        act on the fetal adrenal to synthesize corticosterone. This
        may have been the source of the modestly elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosterone</ENAMEX> level seen among the 
        Lifr null pups in the adrenalectomy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Although anecdotal, it would appear the RU486
        exposed wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> cleared residual late gestation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosterone</ENAMEX> following birth more effectively than did
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/- littermate.</ENAMEX> Previous studies
        measuring circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels in
        C-section derived E18<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> bore no apparent correlation
        to 
        Lifr genotype (unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>). At the time it appeared that plasma
        measurements in pups immediately following <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>section were
        an unreliable reflection of individual condition and were
        likely to be a reflection of maternal levels. An accurate
        picture of corticosterone levels will probably require
        separation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>.
        RU486 was first explored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> antagonist and
        subsequently found to be both a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>) antagonist, with mild antagonistic effects on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen receptor</ENAMEX>. In certain cases it can function as
        a mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">agonist</ENAMEX>. RU486 can bind to the hormone-binding
        domain of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>. Although still able to localize
        to the nucleus, it prevents subsequent transcription of GC
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone responsive genes</ENAMEX>. It does not directly
        antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineralocorticoid receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>) [reviewed by
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] ].
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX>, along with antagonizing the GR
        antagonizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>, some of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RU486</TIMEX> benefit may be due to
        antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Progesterone</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> to the hormonal milieu. It is processed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>'s
        through the actions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> hydroxylase and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> Î²-hydroxylase
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and it is an anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] and an
        anti-mineralocorticoid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51 52 53</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>
        antagonism by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> could increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX> effects,
        although this is the opposite of the phenotype seen.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Progesterone interacts</ENAMEX> synergistically with estrogen in
        bone remodeling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] , while GC excess is implicated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> is known to be important in the balance
        between bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resorption</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation acting directly
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56 57</NUMEX> ] . Bone loss in the untreated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups suggests a heightened
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> rather than a heightened response to the
        bone-remodeling effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>. Whereas,
        protection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> implies antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> mediated bone
        loss, rather than antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> mediated bone
        remodeling. In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> receptor knockout
        mouse model affects only female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with reported effects
        limited to organs of reproduction causing anovulation,
        uterine hyperplasia and inflammation, limited mammary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and impaired sexual behavior [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . There was
        no noticeable difference in phenotype in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups due to gender following
        any of the treatments (data not shown). Since apparent
        defects due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss arise during the late gestation GC
        surge, while maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> levels are declining in
        anticipation of birth and because phenotypes that have been
        attributed in the literature to GC excess are lessened
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> and the apparent heightened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> response in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> affects both sexes
        equally, it is likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> attenuation of associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> is primarily mediated through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> antagonism.
        However, the interconnectedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> action may also
        include <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">RU486</NUMEX> mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> antagonism as a means of
        impacting the extent of GR-related effects.
        The primary clinical utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> antagonism
        to induce early pregnancy abortion. Since the data were
        collected from pups that were born early by natural
        delivery (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E18.5</NUMEX> versus E19<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.5</NUMEX>) following RU486
        treatment of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, it can be assumed that the
        RU486 used was an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> antagonist, and, by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>, an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> antagonist. The effective dose
        used in this study was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/gram/</ENAMEX>day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>. The dose was not administered by
        weight since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litters</ENAMEX> vary in size and will have a large
        impact on maternal weight in late gestation. 0.3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/gram/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX> has been reported to induce abortion in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early gestation</TIMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> of
        administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . The dosage used in this study was
        able to induce pre-term birth by natural delivery at a time
        when the pups were able to survive ex utero (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E18.5</NUMEX>), but
        was well below the dose used to achieve clinical
        abortion.
        The apparent GC hyper-responsiveness in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null pups
        is probably not directly due to excess circulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosterone</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX>. Instead, expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> and subsequent GR induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> may be more
        relevant than circulating GC level. Another consideration
        is that the benefit of RU486 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> may be either
        central within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPA</ENAMEX> or can be due to peripheral GR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonism</ENAMEX>. Cardiac dysfunction has not yet been explored
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null model. However, many of the defects caused
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp130</TIMEX> loss are shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a null mutation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX>, reflecting the heterodimeric relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> and
        gp130 for functional LIFR:gp130 signaling. A recent cardiac
        muscle specific gp130 knockout model develops normally [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        ] . Whereas, non-tissue specific gp130 knockout results in
        hypotrophic cardiac muscle apparent by E15.5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . This
        suggests that the effect of gp130 knockout on cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is mediated outside of cardiac tissue and the
        primary developmental defect is peripheral to the heart.
        Given the improvement in skeletal muscle noted in this
        study following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX>, it would be reasonable to explore a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central HPA</ENAMEX> defect following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp130</TIMEX> loss as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of
        hypotrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> development.
        Muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX> begins through the muscle precursor
        satellite cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation</ENAMEX> is followed by proliferation
        and fusion with other satellite cells to form new myotubes.
        Muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX> is a dynamic process necessary in the
        maintenance of muscle integrity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNTF</ENAMEX> stimulate
        muscle regeneration in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63</NUMEX> ] , as do other growth
        factors; such as insulin-like growth factor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 65</NUMEX> ] . The
        power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> to regenerate muscle is seen in dystrophin
        null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mdx mice</ENAMEX>, where exogenous LIF regenerates atrophied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diaphragm</ENAMEX> muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . LIF induced signaling appears to
        be essential in muscle development as seen by muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atrophy</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E18.5</ENAMEX>. In the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX>, muscle atrophy may be caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> induced alteration
        of metabolism, which leads to glycogen accumulation,
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and stimulation of protein
        degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67 68</NUMEX> ] . Because low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU486</ENAMEX> can
        fully protect 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> fetal muscle from the late
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation GC</ENAMEX> surge, the balance between hormone function
        and muscle integrity appears both delicate and direct.
        GR expression is specific but widespread within neuronal
        and glial cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> is also responsible for
        increased GFAP expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] , while signaling through
        LIFR:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp130</ENAMEX> is critical in fostering the differentiation of
        neuronal precursors into astrocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] mediated through
        STAT3 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72 73 74</NUMEX> ] . Glial cells respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, which,
        in turn, can affect transcriptional control of GFAP level
        either positively or negatively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] . The present study
        shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>'s can play a critical role in hindering
        astrocyte development in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> as seen
        through the partial abrogation of this defect following
        exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">RU486</NUMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. RU486 crosses the
        blood-brain-barrier and is present at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 28%</NUMEX> of levels
        seen in the serum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] . Perhaps glial development would
        be further improved in the presence of higher levels of
        RU486 were these levels not abortive. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The RU486</TIMEX> effect is
        not likely to be mediated through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> astrocyte precursors, since
        astrocytes have low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>'s that are only detectable
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] .
        The vigor displayed at birth by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU486</ENAMEX> treated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lifr -/-</ENAMEX> pups is striking and
        suggests sweeping improvement in well-being. Pups of all 
        Lifr genotypes are able to breathe
        well at birth and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifr</ENAMEX> +/+ and +/- pups thrive with no
        apparent lung handicap. This indicates that the improvement
        due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> is implemented through modest alteration in GC
        regulation since complete loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> function leads to
        incomplete lung development at birth and impaired survival
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">atelectasis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] . The neural compartment may
        have been under-protected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> due to partial exclusion
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain-barrier, while bone and skeletal muscle,
        tissues exposed to higher levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX>, were clearly
        protected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothalamus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anterior pituitary</ENAMEX> are also
        protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain-barrier. Elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> in
        response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> was apparent. Consequently, very low
        levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> appear to mediate partial neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX>. Loss of neuronal subpopulations integral to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suckling</ENAMEX> need to be explored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RU486</TIMEX> late gestation
        pups, but the data suggest that the health of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is not directly influenced by altered GC
        response.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, many of the multi-systemic defects during
        late gestation brought about by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> loss were attenuated
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal</ENAMEX> RU486 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteopenia</ENAMEX> is reduced,
        muscle integrity is normal and glial cells are forming. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> can no longer detect abnormalities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFR</ENAMEX> null
        pups severe enough to stimulate culling behavior. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neuron deficit appears functionally unaffected and
        the newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> still succumb through inability to suckle.
        These results indicate that signaling through LIFR
        utilizing the LIFR:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp130</NUMEX> heterodimer is essential for an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appropriate GC</ENAMEX> response during development.
