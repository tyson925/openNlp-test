        Nerve growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (NGF), a prototypical neurotrophic
        factor and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the neurotrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, promotes a
        wide range of responses in its target cells. These range
        from neuronal differentiation, maintenance of survival, and
        regulation of metabolic activities [for review see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        ] . Many of these actions include and require
        transcriptional regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, the greater
        part of the changes in gene expression that underlie the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> response remain to be elucidated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PC12</ENAMEX> line of rat
        pheochromocytoma cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] has proved to be a
        particularly favorable system for detecting NGF-responsive
        changes in gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . These cells
        resemble sympathico-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pheochromo</NUMEX>-blasts and upon exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> cease proliferation and acquire, in a transcription
        dependent mechanism, many of the properties of post-mitotic
        sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> including neurite outgrowth and
        electrical excitability. The robust nature of the response
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> coupled with their capacity to be
        examined both before and at various times after exposure to
        the factor has greatly facilitated study of the NGF
        mechanism of action, including gene regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        To obtain a comprehensive and quantitative over-view of
        NGF-promoted gene regulation, we [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] have used SAGE
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serial Analysis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Expression</ENAMEX>). In this technique [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] cellular transcripts are converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>
        "tags" which are sequenced, quantified and, in many cases,
        matched with known genes. By comparing SAGE profiles for
        cells in different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (as for example before and after
        exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>), it is thus possible to obtain a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> view of gene expression and regulation.
        Moreover, if a sufficient number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE tags</ENAMEX> are analyzed,
        changes in expression levels of individual transcripts can
        be associated with a high level of statistical significance
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Initial analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 157,000</NUMEX> SAGE tags from
        PC12 cells cultured without or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 days</TIMEX> revealed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 800</NUMEX> transcripts (of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 21,000</NUMEX>) that
        are regulated by Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold or greater in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX> were assignable to named
        genes of known functions that regulate cellular behaviors
        ranging from actin and microtubule cytoskeleton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly/disassembly</ENAMEX>, gene transcription, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing,
        neurotransmission, and energetics. A variety of criteria
        supported the reliability of the quantitative findings
        revealed by our SAGE analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        In the present study, we have extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our SAGE</TIMEX>
        profiling of naÃ¯ve and long-term NGF-treated PC12 cells to
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163,000</NUMEX> tags representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 22,000</NUMEX> unique
        transcripts. Analysis of these reveals the presence of
        transcripts encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> (RPs).
        Surprisingly, we find that long-term NGF exposure leads to
        statistically significant changes in relative abundance of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of these transcripts by factors of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5</NUMEX>-fold. In addition, a time course for one of the RP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> (encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L9</ENAMEX>) reveals that its relative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> begins to change within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hr</TIMEX> and is maximally
        regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> hr of NGF exposure.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were generated and analyzed as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] from matched sets of PC12
          cells before and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 days</TIMEX> of exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>. The
          present analysis is based on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">76,280 15-mer</NUMEX> tags from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NGF-untreated PC12 cells</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87,004</NUMEX> tags from NGF-treated
          cells (after exclusion of duplicate ditags, mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> and repetitive elements). Consideration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tags</ENAMEX> observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> or more between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          indicated the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 22,000</NUMEX> unique
          transcripts. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> were regulated
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX>-fold in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> and approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold or more.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detection</ENAMEX> and quantification of transcripts
          encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
          Transcripts represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> tags were identified
          by direct matches of tags with the appropriate sequences
          of known rat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>) or through
          matches of tags with appropriate sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> ESTs
          (present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI Unigene</ENAMEX>) that were in turn found to
          overlap with known rat genes. Positive identification
          required that the transcript or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> have a poly
          adenylation signal and poly A tail, and that the tag
          followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the most 3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CATG</ENAMEX> of the transcript. In this way
          74 tags were unambiguously assignable to known rat
          transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> described as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. Available sequences <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">encoding rat ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins L15</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S8</ENAMEX> do not contain a CATG sequence and
          hence SAGE tags for these could not be identified. In
          addition, rat sequence data for transcripts encoding RPs
          L2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L25</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L33 and S1</TIMEX> are not presently available in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unigene</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the tags in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> corresponding
          to transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> along with their
          relative abundances. Considering that the eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosome</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, our analysis
          includes transcripts encoding a major proportion of the
          known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Relative expression of transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          Among the information provided by analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is the relative abundances of transcripts. The data
          given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Figure 1show</ENAMEX> the relative abundances
          of transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PC12 cell ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> with
          respect to one another as well as with respect to the
          total cell complement of transcripts. As noted above, our
          analysis has detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 22,000</NUMEX> unique transcripts
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> transcripts
          identified here thus account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 0.33%</NUMEX> of
          this total. By contrast, for NGF-untreated and -treated
          PC12 cells, tags corresponding to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> identified RP
          transcripts represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2% and 3.5%</NUMEX>, respectively, of
          total tags analyzed. As anticipated, this clearly places
          transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> as a whole in the high
          abundance category.
          The most abundantly expressed ribosomal transcripts in
          NGF-untreated PC12 cells included those encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins S15</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S24 and L41</TIMEX>. These each accounted
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.35%</NUMEX> of total cell transcripts.
          The high relative abundance of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          transcripts in NGF-untreated cells can be appreciated by
          the observation that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> tags encountered more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> times in our analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S15 and S24</TIMEX>) encoded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>; moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcripts represented
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> tags encountered from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> times and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> tags encountered from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-100</NUMEX> times.
          The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Figure 1show</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment
          resulted in an overall decrease in relative abundance of
          transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2% to 3.5%</NUMEX> of total).
          This may reflect in part our observation that NGF
          treatment increases the numbers of transcripts
          representing low-abundance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless,
          transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> remained among the
          most highly expressed in the NGF-treated cells. For
          instance, tags for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L13A</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L31</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L37A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S24 and S29</TIMEX> had
          relative abundances of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> or more. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abundantly</ENAMEX> expressed tags in NGF-treated cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          represent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal transcripts</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          NGF selectively regulates the expression of
          transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
          In addition to yielding an overall decrease in the
          abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcripts relative to total cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment also promoted
          selective changes in relative expression of transcripts
          encoding individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Monte-Carlo simulation analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> data
          indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> RP
          transcripts underwent changes that were significant at
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.01</NUMEX> level (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> transcripts, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/3</NUMEX> were down-regulated in response
          to NGF.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the distribution of fold-changes in
          transcript levels in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> RP
          transcripts were either invariant or showed changes of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or less; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> individual transcripts decreased by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5</ENAMEX> fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L12, L18, L24, L28, L30, S15, S16, S18, S19 and</ENAMEX>
          S24) and one was elevated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX>-fold (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L17</NUMEX>).
          In a past study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , the differences in
          NGF-promoted gene expression revealed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> analysis of
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were found to be highly reliable based on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the absence of regulation shown by a number of
          anticipated "housekeeping" genes including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          the observation that the vast majority of transcripts
          were not responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the detection of
          anticipated changes in expression of a number transcripts
          previously reported to be NGF responsive, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) the
          agreement in relative expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as revealed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> and northern blot analyses. To further confirm
          the reliability of our SAGE findings, we used real time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative PCR</ENAMEX> to compare levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> different RP
          transcripts in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PC12 cells</ENAMEX> treated with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-12 days</TIMEX>. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, both techniques revealed
          similar changes in expression.
        
        
          Rapid regulation of an RP transcript by NGF
          We next determined the time course with which NGF
          regulates an RP transcript. For this purpose, we studied
          RP L9 which undergoes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-fold elevation in response to
          long-term NGF treatment. Because the changes in
          expression are relatively small, we used real time PCR
          for this end. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, the relative
          abundance of transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L9</ENAMEX> were
          significantly upregulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) whereas there was no significant change
          in transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S29</ENAMEX>, which does not undergo
          long-term NGF regulation. A time course (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>)
          revealed that elevation of L9 transcripts reaches maximal
          levels within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 hrs</NUMEX> of NGF exposure.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> regulates expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcripts
          In the present work, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE profiling</ENAMEX> to
          identify and quantify the relative numbers of transcripts
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> PC12 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> before and
          after long-term exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>. This has permitted us to
          detect selective changes in transcripts encoding specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX>.
          A number of criteria support the reliability of our
          findings. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> regards the assignment of SAGE tags
          to specific RP transcripts. We required that all matching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> or transcripts have clearly definable poly A tails
          and poly adenylation signals. Due to the extensive data
          base for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> RP transcripts, it was possible to make all
          matches with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat sequences</ENAMEX>. In addition, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CATG +11</NUMEX>) base SAGE tags for our analysis; we have
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] that this leads to a significantly more
          reliable matching of SAGE tags to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than with the
          often-used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-mer tags. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> indicator of reliability
          stems from prior analysis of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">SAGE libraries</ENAMEX> and data
          obtained from them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . For instance, we have shown
          that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">SAGE libraries</ENAMEX> show little or no NGF-promoted
          changes in tag numbers for transcripts encoding a number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housekeeping proteins</ENAMEX>. Moreover, a number of
          transcripts previously found by alternative technologies
          to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment, showed similar changes in
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SAGE profiling</ENAMEX> study. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verified SAGE-</ENAMEX>predicted responses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> transcripts
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> criterion for reliability was
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monte Carlo simulation</ENAMEX> indicated that many of the
          NGF-promoted responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcripts were at a
          probability of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. Because of the
          relatively high abundance of many RP transcripts, even
          comparably small changes in expression could be detected
          at this level of significance. A last criterion was that
          we used real time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> to verify effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          RP transcripts.
          A previous study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , based on
          comparison of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7,000</NUMEX> random ESTs
          from naÃ¯ve and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NGF-</ENAMEX>treated PC12 cells, reported an
          NGF-promoted increase in expression of RPL7 transcripts
          and a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPL19</TIMEX> transcripts. This contrasts with
          the current data which revealed no significant change in
          expression of either of these transcripts. The reason for
          this discrepancy is unclear, but could in part originate
          from the relatively small number of transcripts that were
          surveyed in the former study. To our knowledge, there are
          currently no other reports regarding effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> on
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal transcripts</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Relative levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcripts
          Our observations indicate that there is a wide range
          in the numbers transcripts per cell that encode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual RPs</ENAMEX>. For instance, both before and after NGF
          treatment, there was over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> difference in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">relative</ENAMEX> numbers of transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L7</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L22</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S21</TIMEX> as
          compared to those encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S29</ENAMEX>. Because of the general
          scarcity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisera</ENAMEX> prepared against mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX>, we
          do not know whether this is reflected at the protein
          level. However, for a number of other NGF-regulated
          transcripts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells, there is a good correlation
          between relative levels of message and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 16 17</NUMEX>
          ] . Thus, it may be that although levels of individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> are assumed to be similar to one another, some may be
          present in limiting numbers. Alternatively, there may be
          a considerable disparity between relative abundances of
          RP transcripts and their corresponding proteins
          A recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> study of targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc in a human
          neuroblastoma cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , reported relative
          abundances for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> RP transcripts. The existence of such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> permit us to compare the relative levels of RP
          transcripts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types (neuroblastoma and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pheochromocytoma</ENAMEX>) of related origin (i.e.,
          neural-crest-derived) that both have the potential for
          neuronal differentiation. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> RP transcripts detected
          here represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2%</NUMEX> of the total transcripts in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NGF-untreated PC12 cells</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> treatment. By
          contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> reported in the neuroblastoma study
          accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1%</NUMEX> of total transcripts for cells without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc over-expression and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6%</NUMEX> for such cells
          transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc. Thus, for non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc transfected
          neuroblastoma cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PC12 cells (Â± NGF</ENAMEX>) the
          contribution of total RP transcripts lies in a similar
          range and this parameter is greatly elevated in
          neuroblastoma cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc over-expression. With
          respect to transcripts for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>'s, there are
          many similarities as well as several striking differences
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>-untreated PC12 cells
          are compared with non-transfected neuroblastoma cells, of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> RP transcripts detected in common for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>) have relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundances</ENAMEX> within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> transcripts are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX>-fold higher in relative abundance in PC12
          cells. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these cases (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S9 and S17</TIMEX>) no tags were
          detected in the non-transformed neuroblastoma cells; in
          several other cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S12, S24, L24</ENAMEX>) the relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells was over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-fold that in the
          neuroblastoma cells. For most of these, expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc elevated the neuroblastoma levels to relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundances</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold of those in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells. However,
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L24 and S24</TIMEX>, the relative abundance in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc</NUMEX>-expressing neuroblastoma cells was still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/3</NUMEX> that
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells. Finally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> RP transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L7, L11, L21,</ENAMEX>
          L30, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S7</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S8 and P2</TIMEX>) were of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> times lower abundance in
          PC12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> than in neuroblastoma cells and this
          difference was appreciably enhanced when the NB cells
          were transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc.
          We have also compared our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> results with those for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> carried out with pooled human adult brain (tissue
          supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory J. Riggins</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/sage/sagerec.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cgi</ENAMEX>?<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rec=161</ENAMEX>).
          Comparison with data for NGF-treated cells reveals
          similarity in relative abundance within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> RP transcripts in common between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> to within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. However,
          several large differences do occur. For example the
          relative abundances of transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L9</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L39</TIMEX>,
          S24, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S13</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S17</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-10-fold</NUMEX> higher in NGF-treated
          PC12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> than in the pooled brain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
          transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L28</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold lower. These
          observations reinforce the notion that expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual RP</ENAMEX> transcripts can be significantly variable
          from cell type to cell type as well as sensitive to
          extrinsic signals.
        
        
          Potential significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcript
          regulation
          Although the ribosome has been considered as a
          "molecular machine" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , it is of interest that the
          transcripts encoding individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of this
          organelle are subject to regulation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> related
          questions emerge regarding these findings: how do these
          changes compare with previous reports for regulation of
          RP transcripts and what might be the functional
          consequences of these changes?
          A number of studies have employed a variety of
          techniques to detect changes in gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the oncogenic state and have reported
          selective elevation of specific RP transcripts in tumors.
          Examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L7a</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L37 and S14</TIMEX> in prostate tumors
          and cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L5</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L7A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L18</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S8</TIMEX>,
          S12, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S28</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0 and P1</TIMEX> in colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> and cell
          lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L5</ENAMEX> in astrocytomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ;
          L18a in squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L19</ENAMEX> in breast
          tumors that over-express erbB-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S3A</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S4</TIMEX>, and
          S17 in lymphoid malignancies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L38</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX>, and P1
          in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>,
          L5, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L9</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L35</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L39</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S3A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S10</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S17</ENAMEX> in liver tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] . In addition, as noted above, a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> study
          identified targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-myc in a human neuroblastoma cell
          line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> up-regulated genes detected, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded RPs</ENAMEX> with elevations ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37-fold</NUMEX>.
          Several of these genes were also up-regulated by c-myc.
          Taken together, these findings indicate that the
          transition to the transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is associated with
          elevation of various RP transcripts. A potential
          interpretation of such observations is that this
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation reflects the enhanced rate of cell division
          in tumor cells and the requirement for greater levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. In agreement with this possibility,
          transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S7</ENAMEX> are reported to be
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated in regenerating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . However, for
          the study involving responses of neuroblastoma cells to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-Myc</ENAMEX>, despite the massive up-regulation of RP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, there was no over-all increase in the rate
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          Before considering potential functional consequences
          of the changes in RP expression described here as well as
          elsewhere, it must be conceded that changes in transcript
          abundance may not necessarily lead to changes in protein
          expression. The present lack of available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antibodies/antiserum</ENAMEX> to most mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> hampers such a
          determination. However, even if cases occur in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">altered RP</ENAMEX> transcript expression does not lead to changes
          in expression of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, our and
          others' findings regarding selective regulation of RP
          transcripts would then raise the interesting issue as to
          why, and the mechanism by which, transcript and protein
          expression are uncoupled.
          If at least some of the NGF-promoted alterations in RP
          transcript abundance lead to changes in expression of the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, what might be the functional
          consequences? In the present system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> converts
          proliferating PC12 cells to a non-proliferating
          neuronally differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Our findings reveal that
          the relative overall abundance of transcripts for RP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> fell by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/3</NUMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>. In addition,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the individual RP transcripts detected
          showed significant changes in expression and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2/3</NUMEX> of these were decreases. This overall
          decrease in NGF-promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> transcript expression and the
          preponderance of decreases in expression of specific RP
          transcripts compared to increases would favor the
          interpretation that the changes observed here reflect, at
          least in part, the transition to the non-dividing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, we observed that many of
          the RP transcripts did not show significant responses to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> and that a number showed increases in expression.
          This suggests that the situation is likely to be more
          complex with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> perhaps playing specific
          roles not simply associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proliferative</ENAMEX> capacity. In agreement with this, we found
          no significant change in expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S29</ENAMEX> transcripts
          even though these have been reported to be present at low
          levels in growth phase cells and elevated in quiescent
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          In addition to leaving the cell cycle, NGF-treated
          PC12 cells undergo neuronal differentiation. This raises
          the possibility that some of the observed changes, as for
          many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> regulated genes, is related to acquisition
          of the neuronal phenotype. An analysis of gene regulation
          in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NTERA2 cells induced</ENAMEX> to leave the cell cycle and
          neuronally differentiate in response to retinoic acid
          revealed decreases in RP transcripts including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L7</TIMEX>,
          L8, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L10, L13, L39, S2, S6, S13, S16, S20, S19, S23,</ENAMEX> S27A
          and P0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Of these, In the present study only RP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transcripts L8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S6</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S16</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S19</TIMEX> showed significant down
          regulation in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> whereas the others found in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NTERA2</NUMEX> study either did not show changes that were
          significant at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ .01</NUMEX> level or underwent a
          significant increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S27A</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curcic et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          reported that differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BC3H1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myocytes</ENAMEX> is
          accompanied by a drop in L32 gene transcription; in
          contrast, we found no significant change in transcripts
          encoding this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>. In another study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L35a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S5</ENAMEX> were
          down regulated during murine erythryolukemia cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] ; we also observed decreases in
          these transcripts. Mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S19</ENAMEX> is associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> and therefore appears to play a
          selective role in differentiation/proliferation of
          erythropoetic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> resulted in a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5</NUMEX>-fold drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S19</TIMEX> transcripts. Thus, although
          changes in expression of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RP genes</ENAMEX> may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with differentiation, the pattern of such
          changes may reflect the particular cell type and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> stimulus that is involved.
          Another condition associated with changes in RP
          expression is apoptotic death. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RP L4/L1 transcripts,</ENAMEX>
          which were not significantly affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>, are
          selectively upregulated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> aza
          cytosine-induced death and over-expression of this gene
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells induces apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over</NUMEX>-expression
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L7</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L13A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S29</TIMEX> have been also reported to induce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> promoted
          little if any change in expression of these RP
          transcripts. Thus, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> is an effective
          anti-apoptotic factor, these actions do not appear to be
          mediated by down-regulation of potentially death-inducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX>.
          At present, in contrast to studies on bacterial and
          archael ribosomes, relatively little is known about the
          functions of individual mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> ( [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . However, assuming that changes in message
          abundance lead to alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels, it is
          reasonable to anticipate that the NGF-promoted effects
          observed here may affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> synthetic capacity
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in some manner. Such changes are unlikely to
          be global; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> does affect the cellular rate of protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, but this seems to be due at least in part to
          post-translational modification of the translational
          machinery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The alternative is that the changes
          reported here may result in selective effects on
          translation of specific messages.
          A final, and important possibility to consider is that
          a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> appear to possess extraribosomal
          functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and consequently that the changes
          reported here may lead to responses that do not directly
          relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> function. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L18</ENAMEX>, which
          was significantly down-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>, has been
          reported to negatively regulate double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dsRNA</NUMEX>)-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (PKR) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . As an
          additional example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S19</ENAMEX>, which is also down-regulated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>, has been implicated in erythropoiesis and has
          also been described as a monocyte chemotactic factor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          ] . As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> RP L9 which we found to be
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> starting within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> and
          maximally by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> hrs, has been shown to be the ortholog of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast gene</ENAMEX> 
          grc5 which appears to be involved
          in multiple cellular functions including growth control,
          cytoskeleton control and energy metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] .
          Identification of NGF-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> should now facilitate
          exploration of their potential roles in the responses of
          cells to neurotrophins.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> analysis provides a reliable, quantitative
        picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells
        before and after long term exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> are among the most
        abundant transcripts in the cells; however there is a wide
        range between numbers of transcripts for individual RP
        transcripts.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. NGF promotes an overall decrease in relative RP
        transcript expression (for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> RP transcripts detected,
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> of total transcripts to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX>). This
        drop represents a decrease in relative expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual RP</ENAMEX> transcripts as well as an increase in message
        complexity in NGF-treated cells.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Long term NGF treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells promotes
        statistically significant changes in expression of over
        half of the transcripts encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Decreases in expression outnumbered increases by a ratio of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. The largest observed changes in
        expression are in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5</ENAMEX> fold.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> RP transcript (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RPL9</NUMEX>) the response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> is rapid; an elevation is detected within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 hr</NUMEX> of NGF
        exposure and reaches maximum regulation by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> hrs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Examination of the literature reveals many other
        reports in which expression of individual or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of RP
        transcripts are regulated in response to growth factors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> or malignant transformation.
        Comparison with the present data indicate that changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> transcripts is regulated in a cell and
        state dependent fashion with a large diversity in the
        particular RP transcripts that are subject to regulation.
        Thus, although the ribosome may be regarded as a "machine"
        there is a good deal of potential for plasticity with
        respect to the expression of its various components. This
        raises the possibilities that growth factors and other cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> may affect ribosomal function, and thereby the
        capacity of cells to transcribe specific transcripts.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. In the absence of information about the specific
        functions of most individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells, one
        can only speculate at present on the physiologic
        significance of the reported changes. However, it seems
        highly plausible that the observed responses may play roles
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>-promoted neuronal differentiation. This may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> in part by selective effects on translation of
        certain messages. In addition, past findings support the
        possibility that at least some of the regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPs</ENAMEX> have
        extra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> actions that may affect neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and function.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> and matching SAGE tags with RP
          transcripts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were prepared from naÃ¯ve and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-day</TIMEX>
          NGF-treated PC12 cells and sequenced as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . To match SAGE tags with RP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, tags were initially analyzed with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI) rat

          matches possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-mer tags with known rat genes and
          expressed sequence tags (ESTs). With the use of sequences

          matches were further scrutinized to determine whether
          there was a match at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">15th</NUMEX> base and to determine
          whether the matched sequence was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the most 3</TIMEX>' end of a
          known rat transcript or EST. We considered only cases in
          which a clear poly(A) tail and a polyadenylation signal
          were present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the transcript or EST.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriate ESTs</ENAMEX> were further analyzed by an advanced
          BLAST search for matches with known <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> RP genes.
          Monte-Carlo simulation analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> data was
          carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAGE 300</ENAMEX> software package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
