        Squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck is
        diagnosed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, resulting in
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> deaths [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Carcinomas of the head
        and neck are often associated with multiple areas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX> or carcinoma 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (CIS) in noncontiguous
        mucosa, as well as with the development of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> of the aerodigestive tract. The concept of "field
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cancerization</ENAMEX>" hypothesizes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the mucosal
        epithelium, although normal in appearance, are
        "preconditioned" by chronic exposure to carcinogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, thus priming them for the subsequent development of
        invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The use of modern molecular biological techniques has
        supported and greatly expanded our understanding of the
        "cancer field effect". Analysis of X-chromosome
        inactivation in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> shows that distinct tumors arise from regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clonal</ENAMEX> growths of phenotypically normal, mutated
        preneoplastic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , a phenomenon similar to
        that also observed in liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cirrhosis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Long-term smoking and alcohol abuse are strongly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with these clonal growths in the upper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerodigestive</ENAMEX> tract (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ).
        Frequent allelic loss at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">chromosomal</NUMEX> locations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>,
        4q, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14q and 17q</TIMEX> is observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Molecular studies
        of hyperplastic, dysplastic, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIS</ENAMEX>, and invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neck lesions</ENAMEX> indicate that loss of heterozygosity at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chromosomal</ENAMEX> locations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p and 17p</TIMEX> are early events in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck carcinogenesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 12</ENAMEX> ] . Specific tumor
        suppressor genes, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHIT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3p14.2</NUMEX>) 
        p16 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9p21</NUMEX>), 
        p53 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17p13.1</NUMEX>) and 
        RB1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13q14.2</NUMEX>) have also been shown to
        be mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 13</ENAMEX> ] . Nevertheless,
        the large number of additional chromosomal regions with
        high frequencies of allelic loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck cancer
        strongly suggests that many suppressor genes still remain
        to be identified.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mannose 6-phosphate/</ENAMEX>insulin-like growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor 2</ENAMEX> receptor (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX>) maps to chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6q25-27</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ; a chromosomal region predicted to
        contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        It encodes for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> that functions in intracellular
        lysosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> trafficking, transforming growth factor
        beta activation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF2</ENAMEX> degradation (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granzyme</ENAMEX> B internalization by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is also
        required for cytotoxic T cells to induce apoptosis in cells
        targeted for death, resulting in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> being
        referred to as a "death receptor" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Elevated IGF2
        levels during murine development arising from M6P/IGF2R
        deficiency result in cardiac abnormalities, cleft palate,
        fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> syndrome frequently observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cloned animals</ENAMEX> is associated with epigenetic changes in
        gene regulation and decreased 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> plays a crucial role in
        regulating mammalian fetal growth and development.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is also mechanistically
        involved in the genesis of human cancer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX>
        ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        coupled with intragenic loss-of-function mutations in the
        remaining allele is a common event in human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Inheritance of a tandem repeat polymorphism in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> furthermore predicts for
        enhanced susceptibility to oral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Moreover,
        tumor cell growth is inhibited when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> expression is restored to
        normal while it is increased when gene expression is
        reduced [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . The results of these mutational
        and functional studies clearly demonstrate that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> possesses the
        characteristics necessary to be classified as a tumor
        suppressor gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        We tested in this investigation the hypothesis that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity in
        locally advanced, non-metastatic squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinomas
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck is associated with poorer patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> used in this study were enrolled in
        a randomized trial of twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> radiotherapy with or
        without concurrent chemotherapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . We report herein
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        occurs frequently in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and that it
        predicts for poor therapeutic outcome.

          have been previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . The exons
          containing these polymorphisms were PCR amplified from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> conditions identical to those

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
          frequency is independent of the polymorphism used for its

          Taq <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> can introduce
          sequence errors during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification, and unequal
          amplification of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> can result in false
          positive detection of loss of heterozygosity. Thus, both
          the normal and tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX> were amplified in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions, and assessed for tumor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity.
          Due to the potential of contaminating the tumor tissue
          sample with normal stroma, allele loss in informative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was defined as a ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> decrease in the ratio
          of the polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> intensities in the tumor tissue
          versus that in the surrounding normal stromal tissue;
          this was quantified using a densitometer.

          The median follow-up for surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled
          on this trial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] is now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76 months</TIMEX> (range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 128</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
          was associated with significant reductions in 5 year
          relapse-free survival {<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% to 54%</NUMEX>) vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>

          Since the clinical trial demonstrated a significant
          benefit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving radiotherapy and
          concurrent chemotherapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , outcome was also

          those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>, non <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These results indicate
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss results in
          poor patient outcome when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> alone is employed since all

          had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 year</TIMEX> relapse-free survival, locoregional control
          and cause specific survival that were statistically
          indistinguishable from those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX>, non <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.2</NUMEX>). Combined modality therapy also did not provide
          any significant benefit over radiation alone for patients
          with a non-mutated tumor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.2</NUMEX>). Thus,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a non-mutated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> who received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> alone had

          ] . This implies that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss may help to
          identify a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who can

          The development of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> primaries was independent of

        Discussion
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        occurs frequently in human breast, liver and lung cancer [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] , and the remaining allele of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 to 50%</NUMEX> of
        these tumors contains an intragenic loss-of-function point
        mutation in the ligand binding domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is also commonly mutated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> and endometrial malignancies because its
        coding sequence contains a poly-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> region that is a
        mutational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> in tumors with mismatch repair
        deficiencies and microsatellite instability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Functional studies show that the introduction of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exogenous</ENAMEX> wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> into human colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells with a single inactivated allele significantly
        decreases growth rate and enhances apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Conversely, loss of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> expression promotes cancer
        cell growth by increasing intracellular signaling from both
        the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        We demonstrate herein that loss of heterozygosity at the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> locus in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is also associated with poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> prognosis. Loss
        of heterozygosity in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> can occur either because of
        chromosomal deletion or somatic recombination resulting in
        uniparental disomy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Comparative genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 38</NUMEX> ]
        demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6q</ENAMEX> deletion frequency (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) is
        similar to that which we observed at the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R locus.</ENAMEX> This provides
        evidence that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is due primarily to either gene
        deletion or chromosomal loss rather than somatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>.
        Since chromosomal deletion can affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        alone does not rule out the possibility that other adjacent
        genes also have a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
        neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. However, our previous finding, that both
        alleles of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> are mutated in greater than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinomas of the lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ,
        supports our postulate that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene at chromosome location <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6q</TIMEX>.
        The clinical trial from which the tumor specimens used
        in this study were derived showed improvements in
        relapse-free survival, locoregional control, and overall
        survival for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized to combined modality
        therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . This investigation established that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose tumors had 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity and
        were treated with radiotherapy alone had a significantly
        worse prognosis than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> with a non-mutated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>. Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an intact 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> had a similar prognosis
        whether they received radiotherapy alone or combined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">modality</ENAMEX> treatment. Thus, our findings suggest that head
        and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with tumor 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        would benefit most from combined modality treatment.
        The mechanism by which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
        neck tumors increases the effectiveness of adjuvant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> is presently unknown, but it is clearly of
        clinical importance. A primary function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in
        placental mammals involves the degradation of extracellular
        IGF2. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss would
        therefore result in enhanced cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bioavailability</ENAMEX> of
        this potent growth factor, thereby potentially increasing
        both cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        . The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> also facilitates the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>, a
        potent cell growth inhibitor that is secreted in an
        inactive form (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] ). 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> mutation is therefore one
        mechanism by which cancer cells can become refractory to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>'s mitoinhibitory effect.
        We have previously shown that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> mutation in squamous cell
        carcinoma of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is highly correlated with increased
        TGFβ concentrations in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and patient plasma [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elevated TGFβ</ENAMEX> in the latter stages of tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> directly contributes to enhanced tumor
        angiogenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastasis</ENAMEX> formation and a decreased host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ). Together these
        findings predict that tumors with a mutated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> would be more resistant to
        therapy than those with an intact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Moreover, if
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemotherapeutic agents</ENAMEX> are not only directly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxic</ENAMEX> to cancer cells, but also reduce tumor production
        of growth factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>, adjuvant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> would be more useful in treating tumors with a
        mutated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> , as observed in this
        study.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is normally imprinted in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with only the maternal copy of the gene being
        expressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, both copies of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> are expressed in humans
        because genomic imprinting at this locus was lost in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">primate</ENAMEX> lineage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 75 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, restoration of biallelic 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> results
        in a marked reduction in offspring weight late in embryonic
        development that persists into adulthood [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . This
        demonstrates that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss or haploid
        insufficiency markedly enhances cell proliferation and/or
        survival during fetal development. Therefore, mutation of
        even a single allele of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatic cells</ENAMEX> is
        predicted to also promote cell growth.
        Haploid insufficiency for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes, such
        as 
        Nf2 , 
        p27 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, 
        p53 , 
        Ptch , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> , is known to promote tumor
        formation (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] ). Yamada 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] demonstrated that in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> chronically infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C viruses, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> is mutated not only in
        hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), but also in the
        phenotypically normal hepatocytes adjacent to these tumors.
        Interestingly, only one 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allele is inactivated in
        the adjacent cirrhotic tissue even when both alleles are
        mutated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCC</ENAMEX>. These findings are consistent with
        normal appearing, preneoplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> forming clonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> haploid insufficiency
        affords them with a selective growth and/or survival
        advantage relative to normal hepatocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is not the only organ in which regions of
        normal appearing tissue have a clonal origin. Entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lobules</ENAMEX> and large ducts of normal breast tissue can be
        derived from a single progenitor cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at
        various chromosomal locations is frequently detectable in
        morphologically normal lobules adjacent to breast tumors [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> ] . Lung tumors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck tumors that develop in
        a localized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also often have a common clonal origin [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 49</NUMEX> ] . The high frequency of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity
        observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck tumors in this study suggests
        that the phenomenon of "field cancerization", first
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slaughter</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>,
        may in part result from the clonal proliferation of mucosal
        epithelial cells with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> allelic loss.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The observations in this study raise the intriguing
        possibility that selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        for concurrent chemotherapy can be based upon the
        intratumoral mutational status of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R .</ENAMEX> Furthermore, since 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M6P/IGF2R</ENAMEX> loss of heterozygosity in
        squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinomas</ENAMEX> is highly correlated with an
        elevated plasma TGFβ level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> prognosis may
        potentially be assessed by a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> test. This would
        be desirable since the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> of combined modality
        therapy is greater than that of radiotherapy alone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX>
        ] .
