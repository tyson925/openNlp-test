        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Prostate cancer</ENAMEX> (PCA) is the leading cause of death in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 55</TIMEX>, according to recent data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . To date, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of
        this disease, including how normal prostate cells become
        neoplastic, remain unidentified. Moreover, the treatment
        efficacy of this <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains limited, especially when
        it recurs. A thorough understanding of the neoplastic
        process could facilitate earlier detection of the disease,
        lead to more specific therapies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, and ultimately
        improve survival.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> is one of several types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> has
        been found or is thought to play a pathophysiological role.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-6</ENAMEX> may play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> because
        of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> does in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> of cancer biology.
        For example, early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> observed that transfection
        of untransformed B cells with a plasmid for constitutive
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> conferred the tumorigenic phenotype on
        the cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is a key factor in myeloma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and survival [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , and also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaposi</ENAMEX>'s
        sarcoma, a solid tumor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In myeloma, the standard
        therapy for treatment includes prednisone, which acts by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibiting IL-6</ENAMEX> synthesis. Experimental anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> therapies
        for myeloma and B-lymphoproliferative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> have been
        shown to be of some use in limited clinical trials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11</NUMEX> ] , therefore this is an intensely-studied target
        for myeloma therapy.
        As mentioned above, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is a cytokine that functions as
        a necessary growth factor in several cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, most
        studied in multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myeloma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . It is an essential
        factor in the development and maintenance of B cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplasms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and likely plays an important role in
        many other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> signals through a set of
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT kinases</ENAMEX> are activated by
        phosphorylation initiated by the homodimerization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6/IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> on the cell surface. The major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> signaling intermediates are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Homodimerization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6/receptor</ENAMEX> complex induces the
        autophosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JAK2</TIMEX>. The now-activated JAK2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX>, which forms homodimers, can cross the
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> and function as a transcription factor,
        inducing various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in the
        cellular transformation process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        An association between autocrine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> has been
        known for some time [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . The change in prostate cell
        phenotype from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paracrine IL-6</ENAMEX>-stimulated to autocrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-stimulated is believed to be a contributing factor in
        the progression from benign hyperplasia to neoplasia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is also implicated in the development of cancer cell
        resistance to chemotherapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . In
        other studies, a chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> consisting of an
        anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6 Ab</ENAMEX> fused to 
        Pseudomonas exotoxin was found to
        inhibit proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exogenous IL-6</ENAMEX> activated androgen responsive gene
        expression in the absence of androgens in human LNCaP cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . More work is needed to clarify the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> in
        prostate neoplasia.
        While there is some evidence suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6-</ENAMEX>mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplasia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 22</NUMEX> ] , a system suitable
        for following the transformation of prostate cells during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> development remains lacking. We chose to use the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRP-154</ENAMEX> cell lines, derived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danielpour, et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , to examine the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6-</ENAMEX>mediated
        neoplastic progression via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STAT3</ENAMEX> activation. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> lines
        were derived from the same part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> prostate,
        following treatment in vivo with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -nitrosourea. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> are
        immortalized but not transformed, require several growth
        factors for in vitro survival, and do not give rise to
        tumors in vivo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> are transformed, grow in
        the absence of exogenous growth factors, and are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenic</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . These lines come from
        epithelial cells. While prostatic epithelium is resistant
        to neoplastic transformation, it is not resistant to the
        development of hyperplasia. Studying the neoplastic
        transformation events in a cell type inherently resistant
        to this type of change can yield much valuable information
        about the transformation process in prostate cells.

          which the serum was replaced by charcoal-stripped serum
          overnight. Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> nM testosterone for

          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AG490</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hrs.</TIMEX> The cells were removed
          with trypsin, and stained after washing with FITC-annexin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Î¼l/10 6cells</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caltag</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at room
          temperature. Apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (cells staining with
          FITC-annexin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) were quantified by measuring green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FL1</TIMEX> on the flow cytometer. CellQuest
          software was used to acquire and analyze the data.

        Results
        
          Determination of the phosphorylation state of STAT3
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRP-152 & NRP-154</ENAMEX> cells
          We had very preliminary data, from a microarray
          experiment comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> to NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells,
          which indicated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> might be over-expressed on
          NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> is active only when phosphorylated, we
          decided to confirm these preliminary results by looking
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phospho-STAT3</TIMEX> in both cell lines by intracellular
          flow cytometry. We observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> was constitutively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX>, but not NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells. Even
          when treated with testosterone as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> did not exhibit phosphorylated
          STAT3 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These data indicate that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed STAT3 observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene microarray</ENAMEX> was putatively active as a transcription
          factor, since the amount of phospho-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">STAT3</NUMEX> in NRP-154
          cells was increased relative to NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is produced constitutively by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and
          NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
          In order to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> was the activating
          ligand for phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX>, we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
          expression in untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> by
          intracellular flow cytometry. While both cell lines made
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells displayed a different pattern, in
          that there was a peak of cells negative for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This may have been due to heterogeneity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX>, since the parental lines had not been
          subcloned by us. Therefore, we derived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> clones of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> by limit-dilution cloning, and examined
          these for level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression. We observed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          clones were highly-positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, while the rest
          expressed little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, thereby accounting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2</TIMEX> peaks
          we observed in the parental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRP-154</ENAMEX> line (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor was expressed on the surfaces of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
          When we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and uncloned NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
          for expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor, we observed that all
          NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor, while the
          uncloned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that apparently
          did not express the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In studies
          currently underway, we are analyzing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> NRP-154
          clones we derived for differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor
          expression, and to see if there is any correlation with
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression.
        
        
          Effect of dexamethasone treatment on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and
          NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
          To examine the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autocrine IL-6</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX>, we looked at the effect of dexamethasone
          treatment on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression on both cell lines, and on
          high and low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX>-expressing clones of NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dexamethasone</ENAMEX> is known to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> synthesis by
          acting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>-response elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells were routinely grown
          in the presence of dexamethasone, so the effect on
          proliferation was not quantified. In the following
          experiments, we used dexamethasone-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and also
          treated the serum twice with activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">charcoal</ENAMEX>, to
          remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous steroids</ENAMEX> (stripped serum), then added
          defined amounts of dexamethasone for carying out the
          experiments. We observed that dexamethasone treatment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> synthesis without affecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> growth, as expected. In contrast, dexamethasone
          treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> did not inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
          synthesis; instead dexamethasone treatment apparently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">enhanced IL-6</ENAMEX> production (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). This effect was
          observed for high and low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX>-expressing clones of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, panels C and D), and therefore was
          independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> production by the cells. However,
          clones expressing low amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> expressed less
          enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> production that clones expressing
          high amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, panels C and D).
        
        
          Inhibition of JAK2 induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> but
          not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX> clones
          In continuing our studies on the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> in STAT3
          phosphorylation, we used the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">JAK2</NUMEX> phosphorylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AG490</ENAMEX>, to see if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibiting</ENAMEX> JAK2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> would inhibit survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX>, as had been described for LNCaP cells
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . We examined clones of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX>,
          selected by amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression each had: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-expressing clones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> low-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-expressing clones
          were used for these experiments. Treatment with the JAK2
          inhibitor for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hrs induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>, measured by
          cellular binding of FITC-annexin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRP-154</ENAMEX> clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). We detected no effect of the
          vehicle (DMSO) at the highest concentration used. Our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> imply that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">JAK2</NUMEX>-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3
          was essential for the survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX>, but that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> did not require activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JAK2</ENAMEX> for
          survival, regardless of amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> produced by the
          cell. Further experiments are underway to determine if
          STAT3 requires phosphorylation by a different kinase,
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK1</ENAMEX>, in NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> was constitutively phosphorylated
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Treatment of
        NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells with testosterone did not increase the level
        of phosphorylation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Even
        after testosterone treatment, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> was not phosphorylated
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown). There is evidence that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">androgen</ENAMEX> treatment may increase the survival of PCA cells
        through activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Further experiments
        are underway to test this possibility. STAT1, another
        signaling intermediate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>, has been
        observed to be activated in non-tumorigenic cells, and may
        function as a "check" for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> phosphorylation, a possible
        oncogenic event [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . We are investigating whether or
        not STAT1 is phosphorylated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JAK2</TIMEX> in NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells, and
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is required for the survival
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX>. These results would explain why we saw an
        effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG490</TIMEX> on NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells, in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phospho-STAT3</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        We looked at the effect of anti-rat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6 Ab</ENAMEX> on both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> or NRP-154 cell growth rate, but were unable to
        detect an effect, using 3H-thymidine incorporation to
        measure proliferation (data not shown). We think this is
        due to failure to reach high enough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX>
        (commercially-available <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) concentrations
        necessary to neutralize the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> produced by the NRP-154
        cells (highest concentration achieved was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>).
        We are limited in performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> studies by the lack of
        commercially-available rat-specific reagents. However, we
        are using alternative strategies in more experiments
        currently underway to determine the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> in STAT3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> to answer this important question in NRP-154
        cells.
        We found that dexamethasone treatment of NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibited IL-6</ENAMEX> synthesis without affecting cell growth. In
        contrast, dexamethasone treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> did not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibit IL-6</ENAMEX> synthesis; instead dexamethasone treatment
        eliminated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> negative peak and enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-6</ENAMEX>
        production albeit to a smaller extent in low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-expressing clones (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D). Enhancement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> production by dexamethasone treatment has been
        previously observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaposi</ENAMEX>'s sarcoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In
        the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>-responsive element
        for dexamethasone on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> may have been
        mutated to a form that does not bind steroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region may play a role in
        the tumorigenic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">constitutive IL-6</ENAMEX> expression in
        prostatic carcinoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Such polymorphisms have
        been described for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaposi</ENAMEX>'s sarcoma,
        and are believed to play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mediated
        progression of this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        We observed that inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> activation by
        treatment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG490</TIMEX>, which inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>,
        resulted in apoptosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> but not NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A possible explanation of the data would be the
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JAK1</ENAMEX> for phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT3</ENAMEX> in NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells,
        which would not be inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG490</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor
        binding activates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JAK1</TIMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK2</ENAMEX>, which in turn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This in fact has been shown
        to be the case for v-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">src</NUMEX>-transformed fibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Another hypothesis is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> in NRP-154
        cells is not dependent upon a signaling cascade, but is
        constitutive, possibly due to a mutation not unlike that
        contained within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the cSTAT3</TIMEX> plasmid generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bromberg</ENAMEX>,
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . We are investigating in detail the
        signaling pathway in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> to answer
        these important questions.
        The importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT3 activation</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> in prostatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> development has been suggested by previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> acting via its receptor
        has been shown to activate STAT3 in LNCaP cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> given
        exogenously, since LNCaP cells do not produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX>,
        resulted in increased growth of the cells concomitant with
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . LNCaP cells transfected with a
        plasmid conferring constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression
        demonstrated increased growth, relative to untransfected or
        sham-transfected cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . However, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> treatment of LNCaP
        cells reulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal differentiation</ENAMEX> and inhibition of
        growth, associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT3 activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 37 38</NUMEX> ] . The
        molecular basis for the apparent contradiction is unknown
        at this time. Continued use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRP-154</ENAMEX> cell
        lines in parallel experiments should be useful in
        elucidating the discrepancies among various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
        It is possible that exogenous or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autocrine IL-6</ENAMEX> is not
        required for constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> in NRP-154
        cells. For example, viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> might be incorporated into
        the genomes of prostatic carcinomas, as has been described
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaposi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sarcoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 32 33 39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . The route of
        introduction of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> is believed to be through
        previous herpesvirus infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 41</NUMEX> ] . Another
        possibility is that the insertion of the oncogene BRCA1
        results in the constitutive activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT3</ENAMEX> in NRP-154
        cells, as has been described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du-145</ENAMEX> prostate cancer
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> cells do not make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>; nor are they
        dependent upon it for continued proliferation in vitro.
        However, they were dependent upon STAT3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> for
        survival, as demonstrated by experiments in which
        anti-sense oligomucleotides for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> were incoporated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . We are currently performing similar
        experiments to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is a necessary ligand for
        the activation and survival of NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells.
        In summary, we have demonstrated that a major difference
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> is that NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-express the gene for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX>, relative to NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells,
        and untreated NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells. Furthermore, NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> constitutively-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT3</ENAMEX>, while NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells
        do not. Moreover, we found that while both cell lines
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">synthesized IL-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX>, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> production
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152 cells</ENAMEX> was inhibited by dexamethasone treatment
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Finally, we demonstrated that while both cell
        lines expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor on their surfaces, the
        patterns were different. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154 cells</ENAMEX> had a subpopulation
        of cells which did not stain with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX>,
        while all the NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> cells stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Although the results presented above give us more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, they do not tell us
        if constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> is a determining factor in
        the change to prostate neoplasia, or if anti-apoptotic
        factors induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> play a role in prostatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplasia</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-152</ENAMEX> and NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> cells exhibit
        fundamental differences in the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
        production by dexamethasone, and in the requirement for
        JAK2-mediated events for survival. The tumorigenic line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRP-154</ENAMEX> expressed phospho-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">STAT3</NUMEX> under normal growth
        condition, while the non-tumorigenic line did not. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicate a very important role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT3</TIMEX> in conferring
        the neoplastic state on prostatic epithelial cells, and
        point out the future direction of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s
        investigations.
