        The post-genomic era has introduced high-throughput
        methodologies that generate experimental data at rates that
        exceed knowledge growth. In particular, high-density
        biochips including complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deoxyribonucleic acid</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cDNA</NUMEX>) microarrays, oligonucleotide microarrays, and
        rapidly evolving proteomics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> represent modern
        tools able to interrogate biology on a genome-wide scale
        and generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of data points
        simultaneously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are beginning to
        appreciate the statistical rigors required for the analysis
        of genome-scale datasets, a rate-limiting step in knowledge
        growth occurs at the transition from statistical
        significance to biological discovery.
        A number of public efforts are currently focusing on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> and curation of gene-specific functional data,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink, Protein Information Resource</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIR</ENAMEX>),
        GeneCards, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proteome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomes</ENAMEX> (KEGG), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ensembl</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-Prot to name but a few [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . These resources provide exceptional depth
        and coverage of the functional data available for a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, but are not designed to effectively explore the
        biological knowledge associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in parallel. In order to facilitate the functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> and analysis of large lists of genes we have
        developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Database for Annotation, Visualization</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Discovery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX>), which provides a set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-mining tools that systematically combine functionally
        descriptive data with intuitive graphical displays [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> provides exploratory visualization tools that promote
        discovery through functional classification, biochemical
        pathway maps, and conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domain architectures</ENAMEX>,
        while simultaneously remaining linked to rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        biological annotation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> expedites the functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> and analysis of any list of genes encoded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, or fly genomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s functionality is
        demonstrated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> data of Cicala 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        System architecture and maintenance
        
          Analysis modules
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main modules: Annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tool, GoCharts, KeggCharts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DomainCharts</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotation Tool</ENAMEX> is an automated method for the functional
          annotation of gene lists. Any combination of annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can be chosen from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> options by selecting the
          appropriate checkboxes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The annotations are
          added to the submitted gene list by selecting the upload
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">button</ENAMEX>, which returns an HTML table containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s
          original list of identifiers appended with the chosen
          functional annotations. Unannotated genes are included in
          the output with no appended data for tracking
          purposes.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX> module graphically displays the
          distribution of differentially expressed genes among
          functional categories using the controlled vocabulary of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology Consortium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>), which provides a
          structured language that can be applied to the functions
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in all organisms even as knowledge
          continues to accumulate and change [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The language
          is structured in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), wherein
          term specificity increases and genome coverage decreases
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves down the hierarchy. In contrast with a true
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hierarchy</ENAMEX>, child terms in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> may have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
          parent term and may have a different class of
          relationship with its different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of
          GO starts with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main categories, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Process</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Function</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular Component</ENAMEX>. Biological
          Process includes broad biological goals, such as mitosis
          or purine metabolism, that are accomplished by ordered
          assemblies of molecular functions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Function</ENAMEX>
          describes the tasks performed by individual gene
          products; examples are transcription factor and DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicase</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular Component</ENAMEX> classification type
          involves subcellular structures, locations, and
          macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>; examples include nucleus,
          telomere, and origin recognition complex. After choosing
          a classification type, levels that determine list
          coverage and specificity are chosen by selecting the
          appropriate radio button. Level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> provides the highest
          list coverage with the least amount of term specificity.
          With each increasing level coverage decreases while
          specificity increases so that level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> provides the least
          amount of coverage with the highest term specificity.
          Classification data is displayed as a bar chart, where
          the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> represents the number of gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX> in each category. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can set
          visualization parameters for sorting output data and
          displaying categories that contain at least a minimum
          number of genes. Selecting an individual bar opens a new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTML</ENAMEX> table displaying the gene identifier, LocusLink
          number, gene name, the current classification, and other
          classifications for each gene in that category. A 'Show
          All' button opens a new HTML table displaying all
          classification data and a 'Show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chart Data</ENAMEX>' button opens
          an HTML table containing the underlying chart data, thus
          allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to recreate customized chart graphics in a
          spreadsheet program. A new chart can be displayed for any
          subset of genes by selecting the classification type and
          level using the checkboxes and radio buttons available
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s current page that allow for drill-down
          capabilities. A count of the number of genes annotated is
          included in the output, and unannotated genes are binned
          into the 'unclassified' category, thus providing users
          with an automated tracking system for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX>.
          KeggCharts graphically display the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Each pathway is linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> pathway map,
          wherein differentially expressed genes from the original
          list are highlighted in red. In this view genes are
          further linked to additional annotations available
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX>'s DBGET retrieval system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . As with
          GoCharts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can set visualization parameters for
          sorting output data and displaying categories that
          contain at least a minimum number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the
          KeggCharts visualization inherits all of the dynamic
          features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX>.
          DomainCharts display the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domains
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Each domain designation is linked to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conserved Domain Database</ENAMEX> (CDD) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI), where details
          regarding domain function, structure and sequence are
          readily available. As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KeggCharts</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can set visualization parameters for sorting output
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and displaying categories that contain at least a
          minimum number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the DomainCharts
          visualization inherits all of the dynamic features of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KeggCharts</ENAMEX>. For further information
          regarding the functionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> visit the FAQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> at [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX> to mine functional annotation
          To demonstrate the functionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> we analyzed
          a list of genes differentially expressed in human
          peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after
          incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 envelope proteins</ENAMEX>. Details of the
          experimental, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA preparation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> hybridization
          procedures, along with details of the chip-to-chip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalizations</ENAMEX> and statistical analysis of differential
          gene expression are provided in Cicala 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human PBMCs</ENAMEX> and monocyte-derived macrophages were
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> with HIV-1 envelope protein
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gp120</NUMEX>). High-density oligonucleotide microarrays
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix HU-95A GeneChip</ENAMEX>) were used to monitor
          gp120-induced transcriptional events. This analysis
          resulted in the identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX> differentially
          expressed genes.
          Whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> modulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1 gp120</TIMEX> have
          previously been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV replication</ENAMEX> and/or
          envelope signaling, the remaining genes are of unknown
          function or have never been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> or
          gp120. Converting this list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into biological
          meaning requires the gathering of pertinent information
          from several data repositories. For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> this
          process consists of iterative browsing through several
          databases for each gene, manually gathering gene-specific
          information regarding sequence, function, pathway, and
          disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the systematic approach
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> simultaneously adds biologically rich
          information derived from several public data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to
          lists of genes in parallel. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selecting DAVID</ENAMEX>'s Annotation
          Tool and uploading the list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX> differentially
          expressed genes initiates the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> and
          analysis of the entire dataset. Once submitted, the gene
          list is stored for the entire analysis session, allowing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to switch between modules without having to
          resubmit data.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotation Tool</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotation Tool</ENAMEX> provides several annotation
          options and builds a tabular view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> gene list
          and the available annotations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Choosing the
          annotation fields <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Symbol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LocusLink</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unigene</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reference Sequence</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Name</ENAMEX> followed by selecting
          the 'Upload' button produces an HTML table in the web
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">browser</ENAMEX> containing all genes and their available
          annotations, where gene identifiers, descriptive and
          classification data are pulled from the database and
          appended to the gene list (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Gene identifiers
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Symbol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> are hyperlinked to
          additional gene-specific data available at their original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, thus providing in-depth gene-specific details
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotation pedigrees</ENAMEX>. Classification data and
          functional summaries can be used to quickly scan for
          information relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>'s experimental
          system. The server time required for execution of this
          module correlates linearly with the size of the gene list
          and takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 45 seconds</TIMEX> for lists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</NUMEX>
          genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, numbers in parentheses represent r
          2values). These results demonstrate the power and
          efficiency of an integrated approach to the functional
          annotation of large datasets.
        
        
          GoCharts
          Choosing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX> module opens a new window with a
          variety options. Users choose between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general types
          of classification (biological process, molecular
          function, and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> levels of
          annotation that represent term coverage and specificity
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis Modules</ENAMEX> section). Any combination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and coverage level can be specified. Also
          included are options to annotate gene lists with all GO
          terms available or only the most specific terms, which
          are referred to as terminal nodes. The option to choose
          different levels of term specificity provides needed
          flexibility and thus allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to determine
          dynamically which level of coverage and specificity best
          suits their data and stage of analysis. For instance,
          early-stage analyses may consist of annotating gene lists
          with very general terms in order to gain a broad
          understanding of the data. In this case, selecting
          biological process and level 1 classifies genes using
          general terms such as 'death' and 'cell communication'.
          Using increased term specificity facilitates the
          extraction of more detailed functional information. In
          this case selecting biological process and level 5
          classifies genes using terms such as 'apoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> changes' and 'chemosensory perception'.
          However, increased term specificity comes a cost, in
          that as it increases list coverage decreases (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          In our studies we find that level 2 typically maintains
          good coverage while also providing meaningful term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. Figure 4aillustrates how the GoCharts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualization</ENAMEX> quickly reveals that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> differentially
          expressed genes are involved in 'stress responses'. Each
          GO term can be viewed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or DAG views by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperlinks</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuickGO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          Because HIV-1 has a major impact on the function of
          cells of the immune system and their ability to carry out
          stress responses, we selected the histogram bar
          representing the number of genes involved in stress
          response, which opens an HTML table containing the
          Affymetrix identifier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> number, gene name, the
          current classification, and other classifications for all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). Now that we have reduced our gene
          list to those genes involved in stress responses, we
          further characterized this subset by repeating the
          GoCharts procedure available at the top of the
          stress-response HTML table. Choosing molecular function,
          level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> produces a new histogram that quickly reveals
          that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16/35</NUMEX>) of the stress-response genes
          possess cytokine activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). Indeed, cytokines
          have been shown to play an important part in the HIV-1
          life cycle and the results obtained here suggest that
          treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> with HIV-1 envelope proteins
          significantly modulates the transcription of numerous
          cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The efficiency with which GoCharts
          systematically summarized this large dataset with graphic
          visualizations, while remaining linked to primary data
          and external resources drastically improved the discovery
          process.
        
        
          KeggCharts
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5adepicts</NUMEX> the output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KeggCharts</ENAMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histogram</ENAMEX> displaying the distribution of differentially
          expressed genes among biochemical pathways. The chart
          shows that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> pathway of apoptosis includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          genes induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1 gp120</TIMEX>. Selecting the pathway name
          opens the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> biochemical pathway map and
          highlights in red outline the differentially expressed
          genes functioning in that pathway (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). In this
          view genes are further linked to additional annotations
          available through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX>'s DBGET retrieval system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> apoptosis pathway
          are highlighted in red, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KeggCharts</ENAMEX> tool mapped
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> to the apoptosis pathway. This
          difference is due to the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the Affymetrix
          probesets are targeting the same 'TNF-alpha' gene.
        
        
          DomainCharts
          DomainCharts are operationally akin to both KeggCharts
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GoCharts</ENAMEX>, except that the results visually depicting
          the distribution of genes among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domains
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DomainCharts</ENAMEX> histogram identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          genes with kinase domains (pkinase), probably reflecting
          the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 gp120</ENAMEX> on the signal transduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>. The chart also identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with
          interleukin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>), a domain that represents a
          highly conserved motif among stress-response cytokines.
          Selecting the domain name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'IL8</ENAMEX>' opens the Conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain Database</ENAMEX> (CDD) page corresponding to that PFAM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). This page provides detailed sequence,
          structure, and functional information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>
          domain and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain it.
        
      
      
        Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX> with related programs
        
          Exploratory tools
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FatiGO</ENAMEX> is a web-accessible application that functions
          in much the same way as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX>, including the
          ability to specify term-specificity level. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FatiGO</ENAMEX> does not allow the setting of a minimum hit
          threshold for simplified viewing of only the most highly
          represented functional categories. Likewise, FatiGO
          limits the graphical output to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> top-level GO
          category at a time, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX> allows the combined
          viewing of biological process, molecular function, and
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component annotations</ENAMEX> simultaneously. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FatiGO</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">static barchart</ENAMEX> output looks very similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoChart</ENAMEX>; an important distinction is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s
          GoCharts are dynamic, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to drill-down and
          traverse the GO hierarchy for any subset of genes, view
          the underlying chart data and associated annotations, and
          link out to external data repositories including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuickGO</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3the</ENAMEX> majority of
          accession types accepted and functional annotations
          offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> are not available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FatiGO</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is a standalone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> application that requires
          downloading of the program itself along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auxiliary</ENAMEX> files, one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> visualization and another
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visualization</ENAMEX>. The remote database
          queried by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is reported to be updated every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. It has been our experience that, to accurately
          reflect the current knowledge associated with a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, functional annotation data must be updated far more
          frequently. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> wish to use GoMiner with a local
          copy of its annotation database, they must also download
          and install a local copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX> database and the
          required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, a process that may be difficult for
          inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> is
          web-accessible and updated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. The functionality of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is most similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoCharts</ENAMEX> module. An
          enhanced feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is that it provides intuitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> views of genes embedded within the GO
          hierarchy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> has the ability to display such views
          through hyperlinks of GO terms to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuickGO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and DAG
          views. A unique function provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> is the ability
          to drill-down and traverse the GO hierarchy for any
          subset of genes sharing a common classification, as
          demonstrated by the identification of stress response
          genes with cytokine activity. Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> nor DAG
          view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> provides this functionality.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of biological knowledge associated with any
          list of genes extends far beyond the structured
          vocabulary of GO. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> provides, in addition to
          GoCharts, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional analysis modules that utilize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PFAM protein</ENAMEX> domain designations and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> to graphically summarize the distribution of
          genes among functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> and pathways. Moreover,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> highlights pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> within the biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX>. Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> provides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperlinks</ENAMEX> to pathway databases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioCarta</ENAMEX> and KEGG
          for individual genes, lists of genes can only be batch
          processed in the context of GO. In addition to providing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperlinks</ENAMEX> to external data repositories for each gene,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> provides links to primary sequence information
          available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> and human-curated functional summaries
          parsed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LocusLink</ENAMEX>. These features are not available
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GoMiner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> can be used to collect, analyze and
          explore functional annotation associated with human,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, and 
          Drosophila gene lists, whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is restricted to analyzing human data. Another
          restrictive feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> is that it only takes <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX>
          gene symbols as input. This is problematic in that many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) do not have <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX>
          symbols. Moreover, this restriction requires the
          translation of every gene list into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX> symbols.
          Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GoMiner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> is a stand-alone, exploratory
          tool for the analysis of lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the
          context of GO. The downloadable program comes with a copy
          of the supporting relational database of gene to GO-term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. However, as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> there are
          important considerations regarding the installation,
          support, and updating of the software and underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the documentation and bug
          reports listed on their website. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, in addition
          to the batch processing of gene lists within the context
          of GO, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> provides functionality similar to that
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KeggCharts</ENAMEX>, providing the ability to view
          lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the context of biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. However, in order to use this functionality
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> must download additional
          programs and files, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> program and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated MAPP</ENAMEX> files, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KeggCharts</ENAMEX> module of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX> is easily accessible at the click of a button.
        
        
          Annotation tools
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENSMART</ENAMEX> is a web-accessible application that
          integrates an enormous amount of functional annotation
          for numerous species. ENSMART takes as input lists of
          several accession types, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>,
          making it quite flexible. Database cross-references
          provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENSMART</ENAMEX> cover a broad spectrum of functional
          annotations pertaining to gene- and protein-specific
          attributes as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and cross-species
          attributes. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are limited to a maximum of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cross-references for a given gene list. Unlike
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENSMART</ENAMEX> does not provide graphic summaries of GO
          categories, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX>, or biochemical pathway
          membership, nor does ENSMART provide the ability to
          drill-down within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes sharing common
          functional features.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneLynx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Source</ENAMEX> are highly similar web-accessible
          annotation tools that provide a wealth of gene-specific
          information for individual genes and both are flexible in
          that they take as input several different accession
          types. However, the rich information and available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperlinks</ENAMEX> provided in single-gene mode is lost when
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneLynx</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Source</ENAMEX> are used to batch process lists
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The output of batch processing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Source</ENAMEX> is a
          text-style table that is feasible for download and
          automated processing, but provides little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for
          interactive exploration. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneLynx</ENAMEX> can perform
          batch searching for a list of genes, functional
          annotations must be viewed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> at a time.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatchMiner</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> program of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX> that
          performs the translations of gene accession types into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX> symbols required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoMiner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatchMiner</ENAMEX> is
          simply a web-accessible resource for translating
          accession types. It takes several accession types but
          does not take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> numbers, and although it was
          reported to accept identifiers from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatchMiner</ENAMEX> returned no data for several gene lists
          composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuFL6800</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>. Notably, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatchMiner</ENAMEX> does
          not provide any functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> and is restricted
          to human data. Thus, within the context of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploratory</ENAMEX> and annotation tools discussed here,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatchMiner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> is limited, or supportive, at
          best.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resourcerer</ENAMEX> is a web-accessible application for
          comparing and annotating human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> GeneChip
          and microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>. A major feature of Resourcerer
          is its broad coverage of microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and its
          ability to identify overlapping gene targets between
          chips, even across technology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and species
          barriers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resourcerer</ENAMEX>'s output is in tabular form and
          provides hyperlinks to accession cross-references such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resourcerer</ENAMEX> does not provide graphic
          summaries or annotations from GO, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX>, or any
          other resource, thus limiting its utility as a tool for
          functional annotation.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, the development of any complete, 
        in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">silico</NUMEX> discovery system requires
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">query</ENAMEX>-based access to an integrated, up-to-date view
        of all relevant information, regardless of its physical
        location and content structure. Still in its infancy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX>
        represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of our continued development
        efforts that aim to integrate information-rich data sources
        and provide quantitative summaries and analysis methods. In
        addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">functionality</ENAMEX> reported here, the methods of
        Hosack 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] have been incorporated
        into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAVID</ENAMEX> analysis module called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EASEonline</ENAMEX> , which allows users to
        identify statistically over-represented functional
        categories within a given list of genes. Committed to
        maintaining a system able to coevolve with technological
        advances and the new forms of data that are sure to follow,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID</ENAMEX>'s current design elements provide automated solutions
        that enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to rapidly discover biological
        themes in large datasets consisting of lists of genes.
