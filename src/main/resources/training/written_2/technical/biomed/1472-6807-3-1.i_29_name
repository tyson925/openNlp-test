        Polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs),
        which is central to a variety of crucial biological
        processes, including transcription, primer synthesis during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>, addition of polyA tails to mRNA, addition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCA</ENAMEX> to tRNA, uridylation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX>, replication of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>, amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in eukaryotic
        post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and
        oligoadenylate synthesis during interferon signaling, is
        catalyzed by a broad variety of distinct enzymes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX>
        ] . These polymerases belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major mechanistic
        categories, those that copy a nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid template</ENAMEX> and
        those that are independent of a template. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> (DDRPs) involved in the transcription of
        cellular and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viral genes</ENAMEX>, primases, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> (RDRPs) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> and cellular PTGS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are template-dependent polymerases.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Template-independent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerases
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nucleotidyltransferases</NUMEX>) include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCA</ENAMEX>-adding enzymes, polyA
        polymerases, uridylyl transferases and oligoA-synthetases.
        Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> function as single-subunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, whereas others form large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that consist
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>, distinct subunits; however, in all known
        cases, the basic catalytic activity maps to a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypeptide</ENAMEX> containing a characteristic metal-chelating
        active site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Typically, active sites of
        polymerases contain acidic or polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, which
        coordinate divalent metal cations, most often Mg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. The
        metal cations direct a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' nucleoside triphosphate to form a
        phosphoester bond with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hydroxyl of the preceding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-terminal nucleotide of a growing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polynucleotide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>), with the elimination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrophosphate</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Despite the basic biochemical similarity among all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        polymerases, sequence and structure comparisons indicate
        that these enzymes belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> evolutionarily
        unrelated folds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major
        lineage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid polymerases</ENAMEX>, which additionally
        includes reverse transcriptases, archaeo-eukaryotic DNA
        polymerases, and nucleotide cyclases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase of certain bacteriophages,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX>, and the archaeo-eukaryotic primase (also
        detected in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>) are divergent derivatives of the
        same fold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14</NUMEX> ] . The core catalytic domain of all
        these enzymes, the so-called "palm" domain, has an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-recognition motif (RRM)-like fold with strategically
        placed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-coordinating residues</ENAMEX>, which form the active
        site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15 16</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, bacterial DnaG-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primases</ENAMEX> (also present in archaea and some eukaryotes)
        contain a polymerase domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rossmann</ENAMEX>-like TOPRIM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, which is shared with topoisomerases and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLD</ENAMEX>-family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . The recently solved structures of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and the thermophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> Thermus
        thermophilus indicate that the β' subunit (according to the
        subunit nomenclature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Escherichia coli DDRP</ENAMEX>, which we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hereinafter</ENAMEX> employ to designate all orthologs of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">respective E. coli subunits</ENAMEX>) of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> defines
        another distinct catalytic scaffold, which is unrelated to
        any of the above <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template-dependent RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Additionally, the structural and evolutionary
        affinities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template-dependent RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">namely RDRPs</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] and primases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herpesviruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , remain obscure. In contrast to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template-dependent RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>, which have several
        distinct scaffolds of the catalytic domains, all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template-independent RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> have the same fold of
        the principal catalytic domain and belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> β
        superfamily of nucleotidyl transferases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase activity apparently has been
        independently "invented" on several occasions.
        Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> is one of the most conserved enzymes,
        which is represented, without exception, in all cellular
        life forms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> from most organisms
        consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 15</NUMEX> polypeptides. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> subunits,
        which correspond to the bacterial α, β, β' and ω, are
        universally present in all cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> and constitute
        the conserved DDRP core [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Orthologs of the β and β'
        subunits are also encoded in the genomes of several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of large eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> studies have shown that the catalytic site of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> resides in the β' subunit and contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> invariant
        aspartates that coordinate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 36</NUMEX> ] .
        Recent structural analyses demonstrated that the core of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> is assembled around the β and β' subunits, which
        interact with each other to form a positively charged
        nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding cleft. The α subunit further
        stabilizes this cleft, whereas the ω subunit interacts with
        the β' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Given their ubiquitous presence in
        all cellular life forms and high level of sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, it seems evident that the core subunits of
        this complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> synthesis machine were already present in
        the last universal common ancestor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX>) of the extant
        cellular life forms and performed functions mechanistically
        similar to those of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>.
        In contrast to the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">RDRPs</ENAMEX> that
        are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> so far have been detected only in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 26</ENAMEX> ] . The PTGS phenomenon covers a variety
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">complementarity-dependent silencing pathways</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and slime mold,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-suppression (silencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and the
        corresponding endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and virus gene resistance
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and quelling in fungi, all of which share a
        common mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> turnover [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] .
        Essentially, double-stranded (ds) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, which is formed in
        these processes, triggers the activation of a
        sequence-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> degradation system, which targets
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologous RNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] . The dsRNA is broken down by the
        Dicer enzyme into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-25</NUMEX> nucleotide (nt) fragments called
        small interfering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or siRNAs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45</NUMEX> ] . The siRNAs
        subsequently associate with a complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> called
        RISC and target homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> by serving as guides for
        multiple rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA cleavage</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> is a component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> system that has been
        initially described in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> as a cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
        activity induced upon viral infection that synthesized
        antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in a primer-dependent or independent manner [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 47 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Subsequent genetic studies showed that
        mutations in RDRP genes impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> in a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 38 51 52</NUMEX> ] . Experimental studies in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> suggested
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> is involved in production and amplification
        of dsRNA using the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as template and siRNAs as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> or guides and resulting in amplification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silencing</ENAMEX> response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55 56</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> is present in one or more copies in a wide
        range of eukaryotes, from early-branching parabasalids,
        such as 
        Giardia , to multicellular forms,
        including fungi, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58</NUMEX> ] . This broad
        representation in eukaryotes, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that are
        considered primitive, suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> might have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in the genome of the common ancestor of all modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. However, this gene has been subsequently lost
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several eukaryotic</TIMEX> lineages, such as the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>
        and vertebrates. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> display some diversity in
        domain architecture and the level of sequence conservation,
        they form a tight, well-conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of large proteins
        with no detectable prokaryotic or viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologs</ENAMEX>.
        Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of RDRPs
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> in an attempt to unveil the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX>.
        We identify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> homologs of the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">RDRP</ENAMEX> outside
        the eukaryotic clade, in bacteriophages, and show that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> share a homologous catalytic core, which
        comprises a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-stranded double<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-psi-β-barrel</NUMEX> (DPBB) domain.
        Evidence is presented that the ultimate ancestor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX> might have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding DPBB domain,
        which functioned as a cofactor for a polymerase ribozyme,
        and that subsequent evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> proceeded
        via accretion of various simple modules, such as the
        sandwich-barrel hybrid motif domain, around this conserved
        core.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and
          prediction of their active site
          To investigate the evolutionary affinities of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>, we carefully examined the results of BLAST
          searches of the non-redundant (NR) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) for various RDRP sequences. These searches
          identified a large region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">module</ENAMEX> shared by all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>. This region was
          further examined by searches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> using the PSI-BLAST
          program, which was iterated to convergence with a profile
          inclusion threshold of E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. These searches, e.g. the
          search initiated with the core RDRP module from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petunia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37-775</NUMEX>), readily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrieved RDRPs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , 
          Dictyostelium discoideum , several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, and 
          Giardia lamblia with statistically
          highly significant expectation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) values. Interestingly,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> iteration of this search retrieved the YonO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis phage Spβc2</ENAMEX> with
          a significant E-value (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7 × 10 -3</ENAMEX>). YonO was also detected
          with significant E-values in searches initiated with
          other eukaryotic RDRP modules, e.g., that of 
          Schizosaccharomyces pombe .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches started with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YonO</ENAMEX> protein
          sequence retrieved closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prophages</ENAMEX> in the genome of 
          Clostridium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetobutylicum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CAC1139</NUMEX>) and 
          Clostridium perfringens (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CPE1103</NUMEX>).
          Hereinafter, we refer to these bacteriophage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YonO</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> homologs (YRHs).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling alignment procedure detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          statistically significant motifs that are conserved
          across the entire set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX>, with a
          probability of occurrence by chance in this set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as <10 -18</NUMEX>. A multiple
          alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX> was constructed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-Coffee</ENAMEX> program and adjusted using the alignments
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST and secondary structure prediction.
          Secondary structure prediction, which was produced using
          the multiple alignment as the query, included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          α-helices and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> β-strands, which are conserved in RDRPs
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Conserved sequence motifs are
          distributed throughout the aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> motifs
          with the highest density of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> are
          located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between strands</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 and strands 18 and 20</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved in all sequences
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> are charged and one
          is polar (serine) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> charged and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polar residues conceivably</ENAMEX> might be involved in catalysis
          and substrate-binding. The most notable signature shared
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGD</ENAMEX> (b is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bulky residue</ENAMEX>) motif located between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 and 20</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Closely spaced acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that coordinate
          divalent cations are characteristic of the active sites
          of most nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid polymerases</ENAMEX>, in spite of the fact
          that they belong to several unrelated structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folds</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 13 14 17 28 29 59</NUMEX> ] . Given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGD</ENAMEX> motif is the
          only set of closely spaced acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> shared by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX>, it is likely to form part of the
          nucleotidyltransferase active site of these enzymes.
          Thus, these comparisons identify previously undetected
          prokaryotic homologs of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>, the YRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which probably also have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase activity.
        
        
          Structural and evolutionary relationship between
          the catalytic domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the DDRPs
          Interestingly, the PSI-BLAST searches started with the
          sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> module of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the YRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> consistently retrieved the β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>,
          albeit at statistically not significant E-values. The
          high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> pairs (HSPs) detected in these
          searches aligned the highly conserved region of the RDRPs
          between the predicted strands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 and 20</TIMEX>, including the
          DbDGD motif, with the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, which contains the metal-chelating active site,
          with a similar conserved motif, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DxDGD</ENAMEX>. Additionally, a
          search of the NR database with a position-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">scoring matrix</ENAMEX> (PSSM) that included all unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> sequences detected, with borderline E-values, a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Corynebacterium glutamicum</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cgl1702</NUMEX>), which
          also contained a DXDGD motif. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches showed
          that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of statistically
          significant similarity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          region of similarity corresponded to the conserved
          portion of the β subunits and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          corresponded to the core of the β' subunit and included
          the DXDGD motif (see discussion below). Despite the low
          statistical significance of the similarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>, the presence of the same signature motif in
          the experimentally identified or predicted active sites
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of enzymes prompted us to perform a
          detailed comparison of the catalytic domains of these two
          classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>.
          Among nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid polymerases</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DxDxD</ENAMEX> motif is
          conserved only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunits and the
          euryarchaea-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase subunit</ENAMEX> II. However,
          in the latter polymerase, the motif has the signature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGDED</ENAMEX>, as opposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DxDGD</ENAMEX> pattern shared by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. To investigate the distribution of this
          motif in the entire protein database, we conducted
          pattern searches using the GREF program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX>
          package, with queries corresponding to the residue
          conservation profile in the predicted active sites of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>. All these queries contained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DxDGD</ENAMEX> motif with
          additional flanking conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. The only proteins
          with evolutionarily conserved DxDGD motifs that were
          detected in these searches were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>, the β' subunit
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>, the integrin calcium-binding module, and the
          EF-hand domain (data not shown). Among these domains, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> was embedded in the context of conserved
          (predicted) β-strands only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>.
          Moreover, in searches conducted with extended queries,
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGDxhxh</ENAMEX> or DGDxhxh patterns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> is a hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residue</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> were
          identified as the only protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in which these
          motifs were conserved. We also ran database searches
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHI</ENAMEX>-BLAST program that combines a regular BLAST
          search with a pattern search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . In these searches,
          the active site motif was used as the pattern query, and
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> sequences as the sequence queries. All these
          searches retrieved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YonO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with significant
          E-values and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunits with borderline
          E-values. For example, searches seeded with the RDRP
          (RrpB gene product) sequence from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi:14475571</ENAMEX>) and the
          pattern [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAS</ENAMEX>]-D- [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLYMQN</ENAMEX>]-D- [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-D-X</ENAMEX>- [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLIVMFY</ENAMEX>]-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLIVMFY</ENAMEX>] detected the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> DDRP catalytic subunit with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.048</NUMEX>.
          Examination of the recently solved structures of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> showed that, although β' subunit is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          the active site containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DxDGD</ENAMEX> motif mapped to a
          small, compact β-barrel domain. A search of the PDB
          database using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] , with this
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">β-barrel</NUMEX> from 
          Thermus thermophilus β' subunit
          submitted as a query (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pdb: 1iw7</ENAMEX>, chain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> region:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">625-749</ENAMEX>), retrieved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of the
          CDC48-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA ATPases</ENAMEX>, formate dehydrogenases, aspartate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decarboxylases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barwin</ENAMEX>. The reported structural
          alignments span ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with significant Z-scores
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6</NUMEX>) and root mean square deviations (RMSD) between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-α</ENAMEX> backbones in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Å, which is
          characteristic of homologous domains. The region of
          structural similarity shared by the catalytic domain of
          the β' subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> and the above proteins
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a distinct globular fold known as the
          double-psi beta-barrel (DPBB) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63 64</NUMEX> ] . The SCOP
          database included the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase subunits</ENAMEX> in the
          multidomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> class but mentions the presence of a
          DPBB domain in each of the β and β' subunits ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] ;
          see below).
          The region of sequence similarity between the RDRPs
          and the β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>, that was detected in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">searches</ENAMEX> described above, almost precisely mapped to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>-fold catalytic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">multiple-alignment</ENAMEX>-based secondary structure prediction
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX> indicated that, like the
          similar region of the β' subunit, this region was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-strands</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Multiple alignment
          constructed on the basis of sequence alignments produced
          in the PSI-BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHI</ENAMEX>-BLAST searches and superposition
          of the predicted secondary structure elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and
          the experimentally determined structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> revealed
          considerable concordance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and DDRP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGD</ENAMEX> motif, which is
          located in the loop between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>, several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved between these polymerase families
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These include hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the
          β-strands, a conserved proline after strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, a small
          (typically, glycine) and polar (typically, aspartate)
          residues before strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that typically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX> the boundaries of secondary structure elements and
          several charged and polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A comparison
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> sequences using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling
          method identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conserved blocks</ENAMEX>, which were highly
          statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E < 10 -16</ENAMEX>) within the
          analyzed sequence set. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these blocks centered at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGD</ENAMEX> motif, whereas the other one encompassed
          strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>, which contain several partially
          conserved hydrophobic and polar positions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX> conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that
          are detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based alignments of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains are also conserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          These include a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doublet</ENAMEX> comprised of a small and a polar
          residues preceding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of strands 3 and 6</TIMEX>, a small
          residue after strand 2 (proline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunit
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX>), bulky and polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, a small
          residue immediately downstream of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, a bulky
          residue in the loop between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in strand 6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> differ from most of the DPBB
          domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunits in that the former lack a
          long and variable, in both length and sequence, insert
          between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> that is characteristic of the
          latter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast killer plasmids</ENAMEX> and the divergent
          predicted corynebacterial polymerase Cgl1702 also lack
          this insert (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Taken together, these observations
          suggest that, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the β' subunits of DDRPs
          show limited sequence similarity, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> share a homologous catalytic domain,
          which consists of a double-psi-β-barrel containing the
          metal-coordinating DbDGD motif.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains and early evolution of the
          catalytic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerases
          The SCOP database, while classifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> subunits
          in the multidomain category, recognizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DDRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these corresponds to the catalytic,
          metal-coordinating domain, containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DbDGD</ENAMEX> motif, in
          the β' subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">626-750</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pdb id</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1iw7</NUMEX> chain
          D), whereas the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> corresponds to the conserved
          core domain of the β subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">673-994</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pdb id</ENAMEX>:
          1iw7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> C). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains of the β and β' subunits
          interact to form the catalytic cleft of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerases, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved lysines in the β subunit
          protruding into the cleft and interacting with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, the DPBB domain in the β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is distorted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large inserts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4and see
          below) and shows no detectable sequence similarity to the
          β' subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>. Because of these inserts and the
          resulting distortion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> of the β subunit does not
          show similarity to any domains in structure database
          searches. Nevertheless, a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alignment</ENAMEX> based on
          visual inspection confirms the presence of all the 
          bona fide features of the DPBB
          domain in the β subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cgl1702</NUMEX> protein
          from 
          Corynebacterium , which we
          identified as one of the most divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> clade, showed similarity to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> only in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions, which corresponded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> from the β
          and the β' subunit. This observation, taken together with
          the spatial proximity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> in the catalytic
          cleft of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), indicates that these domains
          comprise the ancestral conserved core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX>. The arrangement of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> in the β
          and β' subunits suggests that, in the primordial ancestor
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> formed a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-tail"
          homodimer that bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> at the domain interface.
          Although the cores of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> subunits are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX> and are likely to have evolved from a common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> (see discussion below), they have completely
          different sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> and contribute
          distinct moieties to the catalytic cleft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 4</ENAMEX>).
          Thus, these specific active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> apparently emerged
          after the divergence of the β and β' subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX>,
          whereas the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> homodimer probably did not
          have catalytic activity and merely bound a ribozyme that
          originally catalyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerization</ENAMEX>.
          Subsequently, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits diverged from each other,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (β') acquiring a divalent cation-binding site in
          the insert between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> strands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>,
          whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> in the other (β) subunit acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that interacted with the nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. At
          this stage, which might be considered the emergence of
          modern-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>, the catalytic activity
          probably was taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          The basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> fold consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> β-strands and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          variable regions, which are located after strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand 5</ENAMEX> and, at least in some case, adopt a helical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63 64</NUMEX> ] . The domain can be further
          split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> symmetrical structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, each with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> core β-strands. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are combined into a
          barrel with a complex topology, with strand 5 wedged
          between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> and strand 2 wedged between
          strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX>, yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 'psi' loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The psi-loops between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> and between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strands 4</ENAMEX> and 5 often harbor the active site or
          substrate-interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX>.
          Sequence comparisons and identification of specific
          conserved motifs showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> fold includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          major superfamilies. These superfamilies are typified by
          the formate dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> (FDHC) domain,
          Barwin endoglucanase, aspartyl protease, and the DPBB
          domains from the β and β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamilies</ENAMEX> show a restricted phyletic distribution.
          Barwin-like endoglucanases are present only in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, whereas aspartyl proteases are found in
          eukaryotes, retroviruses and a minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The
          latter superfamily also has a circular permutation, which
          suggests secondary derivation. Thus, none of these
          superfamilies are likely to have been present in the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> common ancestor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX>) of extant life forms. In
          contrast, the DPBBs detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> subunits are
          universally present in all modern life forms and hence
          are traceable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDHC</ENAMEX> superfamily includes
          several distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of the
          CDC48-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA ATPases</ENAMEX> is present largely in eukaryotes
          and archaea and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of thymidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylases</ENAMEX> is archaea-specific. In contrast, the
          FDHC-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domain associated with oxidoreductases,
          such as formate dehydrogenase and
          molybdopterin-containing dehydrogenases, is widespread in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX> and all major lineages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> DPBB domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHDC</ENAMEX> superfamily
          probably was present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LUCA</ENAMEX>.
          The above analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LUCA</ENAMEX> probably encoded
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains. Although the DPBB domain in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase β subunit</ENAMEX> is distorted by inserts and
          shows extreme sequence divergence, its role in the
          formation of the catalytic cleft and the spatial
          arrangement with respect to the more canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> of
          the β' subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) are compatible with the
          hypothesis that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> shared a
          common ancestor to the exclusion of the other ancient,
          FDHC-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based sequence alignment
          shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> share
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains. These
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of symmetrically
          positioned small (mostly glycine) and polar (mostly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aspartate</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> preceding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">strands 3 and 6</TIMEX>,
          respectively, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> other small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bulky residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Of
          these, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues preceding strands 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          contribute a positive φ angle, which results in turning
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-α</ENAMEX> backbone to stabilize the β-barrel [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] .
          These shared features notwithstanding, the ancient DPBBs
          have no conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in their catalytic or
          substrate-binding sites. This is best compatible with the
          notion that the common ancestor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains was a
          generic binding domain devoid of high specificity or
          catalytic activity (see also discussion above).
          The same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interlock</ENAMEX> to give rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> also form another type of
          β-barrel via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal dimerization</ENAMEX>. This is the 
          E longation factor- 
          I somerase (EI)-barrel found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> translation
          factors, ferredoxin reductase, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L-fucose isomerase</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 66</NUMEX> ] . It seems likely that the EI-barrel and the DPBB
          evolved from ancient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
          which were stabilized via the formation of different
          barrel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo-dimerization</ENAMEX>.
          Several versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>, e.g., those in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerases, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIB</ENAMEX>, such as those in translation
          elongation factors and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein L3</ENAMEX>, are parts of
          ribonucleoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Other ancient forms,
          especially those that occur as accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in
          enzymes, appear to bind small molecules. Hence, the
          primordial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> might have formed
          barrel-shaped dimers that non-specifically associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or with small molecules. These generic barrel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> subsequently diverged to occupy different
          functional niches in ribonucleoproteins and metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>. These considerations, together with the inferred
          relationships between the different versions of the DPBB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> of early evolution outlined
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Only the last bifurcation of the DPBB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> in the proposed tree yielded the distinct forms
          present in the β and β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>, which
          apparently acquired catalytic activity. Substantial
          divergence of the β-barrels seems to have occurred at a
          stage of evolution when the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          activity resided in a ribozyme whose functioning was
          facilitated by a non-specific, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactor</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Ancient conserved domains and evolution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerases
          While all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, archaea and eukaryotes encode
          orthologs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> distinct subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">divergent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerases of baculoviruses and yeast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">killer plasmids</ENAMEX> and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corynebacterium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cgl1702</ENAMEX> protein
          only contain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> to the β and β' subunits. The
          minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> seems to be represented by the
          predicted catalytic core of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cgl1702</TIMEX>, which appears to
          consist entirely of the β-type and β'-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DPBBs</ENAMEX>, in this
          case juxtaposed in the same polypeptide. These
          observations are not particularly surprising given that β
          and β' subunits form the catalytic cleft of the DDRP
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), whereas the other subunits occupy peripheral
          positions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. In an attempt to gain further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into the early evolution of the catalytic core of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>, we sought to identify additional
          globular domains in β and β' subunits.
          Using the experimentally determined structure as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>, we split the β and β' subunits of the 
          Thermus thermophilus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> and the
          largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast DDRP</ENAMEX> into individual
          globular domains and investigated them by visual
          inspection of the topology, structural searches of the
          PDB database using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program and iterative
          searches of the NR database using PSI-BLAST. An obvious
          ancient conserved domain thus detected was a
          rubredoxin-like Zn-ribbon. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbons are widespread,
          small domains that are comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> β-hairpins
          bounded by consecutive extended regions stabilized by
          metal-coordinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the hairpin loops [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67 68</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 70</NUMEX> ] . Zn-ribbons are present in a variety of
          nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-binding proteins</ENAMEX>, including several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, translation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA
          synthetases, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase cofactors</ENAMEX> in archaea and
          eukaryotes, and several transcription factors. These
          domains are also present in other contexts where they
          function as structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scaffolds</ENAMEX> and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of
          redox reactions. The β' subunit of bacterial DDRPs
          contains a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Zn-ribbon</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> (region
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56-81</NUMEX> of 
          Thermus β' subunit; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> largest subunits of the archaeal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic DDRPs</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (regions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59-88</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">103-173</ENAMEX> in the
          yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>). The distal ribbon is distorted by a large
          insert between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> core <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the domain and a
          substitution of asparagine for one of the
          metal-coordinating cysteines.
          Although the sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbons of bacterial
          and archaeo-eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> have diverged
          considerably, their similar location in the orthologous
          polypeptides from different kingdoms suggests that β'
          subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX> already contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbon. Based on
          the crystal structure, it has been proposed that the
          region containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX> ribbon may interact with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> during transcription initiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          ] . Hence, it is plausible that a nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding
          Zn-ribbon had been recruited to the ancestral polymerase
          core, which consisted of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains, and
          contributed to non-specific interactions with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn-ribbon</ENAMEX> had been
          subsequently reused in several basal archaeo-eukaryotic
          transcription factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIS</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67 68 71 72 73</NUMEX> ] .
          A potential additional nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding moiety
          that is conserved in all β'-subunits is the AT-hook like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">module</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The AT-hook is a simple, small protein
          module that consists of a flap-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a
          positively charged surface that is inserted into the
          minor groove of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> AT-hook-like modules
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 583-603</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1IW7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> D) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunit
          are inserted within the α-helix that is located
          immediately upstream of the DPBB domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Previously, AT-hooks have been detected primarily in
          eukaryotic chromatin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, particularly
          transcription factors, where they function as accessory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] . The ubiquity of the
          AT-hook-like modules in the β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> suggests
          that they were recruited for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> recognition in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX> if not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.
          Analysis of a β-strand-rich insert between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the β subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 4, 6</ENAMEX>) led to the
          identification of another ancient conserved domain that
          could be traced back to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ancestral RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>. Visual
          examination of the structure of this insert domain
          revealed a topology with elements of both a sandwich and
          a barrel, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> "waist"-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that are
          characteristic of the sandwich-barrel hybrid motif (SBHM)
          fold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 76</NUMEX> ] (see also the SCOP database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] ). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> fold is present in biotin/lipoate carrier domains
          and their homologs found in a variety of enzymes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . A DALI search with this insert
          domain from the β subunit of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermus DDRP</ENAMEX> showed similarity to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> from various biotin/lipoate-binding enzymes,
          such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1bdo</NUMEX>) or dihydrolipoamide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetyltransferase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1iyu</NUMEX>) with Z scores of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6</NUMEX> and RMSD
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Å</NUMEX> in the aligned regions spanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 70</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. An alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domains from the DDRP
          β subunit with the previously identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> showed
          conservation of most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> characteristic of the SBHM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The defining structural feature of
          this domain is seen in the loop between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 7, 8</ENAMEX>). This loop is bounded by small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at
          each end (mostly valine at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> and glycine at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>) and has a distinct signature, with small
          (mostly glycine), charged (mostly aspartate) and
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> occurring in succession, in the
          middle of the loop (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 7, 8</ENAMEX>). These observations
          reveal an evolutionary relationship between the SBHM
          domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> found in other, functionally
          distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The core SBHM domain consists of a repeat of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with the characteristic "waist"-like
          structure occurring between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> strands
          of each repeat (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In the complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX>, strand 1
          packs with strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and the loops bounded by the two
          "waist"-like regions adopt an extended conformation
          resulting in the formation of a barrel. In the crystal
          structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>, the SBHM domain inserted into the
          β-subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> is in contact with the outward-projecting
          insert between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> of the β'-subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> also contributes to the
          stabilization of the catalytic site by forming an
          interface between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The universal
          presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> inserted in the DPBB domain of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β-subunit suggests that this domain was already
          present in the common ancestor of all extant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. The
          wide spread in different phylogenetic lineages of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domains, namely those found in
          dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase and the
          glycine-cleaving enzyme, is indicative of their presence
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LUCA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> is specifically
          related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biotin</ENAMEX>/lipoate-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          share a conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that is present
          immediately prior to strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">biotin/lipoate-binding SBHMs</ENAMEX>, this position is occupied
          by a lysine, which covalently binds organic radical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), but there is no evidence for such a
          role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β subunits. These observations suggest
          that the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> interacted with various ligands
          with a low specificity. From such a precursor, which
          existed prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LUCA</ENAMEX>, the SBHM domain apparently
          diversified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms, one that covalently bound
          organic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>, and another that specialized in
          non-covalent interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>.
          This latter form was recruited into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          catalytic core where it provided additional surfaces for
          the interaction between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains and formed part
          of the interface between the catalytic domains. Thus, it
          appears likely that the ancestral DDRP evolved from the
          coalescence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX> distinct domains: i) the DPBB
          that probably originally bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and, subsequently,
          segregated into the cores of the β' subunit, where it
          acquired the metal-coordinating active site, and of the β
          subunit, with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lysines projecting into the
          catalytic cleft (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn-ribbon</ENAMEX>, which was
          probably involved in interactions with the template, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>) the SBHM domain that stabilized the interactions
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domains</ENAMEX> forming the catalytic cleft
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Additionally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> AT-hook like modules, which
          probably had an accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding function, were also
          inserted into a conserved α-helix directly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of
          the DPBB domain in the β' subunit.
          The remaining conserved regions in the β and β'
          subunits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> do not show detectable relationship
          with any other ancient conserved domains. Examination of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> shows that they are principally composed
          of large α-helical hairpins that form coiled coil
          structures or stretches with successive shorter
          α-helices. Some of the other conserved regions consist of
          β-meanders with unusually long β-strands. These regions
          probably emerged, respectively, through duplication and
          divergence of a simple α-helical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> or through
          stabilization of long loops by selection for hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, resulting in the formation of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of
          the β-meanders.

          Further visual examination and structural alignments
          revealed the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domain in
          the β subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1iw7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> C: region <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">592-659</ENAMEX>) and several

          regions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">163-195, 248-308, 311-368, 369-419</ENAMEX> and

          search started with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> from the 
          Aquifex aeolicus DDRP β' subunit
          detected several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SBHMs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than the β'
          subunit, such as acetylornithine deacetylase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-4, iteration 2</ENAMEX>) and the phosphotransferase system enzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E = 10 -3</ENAMEX>, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This search also retrieved
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal SBHM domain of the β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> (e.g. 
          Thermotoga , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E ~10 -3</ENAMEX>) and,
          interestingly, also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NusG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
          Thermotoga maritima (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E = 2 × 10 -7</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">iteration 2</ENAMEX>). Reverse searches with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          of cytochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 11467387, residues 150-321</ENAMEX>)
          retrieved the bacterial β' sequences in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
          subsequent iterations with statistically significant
          E-values. None of these additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> were detectable
          in the archaeal or eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>, either in sequence
          searches or in direct comparisons of the crystal
          structures. Thus there appears to have been a
          lineage-specific proliferation and dissemination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial β</ENAMEX> and β' subunits show major variability in
          the distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacterial β</ENAMEX> subunits share <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX>, which is
          located <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of the DPBB domain. Similarly, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extra SBHM</ENAMEX>, located <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX>, is conserved
          in bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">β' subunits</ENAMEX>. In some cyanobacteria, the
          portion of the β' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> containing the SBHM occurs as a
          separate polypeptide. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> that are
          conserved among all bacterial lineages, a cassette of up
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> are present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of the DPBB domain
          in the β' subunit of 
          Thermus , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcus</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Similarly, the
          β' subunit of proteobacteria, 
          Aquifex , spirochaetes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> and chlamydiae contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional</NUMEX> set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> of the DPBB domain, preceding the
          C-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> that is shared by all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          The bacterial-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> domains present in the β and
          β' subunits are typically located on the periphery of the
          holoenzyme, which makes them accessible for interactions
          with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these SBHMs (regions <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">163-195</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">369-419</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1iw7</TIMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) are involved in the
          interaction with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ 70 subunit</NUMEX>, which is critical for
          transcription initiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Thus, it
          appears likely that, originally, the SBHM domain of the β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> participated in generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions that allowed the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> to recruit
          accessory subunits. Subsequently, in the bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX>, proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> provided for several
          other, specific interactions involved in initiation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX>.
          Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> that are specific to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacterial DDRPs</ENAMEX> show degradation of the "waist"-like loop
          of the first internal repeat. This is clearly a derived
          state because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> originally evolved through the
          duplication of a single ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that contained an
          intact "waist"-like loop between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>. The
          form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> with a shortened loop in the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> repeat is additionally seen in several
          bacterial-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX>. These include the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> of the phosphotransferase system enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permease</ENAMEX> or PTS-EII) found in several lineages of
          free-living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytochrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, and the
          NlpD-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall peptidases</ENAMEX> that are present in most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In addition to the specific structural
          relationship between some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> and
          those present in these bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, they also show
          detectable sequence similarity. For example, a PSI-BLAST
          search initiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> from NlpD retrieved the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">derived SBHMs</ENAMEX> of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> subunits
          (e.g. 
          Streptococcus β subunit, E = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">iteration 2</ENAMEX>) well before the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHMs</ENAMEX> (eg. 
          Mesorhizobium dihydrolipoamide
          acetyltransferase, E = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3</NUMEX>, iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The β and β'
          subunits of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DDRP</ENAMEX> are the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
          contain both versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Hence, it
          appears likely that the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> with the
          degraded loop in the first internal repeat initially
          evolved in the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DDRP subunits</ENAMEX>. Subsequently,
          these domains appear to have been recruited for various
          interactions in other bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Examination of the structure and multiple sequence
          alignments of bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">β</ENAMEX> and β' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> led to the
          identification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two additional</TIMEX>, distinct domains, which
          so far are not detectable in any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> and were accordingly designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beta-Beta' Module</ENAMEX> 1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BBM1</ENAMEX>, region <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">119-165,</ENAMEX> 1iw7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> D) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beta-Beta</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Module</ENAMEX> 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BBM2</ENAMEX>, region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1109-1190</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1iw7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> D) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Both these domains share an unusual, common structural
          core that we term the BBM-core (BBMC) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40-50</NUMEX>
          residues with an RMSD of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Å</NUMEX> over the aligned region. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBMC</ENAMEX> consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal helices that bound a
          central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> unusual, extended regions that fold
          into a curved hairpin structure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A). The BBM1
          domain is inserted after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbon in all bacterial
          β' subunits and, additionally, into the SBHM domain of
          the β subunit in proteobacteria, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and chlamydiae (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Notably, this is the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that contain
          extra SBHM domains inserted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region of
          the β' subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6and see above). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BBM2</NUMEX> domain
          shows a similar pattern of insertion: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          portion of all bacterial β' subunit contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra copies distal of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pan</ENAMEX>-bacterial copy. Proteobacteria, 
          Aquifex , spirochetes and
          chlamydiae have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BBM2</NUMEX> inserted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          region of the β subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The functions of these
          previously unnoticed modules and the nature of the
          apparent congruence in the evolution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> RDRP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> in a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> remain to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elucidated</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase α subunit</ENAMEX>-core-related domain
          and other elaborations of the archaeo-eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase catalytic subunits
          The bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DDRPs</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> α-subunits that form a
          homodimer at the "base" of the β-β' dimer and stabilize
          the catalytic-binding cleft. In the archaeo-eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX>, there is a duplication of the α-subunit,
          resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogous subunits, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RBP3 and RBP11</TIMEX>. In
          the eukaryotic DDRP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, these subunits occupy a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> position very similar to that of the α-subunit
          homodimer of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. All these proteins
          share a common α + β core domain, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> α-helices,
          which form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dimer interface</ENAMEX>. In the SCOP database, the
          α-subunit core domains have been classified together with
          several other domains, including the ligand-binding
          domain of the bacterial arginine repressor, the
          dimerization cofactor of the transcription factor HNF1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCOH</ENAMEX>), and a domain specific to the bacterial
          aspartyl-tRNA synthetases. To investigate this domain
          further, we conducted structural similarity searches of
          the PDB database using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program, with the
          α-subunits of the bacterial and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DDRPs</ENAMEX> used as
          the queries. These searches showed that the core domain
          of the α-subunits were most similar (Z scores <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSDs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.2-3 Å</NUMEX> over the aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>) to the
          arginine repressor ligand-binding domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] and
          several domains that were not previously recognized as
          being related (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B). These newly detected domains
          included the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SUI1</NUMEX> domain, that is found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF1</TIMEX> and
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> globular domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> gyrase<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Topoisomerase II</ENAMEX> and, most interestingly, a
          distinct globular domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX>: 1k83; region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1143-1271</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reciprocal DALI</ENAMEX> searches
          with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> readily recovered the α-subunits of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> as the best hits. For example, the domain from the
          yeast β' subunit hit the α-subunits of bacterial DDRPs
          with Z-scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Å. Hereinafter we
          refer to these domains as the 
          α -subunit core-related (ASCR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCR</ENAMEX> fold has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">β2-α-β2-α</NUMEX> topology and forms
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-layered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-stranded β-sheet and
          characteristic strand order of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2-4-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCR</ENAMEX> domains of bacterial α-subunits and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> RBP3
          share a common insert domain between helix-1 and strand
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, which apparently has been lost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RBP11</TIMEX> subunit of
          the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>.
          The ASCR domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast β' subunit</ENAMEX> is inserted
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another α</NUMEX> + β domain. Visual examination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX> and structural searches of the PDB database
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program showed that this domain it adopts
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition Motif</ENAMEX> (RRM)-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">β-α-β2-α-β</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">topology</ENAMEX> forming a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-stranded β-sheet. These
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> comprise a conserved module that is
          specifically shared by the archaeo-eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> to
          the exclusion of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">β' subunits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-domain module is inserted precisely in the same
          region as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal SBHMs seen in the bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the ASCR
          domain detected in the β' subunit are those present in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-subunits</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B). This observation suggests that
          the primary event in the divergence of the
          archaeo-eukaryotic β' subunit was the insertion of an
          RRM-like domain into the ancestral core. This was
          followed by the insertion of the ASCR domain, which
          probably evolved as a result of a duplication of the
          RBP3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/11</NUMEX> subunits, into this RRM-like domain. Both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> arrangement of the ASCR domain in the β' subunits
          and its extreme sequence divergence with respect to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCR</ENAMEX> domains of the α-subunit suggests that it has
          acquired a new function. The RRM-like domain and the ASCR
          domain are positioned in the exterior entrance to the
          catalytic cleft and could interact with cofactors or with
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. There is no evidence that the ASCR domain
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> α-subunits binds nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and studies on
          SUI1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the arginine repressor ligand-binding
          domain implicate the ASCR domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and small molecule binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 79</NUMEX> ] .
          However, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCR</ENAMEX> domains are present in proteins
          that interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> (see above), raising the
          possibility of a role in non-specific nucleic acid
          binding.
          Mirroring the insertion of the ASCR domain in the β'
          subunit, a distinct α + β globular domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal to
          the DPBB domain (region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">632</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1K83</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chain B</ENAMEX>), is
          inserted in the β subunits of all archaeal and eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DDRPs (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This domain contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-stranded sheet
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">β2-α-β2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">topology</ENAMEX>, with the strands in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-1-4-3</ENAMEX>
          order. Visual examination of the topology and searches of
          the PDB database using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program showed that this
          insert domain has the β-grasp fold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 81</NUMEX> ] . For
          example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALI</ENAMEX> search, the 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus immunoglobulin-binding protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGBP</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> code 2igd) was detected with a Z score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2</NUMEX> and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7</NUMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. This insert domain in the
          archaeo-eukaryotic β subunits resembles the version of
          the β-grasp domain that is present in the bacterial
          translation initiation factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IF3</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGBPs</ENAMEX>, in
          contrast to the distinct version found in ubiquitins,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferredoxins</ENAMEX> and ThiS. Specifically, the β-subunit insert
          domain shares a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-stranded core with the former group
          and, like these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, lacks a long insert between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal strands</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Given that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> lies in the periphery of the holoenzyme, it is
          likely to participate in interactions with cofactors,
          which is compatible with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
          function identified in several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the β-grasp
          fold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 81</NUMEX> ] .
          Thus, a common set of ancient conserved modules
          appears to have been repeatedly reused in the
          evolutionary diversification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          subunits from their ancestral cores. The lineage-specific
          domain insertions in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and in archaea-eukaryotes
          correlate with the fundamental differences between the
          basal transcription machinery of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> ] . This suggests congruent evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase catalytic subunits and the basal transcription
          factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Origin of the RDRPs
          The evidence of an evolutionary relationship between
          the core catalytic domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> has
          implications for the origin of the former group of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> is universal, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> is
          eukaryote-specific, a plausible hypothesis might be that
          RDRP evolved at the onset of eukaryotic evolution through
          extensive, rapid sequence divergence following a
          duplication of the β' subunit of the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>.
          However, despite extensive comparisons using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> and
          careful visual examination, we failed to detect any
          residual sequence similarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX>,
          outside the core DPBB domain containing the metal-binding
          active site. In particular, no traces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbon
          and the AT-hook-like modules, which are conserved in all
          β' subunits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), were detected. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> sequences
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> closely spaced lysines, which are conserved
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and might functionally
          correspond to the conserved lysines of the β-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DPBB</ENAMEX>.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are embedded in a secondary structure
          context that is enriched in predicted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-strands</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>);
          hence, in principle, this region might correspond to the
          β-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DPBB</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. However, the respective region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> sequences shows no detectable similarity to
          the to this DPBB domain, suggesting that the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functionally important lysines in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and DDRP
          might be convergent. In principle, radical divergence
          could have eroded all similarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and DDRP
          beyond the DPBB domain. An alternative, perhaps more
          likely explanation is that, while the core catalytic
          domains of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polymerases evolved from the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestral DPBB</ENAMEX>, they subsequently accreted distinct sets
          of peripheral modules around this core. The bacteriophage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YRH proteins</ENAMEX> show no specific relationship with the RDRPs
          from any one eukaryotic lineage, arguing against a recent
          lateral transfer from eukaryotes to the phages. Taken
          together, all these observations point to a scenario for
          the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX>, under which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRHs</ENAMEX> diverged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> at a stage of evolution that
          succeeded the divergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains of the β and
          β' subunits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) but preceded the emergence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LUCA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of substrates of the
          extant eukaryotic RDRPs are small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, such as microRNAs
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84 85 86 87 88 89 90</NUMEX> ] , and analogous small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> have been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91 92 93 94</NUMEX> ] .
          Given that small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">RNAs</ENAMEX> are likely to have been abundant in
          the hypothetical ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> might have been
          involved in the replication of such RNAs since an early
          stage of evolution. Should that be the case, the YRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> could be late surviving derivatives of these
          ancient enzymes, which apparently have been shunned from
          cellular life forms during the evolution of prokaryotes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eukaryotes</ENAMEX> might have acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> gene from a
          bacteriophage at an early stage of their evolution and
          retained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> thanks to the selective advantage
          conferred by the new level of gene expression regulation
          mediated, in part, by these enzymes.
          The eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> is part of a large ensemble of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionally</ENAMEX> linked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which include the Dicer
          helicase-nuclease, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIWI</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
          Hen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/Corymbosa</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA methylase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AlkB</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          demethylases, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Lin28</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 45</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] . Since no closely related homologs of any of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are encoded in the genomes of the phages that
          encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YRH proteins</ENAMEX>, the latter are unlikely to function
          in a biological context similar to that of the eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the extended similarity between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> sequences and the presence of potential
          nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding modules, such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          Zn-ribbon in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SpβC2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YonO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, suggest that the YRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> also have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase activity. Possible
          functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> include a regulatory
          activity via amplification of antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> or perhaps a
          more conventional role as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phages</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          General discussion and conclusions
          Here, we identified bacteriophage homologs of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic RDRP</ENAMEX>, which is involved in
          post-transcriptional gene silencing. We also present
          evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and the ubiquitous β' subunit of DDRP
          contain a homologous, metal-coordinating, catalytic
          domain. This domain adopts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> fold, in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signature DbDGD</ENAMEX> motif, shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX>, is
          ensconced in the insert between the ultimate and
          penultimate β-strands. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> DPBB domain is present in
          the β subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. This version of the DPBB
          domain lacks the metal-coordinating motif but contributes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lysine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, which are critical for substrate
          interactions in the catalytic cleft. The DPBB domain in
          the β subunit is distorted by large inserts and shares no
          detectable sequence similarity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> from the β'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> subunits
          are spatially juxtaposed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, with the
          catalytic cleft located between them. This arrangement
          suggests that the primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> was a head to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX> homodimer of a DPBB domain; a duplication of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primordial DPBB</ENAMEX> domain probably gave rise to the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBBs</ENAMEX> of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX>. The presence of completely
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> and the asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to
          tail arrangement of the monomers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> suggest that
          the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> dimer was not specialized, had no
          catalytic activity, and merely bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Originally,
          these DPBB domains might have functioned as protein
          cofactors that stabilized a ribozyme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> and
          eventually displaced the ribozyme as they acquired key
          residues required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based polymerase activity.
          This evolutionary scenario complements a similar model
          proposed for the evolution of the other major polymerase
          class, the palm-domain-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and DNA
          polymerases, whose primordial core apparently consisted
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRM</ENAMEX> fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          The β and β' subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> additionally contain a
          Zn-ribbon and a SBHM domain respectively. The former is a
          widespread nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding domain, whereas the
          latter functions in a variety of biochemical contexts as
          a small-molecule-binding and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
          domain. Analysis of the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> superfamilies
          within these folds and their phyletic distribution
          patterns suggests that diverse versions of these domains
          with distinct functions were already present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LUCA</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, several duplication-divergence events apparently
          preceded the emergence of the forms of these domains that
          are seen in the catalytic core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The ancestral versions of these domains would not have
          the adaptations for specific roles possessed by their
          descendant forms, such as those in extant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> or RDRP,
          and probably functioned as generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction domains</ENAMEX>, with the specificity
          conferred by catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules. Hence, considerable
          diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domains appears to have emerged
          prior to the "crystallization" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> ] of a transcription
          machinery similar to the one that operates in modern
          cells and probably had been already in place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LUCA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
          ] . Similar conclusions regarding the early stages of
          protein domain evolution have been reached previously as
          a result of evolutionary analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
          translation, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
          GTPases: substantial diversification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domains
          had occurred prior to the "crystallization" of elaborate,
          modern-type translation machinery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 97</NUMEX> ] .
          Although the major events in the evolution of
          polymerases occurred at very early stages of evolution
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX> already had an advanced DDRP resembling the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extant</ENAMEX> forms, subsequent lineage-specific elaborations of
          considerable magnitude have occurred. The most notable of
          these is the proliferation and dissemination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBHM</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBM</ENAMEX> domains in the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">β</ENAMEX> and β' subunits. In
          the archaeo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> lineage, another domain,
          apparently derived through duplication of the
          dimerization domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> α-subunit, was inserted
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region of the β' subunit.
          Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn-ribbon</ENAMEX> underwent duplication and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elaboration</ENAMEX> in the β' subunit and was also recruited in
          various transcription factors. Similarly in the
          archaeo-eukaryotic β subunit, a minimal β-grasp domain
          was added to the conserved core.
          While we provide evidence that the catalytic cores of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX>, their bacteriophage homologs and the DDRPs
          evolved from a common ancestor, the provenance of the
          rest of the conserved RDRP module and, accordingly, the
          evolutionary scenario for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> remain less clear. No
          similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRPs</ENAMEX> was detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> sequences
          beyond the core DPBB domain. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> module has emerged at the onset of the evolution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> through extreme sequence divergence following
          a duplication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> β' subunit. An alternative
          scenario holds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> are ancient enzymes that
          diverged from the evolutionary precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDRP</ENAMEX> at a
          very early, pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LUCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> of evolution, albeit after the
          duplication that led to the differentiation of the β and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">β'</ENAMEX> versions of the DPBB domain. In fact, it appears
          likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ancestral protein RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of the differentiation of the β-type and β'-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPBB</ENAMEX> domains, functioned as an RDRP because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> probably
          had not evolved by that stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> ] . The switch of the
          ancestral enzyme to the DDRP activity and the emergence
          of the evolutionary precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> might be
          tentatively linked to one another and associated with the
          advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. This view of the evolutionary history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> is compatible with the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRP</ENAMEX> homologs in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phages</ENAMEX> and with their role in replicating microRNAs
          (potential relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> world) during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, this enzyme apparently has been
          expunged from the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> synthesis systems and
          survived only in some parasitic elements, such as
          bacteriophages, through which it might have been
          reintroduced into the genome of an ancestral eukaryote.
          This scenario shows parallels to the probable
          evolutionary history of another major, unrelated class of
          polymerases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> and reverse transcriptases
          containing the palm domain. Among extant biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, these polymerases are encoded largely by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> and retroid viruses, but a reverse transcriptase
          had been recruited by eukaryotes as the catalytic subunit
          of the telomerase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 99</NUMEX> ] . There seems to be a
          distinct possibility that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDRPs</ENAMEX> are
          vestiges of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> world that have been largely
          displaced from cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biochemical</ENAMEX> machinery at an early
          stage of evolution, because of the deleterious effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA replication</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, while surviving
          in selfish genetic elements.
        
      
      
        Material and Methods
        The non-redundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) was searched using the BLASTP program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">100</ENAMEX> ] .
        Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) searches were
        conducted using the PSI-BLAST program, typically with a
        PSSM inclusion expectation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, and
        were iterated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 101</NUMEX> ] . Prior to
        PSI-BLAST searches, query sequences were evaluated for
        compositional bias using the SEG program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">102</ENAMEX> ] . If no
        such bias was detected, searches were run with the
        composition-based statistics turned off, in order to
        maximize sensitivity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ] . Multiple alignments of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> were constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>_Coffee
        program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">104</ENAMEX> ] , followed by manual correction based on
        the PSI-BLAST results. Identification and statistical
        evaluation of conserved motifs in multiple protein
        sequences were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling method as
        implemented in the MACAW program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105 106</NUMEX> ] . Pattern
        searches were conducted using the GREF program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX>
        package [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">107</ENAMEX> ] , and pattern-initiated BLAST searches were
        carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHI</ENAMEX>-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] ?. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
        structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> were searched for similar structures
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">108</ENAMEX> ] . Protein secondary
        structure was predicted using the PHD program implemented
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PredictProtein</ENAMEX> server with a multiple alignment
        submitted as the [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109 110</NUMEX> ] . Protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> and manipulated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-PDB viewer
        program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">111</ENAMEX> ] and the ribbon diagrams were made using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLSCRIPT</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">112</ENAMEX> ] .
