        As in the majority of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, successful
        embryonic development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> requires temporally and
        spatially specific gene expression essential to placental
        and embryonic differentiation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early gestation</TIMEX>.
        Expressing the appropriate transcripts during development
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig conceptus</ENAMEX> is essential for expansion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophoblast</ENAMEX> and placental attachment to the uterine
        surface. Prenatal mortality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> by term [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , the majority of which occurs during
        peri-implantation conceptus development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
        peri-implantation period is the most critical stage of
        conceptus development as a rapid morphological
        transformation of the trophoblast occurs just prior to
        conceptus attachment to the uterine surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Rapid
        transformation of the trophoblast, termed trophoblastic
        elongation, occurs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 11 to 12</TIMEX> of gestation.
        Trophoblastic elongation is initiated when a conceptus
        reaches a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mm sphere and then rapidly transforms into a
        long filamentous thread greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mm in length
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 hrs</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The process of trophoblastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX> is characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct morphological
        stages (spherical, ovoid, tubular and filamentous).
        Elongation of the conceptus is a short-lived phenomenon
        that results from cellular remodeling and migration, rather
        than through cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hyperplasia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Secretion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptus</ENAMEX> produced maternal recognition signal, estrogen,
        occurs simultaneously with rapid elongation of the
        trophoblastic membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Conceptus release of
        estrogen induces an acute phase response by the endometrium
        that alters the uterine environment, which may be
        unfavorable for less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">littermates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> has a diffuse epitheliochorial type of
        placentation, rapid trophoblastic elongation provides an
        essential biological function to satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conceptus</ENAMEX>'
        necessity for maximal placental-uterine contact to ensure
        adequate nutrient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gestation</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        It has been estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        must be appropriately expressed for successful
        pre-implantation and early fetal development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . A
        number of mRNAs hypothesized to be involved with early
        porcine conceptus development have been evaluated. Yelich
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] characterized gene expression for retinoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptors</ENAMEX> (RAR) Î±, Î² and Î³ as well as retinal binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (RBP) during early porcine conceptus development
        and trophoblast elongation. Results indicate expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBP</ENAMEX> increase during transition to conceptuses of
        filamentous morphology. Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-Î²</ENAMEX> has been
        localized in the porcine conceptus and its expression
        appears to be enhanced during trophoblastic elongation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] , which follows a pattern similar to aromatase expression
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        At present, knowledge of genes regulating rapid
        trophoblastic elongation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> is far from complete.
        Due to the limited insight on the transcriptional
        regulation of this critical developmental process, the
        objective of the present investigation was to utilize
        suppression subtractive-hybridization (SSH) to characterize
        and analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes during rapid
        trophoblastic elongation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>. Identification and
        characterization of gene expression patterns during rapid
        trophoblastic elongation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> will provide a better
        understanding of the events required for successful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implantation</ENAMEX> and embryonic survival.

          Research was conducted in accordance with and approval
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oklahoma State Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and Use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> crossbred, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cyclic gilts</ENAMEX> were
          checked for estrus twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the presence of an
          intact boar and naturally mated at the onset of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> estrus and again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> hrs later. Gilts were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hysterectomized</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 11 and 12</TIMEX> of gestation as
          previously described for our laboratory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . After
          removal of the uterine horns, conceptuses from each
          uterine horn were flushed into a sterile petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> with
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mL</TIMEX> of physiological saline. Due to the limited time
          frame when conceptuses are in tubular transitional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3 hrs</ENAMEX>) and difficulty in determining when
          tubular conceptuses are in the uterus following mating,
          one uterine horn was removed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX> of gestation in
          a subset of gilts. Conceptuses were flushed into a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sterile petri dish</ENAMEX> from the uterine horn and evaluated to
          determine an appropriate time-delayed removal of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> horn corresponding to the predicted time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX> would be in a tubular morphology as described
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geisert et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Morphology of conceptuses
          collected following flushing from the uterine horns was
          recorded and conceptuses of identical morphologies were
          transferred to cryogenic vials, snap-frozen in liquid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX>, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C until</TIMEX> extracted for

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> was assayed as a normalization control to
          correct for loading discrepancies.
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, quantitation of gene amplification
          was made by determining the cycle threshold (C

          effect, did not significantly alter the variation due to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and not all gilts were represented across all

        Discussion
        During early porcine development a rapid morphological

        expressed in filamentous conceptuses. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Messenger RNA</ENAMEX> for
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptor Î±</ENAMEX>, retinal binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Î²-3</ENAMEX> is also increased in
        filamentous conceptuses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Using a ribonuclease
        protection assay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] indicated enhanced
        cyclooxygenase-2 expression was specific to filamentous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX>. An autocrine effect of conceptus estrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> has been suggested as filamentous conceptuses
        have greater gene expression for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> Î²
        compared to its spherical and tubular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Suppression subtractive hybridization allowed isolation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes expected to be differentially expressed
        during rapid trophoblastic elongation. Differentially
        expressed genes identified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> striking particular
        interest were interleukin-1Î² (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>) and
        metallopanstimulin-1 (MPS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), both of which are suspected
        to be up-regulated in the elongated conceptus. MPS-1
        expression is notable in proliferating cells and has been
        identified as a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Further analysis indicates cells stimulated with
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Î²1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>) exhibit a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in MPS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are localized in the trophectoderm of porcine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 10-14</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gestation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . MPS-1
        may have roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">transcriptional-</ENAMEX>mediation of the
        embryonic response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> having effects on continued
        intra-uterine elongation. However, MPS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene expression
        needs to be quantitatively analyzed across the stages of
        conceptus development. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> was the most predominant clone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> and was also the most abundant clone
        represented when mapping expressed sequence tags derived
        from a porcine early embryonic cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in a study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . We have more thoroughly examined and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">confirmed IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> gene and ligand expression in developing
        conceptuses as well as the endometrium. Changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">conceptus IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> gene expression and ligand release in the
        uterine horn dramatically increase during the process of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geisert</ENAMEX>, unpublished results).
        Increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î²</NUMEX> gene expression was specific to the
        conceptus as endometrial expression was unchanged between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclic</ENAMEX> and pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gilts</ENAMEX>. Following completion of
        conceptus elongation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> gene expression and secretion
        rapidly decline and expression levels are more than
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>-fold lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15</TIMEX> compared to day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> filamentous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX>. It is possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> plays an important role
        in triggering conceptus elongation and initiating
        uterine-conceptus "cross-talk" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> transcripts; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OSU-T1-50</ENAMEX>, SAHH
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSC70</ENAMEX> were confirmed to be differentially expressed
        analogous to the pattern predicted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX>. Although no
        confirmed identity was found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, the novel gene,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OSU-T1-50</ENAMEX> displayed a very dynamic enhancement of gene
        expression during trophoblastic elongation. When compared
        to spherical conceptuses there was almost a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in mRNA expression for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OSU-T1-50</ENAMEX> in tubular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX> while expression in filamentous conceptuses
        increased over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold. Given the substantial increase in
        gene expression and temporal relationship to conceptus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OSU-T1-50</ENAMEX> may play an important role in
        trophoblastic elongation. Future studies will attempt to
        identify the gene and its translated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to determine
        the biological function during conceptus development.
        Gene expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> was similar between spherical,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovoid</ENAMEX> and tubular conceptuses, but there was nearly a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-fold increase in gene expression in filamentous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> may have significant impact on the
        conceptuses ability to use folates during this transitional
        stage of development. Folates have long been known to be an
        essential requirement for developing embryos, predominately
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neurulation</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallet</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        have previously shown the increase in maternal folate
        binding protein activity occurs in the uterine lumen of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclic</ENAMEX> and pregnant gilts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 10-12</TIMEX> post-estrus.
        The increase of folate in the uterine lumen is temporally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the increase in conceptus SAHH gene
        expression.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-adenosylhomocysteine</ENAMEX> (SAH) is the resultant product
        following the release of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s-adenosylmethionine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>), a universal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methyl</ENAMEX> donation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> has crucial developmental
        impacts governing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] as well as
        methylation of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, carbohydrates and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysaccharides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
        is the only known enzyme capable of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> hydrolysis. The
        breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX>, which is reversible, results in the
        release of free homocysteine which is converted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methionine</ENAMEX> while being used as a substrate for the
        reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-methylenetetrahydrofolate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-MTHF</ENAMEX>) to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrahydrofolate</ENAMEX> (THF). Elevated levels of methionine can
        then be used in the synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THF</ENAMEX> has
        downstream effects on uracil to thymidine conversions
        involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair and synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        SAHH functions as a protective enzyme for adenosine
        toxicity by preventing nuclear accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        and may explain the nuclear localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> in cells
        that are transcriptionally active in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> embryos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanaerts et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that high
        concentrations of homocysteine are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryotoxicity</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early gestation</TIMEX> in rats. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest the toxicity may be associated with the
        reverse hydrolysis of homocysteine to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SAH</ENAMEX> resulting in the
        dramatic reduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM/SAH</ENAMEX> ratio to a point where
        methylation reactions are inhibited. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] have revealed that the lethal nonagouti (a x)
        mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is characterized by deletion of the SAHH
        gene resulting in embryonic death prior to implantation.
        Addition of an inhibitor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-deazaaristeromycin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits</ENAMEX> inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> mass proliferation and differentiation
        during in vitro development of non-mutant embryos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        .
        As in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> is likely a biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM/SAH</ENAMEX> ratio controlling the occurrence
        of transmethylation reactions to the degree of which they
        are necessary for successful porcine conceptus development.
        Establishment of the maternal-fetal interface is extremely
        competitive among littermates in early <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine gestation</ENAMEX>.
        Advanced conceptuses, those that elongate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, have a
        much greater advantage with regards to acquiring ample
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placental</ENAMEX>:uterine contact and also limit the available
        uterine capacity for those conceptuses lagging in
        development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . While gene expression for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> was
        present at all stages evaluated, an approximate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in relative expression for this transcript over a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 hour</TIMEX> time period is noteworthy. It is possible that
        increased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX> by filamentous conceptuses
        serves as a protective function at the level of the nucleus
        by reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> to homocysteine thereby maintaining the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM/SAH</ENAMEX> ratio at appropriate levels for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>-mediated
        transmethylation reactions to occur. Increased SAHH
        expression by advanced conceptuses suggests there would
        also be increased homocysteine released into the uterine
        lumen that may have an embryo-toxic effect on neighboring
        conceptuses lagging in development.
        Gene expression for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSC70</TIMEX> was similar in spherical,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovoid</ENAMEX> and tubular conceptuses followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in filamentous conceptuses. Gene expression
        changes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSC70</TIMEX> during early development have previously
        been associated with neurulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chick</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX>. Negative mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSC70</ENAMEX> in the
        nervous system of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX> resulted in both
        developmental defects and lethality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The increased
        HSC70 gene expression during trophoblastic elongation is
        temporally associated with neural tube development in pig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptuses</ENAMEX>.
        Traditionally, heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are known for their
        function during cellular stress as molecular chaperones
        responsible for the folding, re-folding and transport of
        newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. HSC70 is a constituitively
        expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa heat-shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HSP70</NUMEX>)
        family. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have also been proposed
        to be involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP90</ENAMEX> chaperones regulating signal
        transduction pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP70</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSC70</ENAMEX> does not
        exhibit increased gene expression when exposed to heat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenate</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrula</ENAMEX> and neurula <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsang</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        suggested because of their ability to bind and transport
        folded and un-folded cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HSP70</NUMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may function as a cross-linker to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cytoskeletal matrix</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> of HSP70
        with the cytoskeleton suggests that conceptus produced
        HSC70 may be directly involved with the complex process of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conceptus</ENAMEX> remodeling during trophoblastic elongation.
        Through the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX>, we have detected several
        genes that may serve a vital role in differentiation,
        neurulation, as well as attachment and maintainence of
        pregnancy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detection</ENAMEX> and confirmation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAHH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSC70</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OSU-T1-50</ENAMEX> as being differentially expressed
        during the period of rapid trophoblastic elongation
        contributes important information towards understanding the
        mechanisms involved with this essential biological event in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>.
