        Hospital-based intervention programs, maternity ward
        practices, and the feeding preferences of health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, lactation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>) may
        affect breastfeeding behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Interventions to increase exclusive and any breastfeeding
        may also result in lower <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Observational results concerning the effect of
        information from health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in a non-trial
        setting are more ambiguous [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . In an early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard-Bonnin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
        nursing support without phone follow-up did not have a
        statistically significant effect on breastfeeding
        duration.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> may also play
        important roles in supporting and favoring breastfeeding [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Several studies have looked at the content of infant
        feeding information from the perspective of medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , but fewer studies have asked the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> if and when 
        they received breastfeeding
        information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . A literature search failed to identify
        any study that correlates information about breastfeeding
        in a non-trial setting with feeding patterns including the
        use of colostrum and prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants
        under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months of age</TIMEX> was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 50%</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> still being exclusively breastfed at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-9</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> had begun receiving solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Although several studies have dealt
        with infant feeding and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> and maternal health [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s knowledge there are no data
        on the relationship between attitudes towards breastfeeding
        and information about breastfeeding and the actual
        breastfeeding pattern in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        The main objective of the present study was therefore to
        investigate the relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and her family towards breastfeeding and the actual
        feeding pattern in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. A second
        objective was to study the relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information, specified according to source
        and timing, and feeding pattern.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study area
          This study took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>. The
          interviews were conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consultant rooms</ENAMEX>, waiting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">halls</ENAMEX> and maternity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wards</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Del Nino</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Octubre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gabriel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obrero</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Study population
          Bolivian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with an infant ≤ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year of age</TIMEX> were
          eligible for this cross-sectional study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Paz</ENAMEX> urban area or in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> within a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-hour</TIMEX> bus ride from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
          This study was part of a larger study on infant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feeding</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> interviewed about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attitudes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n-max = 502</ENAMEX>) or about breastfeeding
          information (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n-max 420</ENAMEX>) did not differ with regard to
          educational level, social class or ethnicity from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in the larger study who were not asked about
          attitudes/breastfeeding information. The questions on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information were added at a stage when a
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> already had entered the study, hence the
          smaller number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> answering questions about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> declined to participate, mainly because of
          insufficient ability to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 13 and 45 years of age</TIMEX> (mean
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.6 ± 5.9</NUMEX> (standard deviation; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> of the
          total number were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>. Practically all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          were urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> and the majority were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The mean age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.3 ± 3.6</NUMEX> (SD) months
          (median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX>), with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> below the age of one
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX>), and fewer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 10 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>), or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Interviews
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> interviewed all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and filled in
          the questionnaires in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interpreter</ENAMEX> was used.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were interviewed as they entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          or in some cases while waiting for a visit with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s attitude to breastfeeding was evaluated
          by posing the question "What is your opinion about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">breastfeeding?</ENAMEX>". The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was then offered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          alternatives presented in a random order (very bad, bad,
          neutral, good, very good). When asked to describe the
          attitudes of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were
          offered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> alternatives in random order (negative,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indifferent</ENAMEX>, positive or "do not know").
          Hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the mother's social
          network were not determined directly, but were reported
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> based on her perceptions of their
          attitudes. Information about breastfeeding was assessed
          by posing the question "Have you received information
          about the advantages of breastfeeding from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nurse</ENAMEX>, other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, television, radio
          or newspapers/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>/books?" If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> gave a
          positive answer regarding any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, she was
          then asked if and when she had first received
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and was given
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> alternatives: "before the birth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>", "on
          the maternity ward" or "after leaving the maternity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ward</ENAMEX>".
        
        
          Definitions
          Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving
          anything else besides breast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> at the time of the
          interview. The maximum intake of non-breast milk fluid in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX> that was allowed in this definition of
          exclusive breastfeeding was set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cucharillas
          (teaspoons) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 cuchara</NUMEX> (larger spoon) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> fluid
          ounce. Except for this amount of fluid and for prelacteal
          food, the absence of previous complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (or
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplementary fluids</ENAMEX> than the above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> amount)
          since birth was demanded for proof of exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>. In those cases where the weekly intake of
          food/fluid could not be specified, the end of exclusive
          breastfeeding was set at the date of introduction of the
          food/fluid in question. The provision of vitamins did not
          preclude exclusive breastfeeding. Hence the definition of
          exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from
          that suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labbok et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . In all analyses
          of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper, a "since
          birth" perspective has been used. "Any breastfeeding"
          included exclusive, predominant and partial breastfeeding
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          Colostrum was defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> produced in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days after</TIMEX> delivery. Prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was
          defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> before breastfeeding
          had been initiated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics</ENAMEX>
          The study was approved by the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> after they were informed about its
          content and objectives. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> gave their
          informed consent. The interviews were conducted without
          the identities of the interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> being recorded
          or revealed.
        
        
          Statistics
          The statistics program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">StatView 5.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used for analysis of the data.
          The significance level was set at p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>, with
          exceptions described below. In all regression analyses,
          the number of independent variables was lower than the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>/10 as recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Independent variables were dichotomized in order to
          generate odds ratios and hazard ratios. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> were
          divided according to median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><25 yr</NUMEX>. or ≥ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 yr.</NUMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX>), educational level <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">(≤</ENAMEX> 5 years of education
          vs. ><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</NUMEX>) and religious affiliation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> vs. non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five years</TIMEX> of
          education meant not having entered the "intermedio" stage
          of education (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolivian</ENAMEX> education is divided according to
          the stages "basico" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>, "intermedio" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX>,
          "medio" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 years</TIMEX>, and then university studies). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
          class was assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> on the basis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s answers to the socioeconomic questions, her
          language and appearance, the work of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and her
          area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> (lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150, middle 267</TIMEX>, upper <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>). The
          results of the social class assessment were based on an
          overall assessment, and not on a weighting of the
          variables. In the regression analyses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle</ENAMEX> and upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were analyzed together in
          comparison with lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class mothers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who failed
          to read a sentence out loud in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life)
          were classified as illiterate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25/493</NUMEX>). In this study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin ethnicity</ENAMEX> indicates <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ancestry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">191</NUMEX>),
          while native ethnicity is predominant in the indigenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX>). A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were of mixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, but were nevertheless classified as either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>. Work was defined as gainful employment
          yielding an income (on a regular basis). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> were not
          asked to specify the duration of their work.
        
        
          Determinants of maternal attitudes towards
          breastfeeding
          When studying determinants of maternal attitudes
          towards breastfeeding, univariate analyses of attitude
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> independent variables were first carried out
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). All independent variables with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX>
          were included in a multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (initial model, see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Elimination of non-significant variables was
          then undertaken using backward stepwise logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> until all remaining independent variables had
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> (Final model, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In the initial
          model, educational level, but not literacy, was kept in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, since the two variables were regarded as
          similar. The 
          backward stepwise mode was used to
          avoid exclusion of non-significant variables that
          affected the model fitness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Factors associated with the timing of breastfeeding
          information
          For each source of information, odds ratios or hazard
          ratios were calculated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> circumstances: (A)"any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information vs. no breastfeeding
          information" and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)"breastfeeding information before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">birth</ENAMEX> vs. breastfeeding information after birth or no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> informed for the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on the maternity ward were excluded in "B"). In the
          case of health-care-related information and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>-mediated information, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also presents
          determinants for (C) "breastfeeding information given
          before birth or on the maternity ward vs. after the
          maternity ward or no information received". <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX>
          independent variables were correlated with each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, urban/rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>,
          religious affiliation, social class, ethnicity,
          educational level, work, living with the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>)
          (data in this section were obtained be means of
          univariate analyses). In order to minimize the risk of
          mass significance, a modified Bonferroni correction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n/</ENAMEX>number of comparisons) was applied to this section of
          the results, and only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00625</NUMEX> were regarded
          statistically significant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, there are
          results with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval for odds ratios
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI OR</ENAMEX>) not including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX> that are 
          not presented.
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00625</NUMEX> was also used to assess
          statistical significance in the analyses of knowledge
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about breastfeeding</TIMEX>.

            The main purpose of the analyses in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4and</ENAMEX> 7was
            to study the association between attitude/breastfeeding
            information and feeding pattern, and not to create
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">predictive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for the feeding pattern (as opposed
            to the analyses of determinants of maternal attitude,
            see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Inclusion of non-significant variables in
            a regression model affects the adjusted difference (or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOR</ENAMEX>=<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Adjusted Odds Ratio</ENAMEX>) of other independent variables
            very little. The purpose of the analyses of feeding
            patterns was to present the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOR</ENAMEX> for one variable:
            attitude/information about breastfeeding. For that
            reason neither backward nor forward elimination of
            variables was carried out in these analyses; the AORs
            originate from the initial complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
            In all analyses of maternal attitude and feeding
            pattern, the attitudes "good" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX>) and "neutral"
            (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were collapsed into one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and then compared
            with " very good" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX>).
          
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Background data
          The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> had given their
          infant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colostrum</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> had been
          given prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Attitudes towards breastfeeding
          
            Maternal attitudes towards breastfeeding
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">502</NUMEX>) thought that
            breastfeeding was good (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.2 %</NUMEX>) or very good
            (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.6 %</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> regarded breastfeeding as
            neither good nor bad. Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with earlier
            experience with breastfeeding, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> claimed that
            breastfeeding was very good for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.7%</NUMEX>), as
            compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125/252</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.6%</NUMEX>) who had not
            breastfed before (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
            Univariate analyses showed a positive correlation
            between reporting that breastfeeding was "very good"
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the following variables: more than
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> of education (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX>/upper class
            background (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), and literacy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0019</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
            In a subsequent multivariate model there was a
            positive correlation between a very positive attitude
            towards breastfeeding and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> ethnicity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>; OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.32</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.14</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.13</NUMEX>) and

            Perceived attitude of family towards
            breastfeeding
            According to the interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> (the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of the infant) were most often positive towards
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">422/446</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.6%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> reported
            that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> was negative towards
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>.
            Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">447</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> were reported to be
            positive (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90.8%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> negative towards
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Attitude and feeding pattern
            With the exception of a positive association between
            the attitude of the breastfeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister/brother</ENAMEX> towards breastfeeding and the use of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colostrum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0468</NUMEX>; OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.57</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR =
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.50</NUMEX>), there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between the
            attitudes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and the
            studied outcomes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The correlation between use
            of colostrum and the attitude of the mother's
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister/brother</ENAMEX> disappeared when data were adjusted for
            place of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, ethnicity, work and educational
            level.
          
        
        
          Knowledge about breastfeeding
          The advantages of breastfeeding were well known, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92.6%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">461/498</NUMEX>) mentioned at least one
          advantage. Most frequently mentioned were nutrition
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">318/498</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.9%</NUMEX>), defense against infectious diseases
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">309/498</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.0%</NUMEX>), and practical aspects (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">73/498</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.7%</NUMEX>).
          Economic factors (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35/498</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.0%</NUMEX>) and breastfeeding as a
          means of enhancing contact between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> were
          also pointed out (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18/498</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6%</NUMEX>).
          Knowledge about advantages of breastfeeding were
          linked to educational level (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of education: p
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>; OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.19</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.57</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.41</NUMEX>), middle

          these factors and adding urban residence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0265</NUMEX>; OR
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.24</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.17</NUMEX>) in a regression analysis,
          only educational level remained statistically significant
          with regard to knowledge about breastfeeding advantages.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five years</TIMEX> of education were more
          often able to mention at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who were able to mention at least one
          advantage of breastfeeding had been informed about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> to a greater extent than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          (information from anyone, from a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, from television, from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>/books).
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did not report any disadvantages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">448/491</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91.2 %</NUMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifteen mothers</ENAMEX>
          mentioned transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX>) said breastfeeding made it difficult for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to work outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.

            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">386/420</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had been informed about

            Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">420</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.5 %</NUMEX>) had received
            information about breastfeeding from either a 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> before the
            birth of the infant. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were first

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> had been informed by a 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> before the birth of their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. The most common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of information about
            breastfeeding before birth were television (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">303/420</NUMEX>)
            and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">280/420</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Factors associated with the timing of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five years</TIMEX> of education, of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ethnicity or with a middle/upper class background
            were in general more often informed about breastfeeding
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). This was true irrespective of the timing of
            information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> living in urban areas and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
            living with the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> also reported having
            been informed about breastfeeding more often than other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Adjusting for multiple comparisons, no
            independent variable correlated with breastfeeding
            information from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>, a neighbor or the radio.
          
          
            Mode of providing information
            The predominant mode of breastfeeding information
            provided by health care was verbal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">313/418</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74.9 %</NUMEX>),
            while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">418</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> had been informed through
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pamphlets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.3%</NUMEX>). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> of information
            included films/videos (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74/418</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.7 %</NUMEX>) and posters
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33/418</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9%</NUMEX>).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information and feeding
            pattern
            Information about breastfeeding, irrespective of
            source and time relationship to the birth, was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with avoidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal foods</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). When adjusting for pre-specified confounders, use

            who had received initial breastfeeding information
            before the infant's birth or on the maternity ward (vs.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information given before birth or on

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctor-mediated</ENAMEX> breastfeeding information given

        Discussion
        
          Strengths and weaknesses of the study
          All the interviews in this study were conducted by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, and this should have ensured a consistent
          technique and interpretation of the answers. A number of
          interviews were interrupted, and certain questions were
          not answered by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The interruptions occurred at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and were not limited to a certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">socioeconomic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, bias cannot be
          excluded, and the results should be interpreted with
          caution. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in the urban
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vaccination</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          . Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> visits of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were for
          the purpose of regular check-ups and vaccinations, a
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were seen because of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Hence, in
          the present study, bias in the sample cannot be excluded.
          There is a risk that the reasons for the visits were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with feeding patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          may also have been worried, and the fact that such
          feelings may have affected the reliability of their
          answers cannot be excluded.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>
          and the mother's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> were reported by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. These answers may have differed from the true
          opinions of the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, etc. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          . However, it seems unlikely that such discrepancies have
          affected the results, since maternal feeding behavior is
          influenced by what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> perceives as the attitude
          of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> or of her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and
          ethnicity were assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>. No weighting was
          used. The use of a formal index for social status, such
          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollingshead</ENAMEX> (ISP) Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Position</ENAMEX>, would
          have improved the study.
          The intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> teaspoons of fluid per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> and
          the use of prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> were allowed under the
          definition of exclusive breastfeeding in the present
          paper. An average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than half a teaspoon</NUMEX> a day of
          fluid would not be expected to contribute to the actual
          nutrition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and was hence accepted in the
          definition of exclusive breastfeeding. At the time of
          study, the WHO accepted drops and syrups in their
          definition of exclusive breastfeeding (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>who.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">int/child-adolescent-health/New_Publications/NUTRITION/who_cdd_ser</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">91.14.PDF</ENAMEX>).
          It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s impression that prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> were
          seldom given for nutritional reasons, but rather as a
          matter of tradition.
          This was a cross-sectional and retrospective study,
          not a clinical trial, and for that reason the content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information was not checked. In a recent
          study from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the majority of
          pediatricians were unfamiliar with the content of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> did not make specific recommendations on
          the duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Any strategy
          aiming to decrease the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal foods</ENAMEX> and to
          increase the use of colostrum and the duration of
          exclusive breastfeeding must take both the timing and the
          content of breastfeeding information into consideration.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were asked at what stage they had first been
          informed about breastfeeding. This means that the extent
          to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> answering "before birth" had also
          received information on the maternity ward, or after
          leaving the maternity ward, is uncertain. The fact that
          duration of exclusive breastfeeding, use of colostrum,
          and avoidance of prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> were linked to
          health-care-related "information before birth or on the
          maternity ward", but not to "before birth", may indicate
          that we should focus our efforts on informing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> breastfeeding on the maternity ward. Future studies
          may choose to approach the issue of timing in a different
          manner.
          The same potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounders</ENAMEX> were used in all
          regression analyses of the relationship between attitudes
          towards and information about breastfeeding and feeding
          pattern. This was done in order to inhibit the risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> torturing. This study was based on interview data.
          Feeding data have not been confirmed through direct
          observation or other validation, and there is an obvious
          risk of recall bias. However, the data on the rate of
          exclusive breastfeeding at various ages, for example,
          show a good correlation with those from the preceding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> not shown)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Main findings
          Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> thought breastfeeding was good or
          very good. This is not surprising, since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> spontaneously mentioned the nutritional and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunological</ENAMEX> properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> when asked if
          they knew of any advantages of breastfeeding. According
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> of cases the infant's
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> were both positive toward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin ethnicity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX>/upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class mothers</ENAMEX> were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more likely than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to report that
          breastfeeding was "very good". This could either be due
          to better knowledge of breastfeeding advantages or to a
          different use of language. In this study both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX>/upper class background were strongly
          linked to having been informed about breastfeeding by
          someone, and both variables correlated with mentioning
          advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> factor of seeming
          importance regarding access to information was level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. Educational level was also the only remaining
          independent variable in a stepwise regression analysis of
          determinants for knowledge of breastfeeding advantages.
          In richer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, a high educational level may
          translate into longer breastfeeding duration.
          The data did not support a link between attitude of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and duration of exclusive breastfeeding.
          Maternal attitude has otherwise been shown to be an
          important predictor of the breastfeeding decision [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX>
          ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for the surprising results may be that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ethnicity, although linked to a very positive
          attitude towards breastfeeding, has also been linked to a
          shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). In many developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
          lower breastfeeding rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason could
          be the way "attitude" was defined in the present study.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] describe "attitude" as
          "intention to breastfeed", while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] define it as feeding preference. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> reason
          could be the measurement of maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>. A
          multiattribute utility questionnaire, such as the one
          used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dungy et al.</ENAMEX>, might have yielded different
          results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          No breastfeeding parameter correlated with the
          attitude of the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, and this
          is in contrast to studies from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 12 36</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> in this study
          were reported to be positive toward breastfeeding, and
          the lack of "negative or neutral attitudes" towards
          breastfeeding diminishes the chances to link attitude to
          feeding behavior. Lay support for breastfeeding probably
          results in a longer duration of exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . It must, however, be emphasized that the cited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] was based
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">randomized</ENAMEX> and quasi-randomized trials in which even
          lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> had undergone breastfeeding
          counseling/lactation management courses. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> may have an
          influence on feeding decisions because of their emotional
          importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, it is unlikely that they will
          exert much effect through the transmission of facts.
          Hence, the results of the present study do not support
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] in their recommendation that
          information be targeted not only at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> but also at
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>. Such measures may not
          influence infant feeding patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-three</NUMEX> percent of 
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the present study
          reported that health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> had informed them
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about breastfeeding</TIMEX>. This figure offers a different
          perspective than studies reviewing the extent to which 
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> claim to take
          up issues concerning breastfeeding with pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] .
          The unequal distribution of health care-mediated
          information found among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> indicates a
          structural problem, especially since only information
          mediated by health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor/nurse</ENAMEX>) influenced the actual duration of exclusive
          breastfeeding, and the use of prelacteal food and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colostrum</ENAMEX>. The correlation between professional
          information/support and exclusive breastfeeding duration
          is in line with a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane</ENAMEX> report in which the
          relative risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding before
          the final study assessment was significantly lower among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> receiving professional support (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI relative
          risk = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          The use of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal foods
          are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cornerstones</ENAMEX> in early infant nutrition and may be
          prerequisites for the establishment of future exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX> must be made available to enable
          health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to inform all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>. This is especially important in a poor
          area of the world where the prevalence of gastroenteritis
          is high [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Numerous studies have shown a protective
          effect of breastfeeding in relation to infectious
          diarrhea [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 40</ENAMEX> ] .
          On the basis of this study it is reasonable to
          advocate that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>, breastfeeding information
          should be supplied before birth or perhaps even more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, on the maternity ward. Intervention with
          antenatal breastfeeding support seems to have less effect
          on breastfeeding rates than trials offering only
          postnatal support [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In that context, the
          observation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reiff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] that health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> may exert a stronger influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>'
          infant-feeding practices with nonverbal teaching (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> "modeling" of infant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula products</ENAMEX>) than with
          verbal teaching is important. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Breastfeeding</ENAMEX> promotion
          programs on a maternity ward setting should include more
          than just verbal information; e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rooming</ENAMEX>-in,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> assistance and talks during
          hospitalization. The maternity ward may also provide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with a place to exchange ideas and experiences
          among themselves as well as to solve breastfeeding
          problems.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> information delivered by health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in a non-trial setting may influence the infant
        feeding pattern including the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal foods</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colostrum</ENAMEX>. This study does not present any evidence
        indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infant</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> influence actual feeding
        behavior. However, this is a cross-sectional and
        retrospective study with a risk for recall bias, and data
        need to be confirmed in a longitudinal study in which the
        timing and content of the information are taken into
        consideration.
