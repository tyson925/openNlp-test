        Although conflicting findings about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone mineral</ENAMEX> density
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> have been reported,
        there are substantial data which support the notion that
        type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rotterdam</ENAMEX> Study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], which involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,931</NUMEX>
        subjects, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">243</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">355</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, provides the most convincing evidence. They found
        that diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> independent
        of age, obesity, the use of estrogen, thiazide, or loop
        diuretics, impairment in the ability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living, and
        smoking [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia has been
        reported to be associated with an increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> in diabetic
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and non-diabetic subjects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rancho</ENAMEX>
        Bernardo Study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting insulin</ENAMEX> was
        significantly and positively associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> in
        non-diabetic female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, where each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼U/ml increase
        in fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> level was associated with an increase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/cm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2in</ENAMEX> the radius and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/cm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2in</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spine</ENAMEX>. However, no independent association between fasting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> level and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Since
        fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> level is an indicator of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance, it is tempting to hypothesize that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance (decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity) is associated
        with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> is known to have strong genetic determinants. Our
        understanding of the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> is based on a twin study of serum osteocalcin
        level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The synthesis of osteocalcin, the most abundant
        non-collageous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, is induced by calcitriol
        (the active form of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX>. Since a
        variation in serum osteocalcin level was shown to have a
        strong genetic component mediated through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX>, the
        relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> polymorphisms and serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteocalcin</ENAMEX> level was found. Furthermore, this relationship
        was shown to be independent of age or menopausal effect [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. Subsequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene polymorphisms were found to
        account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the total genetic effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> in
        healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However, to date there are more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> studies on the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About half</NUMEX> of the studies found
        a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> found no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The most convincing evidence comes from a
        study of peak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> in a group of pre-pubertal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>],
        which confirms the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>.
        Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> is expressed in tissues, namely muscle and
        pancreatic islets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], which are involved in
        the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose metabolism</ENAMEX>, we hypothesized that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene could play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose metabolism</ENAMEX>. In
        this study, we examined the role of the 
        Fok I polymorphism in the translation
        initiation codon of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> healthy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tolerant Caucasians</ENAMEX> who underwent a standard oral glucose
        tolerance test. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> and beta cell
        function were estimated using a homeostasis model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HOMA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. We found that the 
        Fok I polymorphism is associated with
        insulin resistance in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Characteristics of the study population
          Since hypertension is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], only those with normal blood pressure
          (systolic blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 140</NUMEX> mmHg and diastolic
          blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 90 mmHg</NUMEX>) were enrolled into the
          study. Because we were also concerned about the effect of
          glucose toxicity on beta cell function and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          sensitivity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> underwent a standard
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-gm oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance test. Only those subjects
          with a fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> level less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> mM,
          interval plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels (at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 11.1</NUMEX> mM, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> plasma glucose
          level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 7.8</NUMEX> mM were enrolled in this study.
          This study included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, of
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> were female. Clinical features of the subjects
          were: mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 28 years old</TIMEX> (range: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19-39 years</TIMEX>), mean
          body mass index <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24.26 kg</NUMEX>/cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17.58-34.26 kg</NUMEX>/cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), mean
          waist-hip ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cm</ENAMEX>/cm (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cm</ENAMEX>/cm), mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> mmHg (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">94-135 mmHg</NUMEX>), mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67 mmHg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53-83</NUMEX> mmHg), mean
          fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> level <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.71 mM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.88</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.54</NUMEX> mM), mean
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> post challenged plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.40</NUMEX> mM
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.34</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.66</NUMEX> mM), mean <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-minute</TIMEX> post challenged plasma
          glucose level <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.09 mM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.79</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.20</NUMEX> mM), mean <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post</ENAMEX> challenged plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> level <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.30 mM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.12</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.02</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>), and mean <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> post challenged plasma glucose
          level <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.71 mM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.94</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.60</NUMEX> mM).
        
        
          Genotype, phenotype, and biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>
          After genotyping, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ff</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the allele
          frequency was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> for the f
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>. The distribution of genotypes was in compliance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.873</NUMEX>). Since only
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 ff</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were identified, they were pooled with the
          Ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ff/ff</ENAMEX>) had compatible
          gender distribution, age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, systolic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure, fasting lipid profiles and
          fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, the
          Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a higher mean waist-hip ratio and a
          higher mean fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma insulin</ENAMEX> level, compared to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.042</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006</NUMEX>, respectively). These
          results indicate that the Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are more obese
          and more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistant than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
          Beta cell function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>)
          were estimated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HOMA</ENAMEX> based on the average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels before
          the oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance test. No difference was noted
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.23</NUMEX>). However, there was
          a drastic difference in %S between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
          (p=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006</NUMEX>). After an oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> load (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the
          Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had similar plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels at each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. However, the
          Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had higher postchallenged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at 30, 60</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.049</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.041</NUMEX>, respectively). Furthermore, the
          Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> area under the curve
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>). These results again
          indicate that the Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          resistant than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Stepwise regression analysis
          Various covariates have been shown to affect either
          beta cell function or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> or both. To
          examine the influence of the available covariates in
          addition to the 
          Fok I polymorphism on beta cell
          function and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, we employed a stepwise
          regression analytical approach. Age, gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass
          index, waist-hip ratio, and systolic and diastolic blood
          pressure were entered into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and a backward
          stepwise regression analysis was performed. It revealed
          that the 
          Fok I polymorphism was an
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determinant</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>, but not for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          The 
          Fok I polymorphism, combined with
          waist-hip ratio, explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.3%</NUMEX> of the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">%S.</ENAMEX>
          This result confirms that this polymorphism is an
          independent risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We found that in healthy, normotensive Caucasian
        subjects with normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX>, the 
        Fok I polymorphism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the vitamin</TIMEX> D
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor gene</ENAMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2%</NUMEX> of the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>,
        but had no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B.</ENAMEX> Although the Ff/ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
        more obese than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.042</NUMEX> for waist-hip
        ratio), the difference in %S between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        decreased after adjusting for waist-hip ratio (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.50</NUMEX> vs.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.69</TIMEX> before and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.52</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX> after adjusting for waist-hip
        ratio). However, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymorphism</ENAMEX> remained an independent
        determinant for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>S after adjusting for waist-hip ratio
        (p=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.039</NUMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Therefore, we concluded that the 
        Fok I polymorphism was a risk factor
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance, independent of obesity.
        The allelic frequencies of the present study (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> for
        the F allele and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> for the f allele) are very similar to
        the reported frequencies in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> for the F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> for the f allele) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> for
        the F allele and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> for the f allele) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. In the present study, we pooled the ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        Ff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> for its small sample size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 ff</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ff</ENAMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 FF</TIMEX>). To examine whether there is a difference among the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, we examined the influence of
        genotypes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>. We found a significant
        difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.016</NUMEX>) and again no difference in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B
        (p=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.408</NUMEX>). However, no difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> was noted between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ff</ENAMEX> and ff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.159</NUMEX>). The main difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>
        is between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX>). Although we
        cannot exclude the possibility of inadequate power to
        detect the difference from the present sample size, this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> is consistent with the functional study of the 
        Fok I polymorphism in cultured human
        peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. In this
        functional study, they compared the inhibitory effect of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> on the growth of cultured human
        peripheral mononuclear cells isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        different 
        Fok I genotypes and found significant
        differences among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genotypes, but found no
        difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ff</ENAMEX> and ff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> is well known to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In the present study, we also found that
        the 
        Fok I polymorphism was associated
        with obesity assessed by waist-hip ratio but not by body
        mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, the association between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ff/ff</ENAMEX> genotypes with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and obesity
        prompted us to further examine the interaction among this
        polymorphism, obesity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance. Multivariate
        analysis revealed that this polymorphism had no independent
        impact on waist-hip ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1468</NUMEX>) after adjustment for
        age (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0203</NUMEX>), gender (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0007</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), while systolic and diastolic blood pressure
        had also no impact on waist-hip ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5549</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3806</NUMEX>, respectively). However, from the multivariate
        analysis result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), we concluded that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> had an important impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, which was independent of the influence of
        waist-hip ratio. Although gender was excluded as an
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">covariate</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>S in the present study after
        adjustment for waist-hip ratio, which was affected by
        gender, the interaction between gender and this
        polymorphism, if any, needs to be addressed in a study with
        a much larger sample size.
        The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VDR gene polymorphisms</ENAMEX> has been examined in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, however their roles in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> have not been examined. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, transmission
        disequilibrium testing analysis demonstrated the
        preferential transmission of the "b" allele of the 
        Bsm I polymorphism to affected
        subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. However, it was less certain for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Taq I and</ENAMEX> 
        Apa I polymorphisms in this sample
        set. Nonetheless, this study indicates that the 
        Bsm I polymorphism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> is a risk factor of type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. In a study of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, there was an
        excessive transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bT</ENAMEX> and bAT extended haplotypes to
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> but no evidence of excessive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Taq I and</ENAMEX> 
        Apa I alleles alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Recently,
        we confirmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of this marker with type 1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. These studies in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> indicate that the 
        Bsm I polymorphism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        locus confers susceptibility to type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The study
        of type 2 diabetes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bangladesh Asians</ENAMEX> who were at risk for type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of them were either diabetic or impaired glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerant</ENAMEX>. An association between the 
        Apa I polymorphism and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> index was noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. These studies suggest that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene locus is a genetic marker for both type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
        type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        Since the 
        Bsm I polymorphism is located in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intron 7</ENAMEX>, the 
        Apa I polymorphism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intron 8</TIMEX>, and
        the 
        Taq I polymorphism in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene, they are less
        likely to have any biological consequences in causing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose metabolism</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        functional studies of these polymorphisms show no clearly
        demonstrable difference among them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-to-C transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> at the translation
        initiation codon of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VDR gene</ENAMEX> not only destroys a 
        Fok I site but also abolishes the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> translation initiation codon of this gene. The
        alternative translation initiation codon, which also
        adheres the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> rule by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kozak</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], is located
        downstream by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In the present study, we
        examined the 
        Fok I polymorphism, which not only
        affects the translation of the peptide, but also affects
        the biological activity tested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hela Cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-to-C transition resulted in the synthesis of a smaller (F
        allele, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> less than the f allele) protein
        with increased vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. In addition, the different response to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is also demonstrated in cultured
        human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        different 
        Fok I genotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. We found that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with homozygous F allele had increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        sensitivity compared to those with the f allele.
        Although the molecular basis of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is
        unclear, the study of the relationship between the level of
        vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] provides some insight
        to the underlying mechanism. Glucose tolerance and vitamin
        D level were assessed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dutchmen</ENAMEX>. Fasting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and postchallenged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels decreased with
        increased vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. As a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> level
        is a surrogate for decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> suggests that a higher vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> level is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>. Since
        vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> binds to the vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> receptor to initiate the
        downstream action, a higher vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> level would lead to
        an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vitamin</TIMEX> D-dependent transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Our observation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> alleles (associated with an increased
        activity) are more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitive than those with the f
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> is consistent with the notion above.
        Our original hypothesis was that the allele, which is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>, was also associated with
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance. However,
        since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> allele is associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>], our observation of the association between the F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> and increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> is not consistent
        with our original hypothesis. On the other hand, not all
        reports support the association between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> and
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. Nonetheless, our observation shows
        that this polymorphism is an independent determinant for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> and is in agreement with the notion
        that a higher level of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is associated with
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Furthermore additional
        studies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> and other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are
        required.
        In the present study, we report an association between a
        polymorphism at the translation initiation codon of the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VDR gene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerant
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">normotensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasians</ENAMEX>. This polymorphism is an
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determinant</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, explaining
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2%</NUMEX> of the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> and with waist-hip ratio,
        explaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.3%</NUMEX> of the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">%S.</ENAMEX> Although the
        speculated mechanism of our observation is in agreement
        with the published association between vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> levels and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, further studies are required to
        confirm our observation in other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as well as
        in another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. To explore the underlying
        molecular basis of the 
        Fok I polymorphism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> gene
        locus, as well as the association between vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> level
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, also warrants further study.
      
      
        Subjects, materials and methods
        
          Study subjects
          We confirm that the study has complied with the
          recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Helsinki</ENAMEX>. The study
          was approved by the institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> and a
          written informed consent was obtained from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> at the beginning of the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were
          recruited through an advertisement on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> media of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. Only healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were invited to
          participate in this study. They were prescreened via
          telephone and confirmed again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the visit.
          They were biologically unrelated.
        
        
          Oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance test and physical
          examination
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were instructed to fast for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 14 hours</TIMEX>
          before the study visit. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of the visit, an
          indwelling angiocatheter was inserted into an antecubital
          vein. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> drawn at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-5 minutes</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, lipid measurement and genomic DNA
          isolation. Fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels were
          calculated as the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fasting samples. After
          the oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gm glucose</ENAMEX>, postchallenged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were drawn at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> measurements. A limited physical
          examination was performed on all study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>,
          including measurements of weight, height, waist, hip, and
          blood pressure. After resting quietly for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive measurements of systolic and diastolic
          blood pressures were taken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> apart, and the
          average of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measurements was reported.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction and genotyping of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fok I</ENAMEX>
          polymorphism
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes
          as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
          flanking the 
          Fok I polymorphism was amplified
          using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primers flanking exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGCTGGCCCTGGCACTGCTCTGCTCT</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATGGAAACACCTTGCTTCTTCTCCCTC</ENAMEX>. Polymerase chain reaction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>) was carried out in a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> pM of each primer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> dimethysulphoxide (DMSO), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.275</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.001%</NUMEX> gelatin. The region of interest was amplified by
          an initial denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> cycles
          of denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, annealing at 60Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, and extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, and
          concluded with a final extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
          Then, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">265</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs) was
          digested in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-Î¼l</NUMEX> of reaction volume containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U of</ENAMEX>

          the vender. The digested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were resolved on
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0%</NUMEX> agarose gels. 
          Fok I digested the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ATG and
          yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> products, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69 and 196</TIMEX> base pairs (f allele),
          while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> to C transition destroyed the 
          Fok I site (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> allele).
        
        
          Statistical analysis

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used for statistical
          analysis. Variables with skewed distributions were
          logarithmically transformed before analysis. The
          variables transformed were body mass index, waist-hip
          ratio, plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> area under the
          curve, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S. Data</ENAMEX> were presented as mean (or
          geometric means when appropriate) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, unless otherwise specified. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-sided t-tests
          or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> tests were used to evaluate the differences
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. To determine the interaction of
          the genotype of interest with the other covariates, a
          stepwise regression analysis was performed with a
          backward option and an alpha-to-remove or alpha-to-enter
          setting at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>. The covariates with the highest p value
          were removed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at a time, until all the remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX> had a p value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>.
