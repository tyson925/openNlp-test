        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> is common among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwestern European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peoples</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX>. This disorder is typically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with homozygosity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C282Y</TIMEX> mutation of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HFE gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2, nt 845 G→A</ENAMEX>) on Ch6p
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . C282Y lies within an ancestral haplotype which
        includes the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocyte antigen</ENAMEX> (HLA) haplotype
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The ancestral haplotype is the
        predominant hemochromatosis-associated haplotype in many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwestern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . This is attributed to the origin of the
        C282Y mutation on an A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotype in northwestern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and its early dissemination by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        Modification of the ancestral chromosome by recombination
        and admixture as a result of geographic migration explains
        the occurrence of chromosomes bearing C282Y in association
        with different HLA haplotypes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 8 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Thus
        some non-ancestral haplotypes also occur with significantly
        increased frequencies in hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and in descendants of Europeans
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 16</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, phenotype frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> alleles
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis and in control populations
        have been reported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotype frequencies for hemochromatosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> have been
        reported only from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The purpose of the present
        work was to quantify and analyze the frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A
        and -B alleles and haplotypes in hemochromatosis probands
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, and to compare
        the present results to those reported in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> and Methods
        
          Selection of subjects
          
            Hemochromatosis probands
            The performance of this work was approved by the
            Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center</ENAMEX>
            and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Alabama</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX>. A
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">presumptive</ENAMEX> diagnosis of hemochromatosis was
            established using an elevated transferrin saturation
            criterion; each proband was subsequently evaluated for
            iron overload and its complications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . All
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probands</ENAMEX> in the present study were white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years of age</TIMEX>). Probands were included who had: a)
            diagnosis of hemochromatosis in routine medical care
            during the interval <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 - 2001</TIMEX>; b) C282Y <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX>;
            c) available HLA-A and -B typing; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central Alabama</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> declined to undergo 
            HFE mutation analysis after it
            was determined that he/she had a hemochromatosis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. There were A and B typing data in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haplotypes</ENAMEX> could not be determined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>
            probands due to similarities in alleles of probands and
            family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, or due to unavailability of family
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for analysis. Thus, there were haplotype data
            on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> probands.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> subjects
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,321</NUMEX> apparently normal, unrelated white
            adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> who had undergone A and B
            phenotype analysis as part of paternity testing were
            used to estimate allele and gene frequencies [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ;
            R.T. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acton</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations]. A and B
            haplotypes were determined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">605</NUMEX> unrelated white
            subjects from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
            and/or putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>) who had undergone testing to
            establish paternity.
          
        
        
          Laboratory methods
          Serum iron concentration, transferrin saturation, and
          serum ferritin concentration were measured using
          automated clinical methods. Sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> biopsy
          specimens were stained using hematoxylin and eosin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX>'s trichrome, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perls' Prussian</ENAMEX> blue techniques;
          intrahepatocytic iron was graded according to the method
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheuer et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          
          HFE mutation analysis was performed
          as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were
          detected using low-resolution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based typing
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>/sequence-specific oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) in probands
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were tested using the
          microdroplet lymphocytotoxicity test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ; subjects
          were evaluated using antisera that detected allele
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignments</ENAMEX> described in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> thInternational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histocompatibility Workshop</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Because the levels
          of resolution of the DNA-based and serological typing
          methods we used are similar, alleles detected by these
          respective methods provide concordant allele assignments,
          with the exception of B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> that were not
          detected by serological methods. 
          HFE mutation analysis and HLA
          typing of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were performed to permit
          assignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch6p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">haplotypes</ENAMEX>. In each proband in whom a
          single A or B allele was detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based typing, we
          verified the allele(s) and set phase to ascertain
          haplotypes of the proband using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> analyses of appropriate
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. For the present analysis, all haplotypes
          were defined only by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and B alleles, and the ancestral
          haplotype was defined as a hemochromatosis-associated
          Ch6p bearing A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Literature review
          For most comparisons, recent tabulations of A and B
          allele <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> case-control studies from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thirteen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and A and B haplotype analyses in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> or regions were used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . We also
          made computerized and manual searches to identify
          estimates of the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX> in
          hemochromatosis cases in various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> or regions for
          which A and B haplotype data were also available.
        
        
          Statistical considerations
          A data set that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> types in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> probands and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> probands was available. Absolute or
          "uncorrected" values of A and B phenotype frequencies in
          probands, respective frequencies of A and B genes, A and
          B haplotype frequencies, and occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-haplotype
          combinations were calculated after enumeration of the raw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Some previously reported hemochromatosis-associated
          HLA broad specificities are designated herein as
          corresponding splits (A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">09</TIMEX> = A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> and A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>; B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">05</TIMEX> = B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>
          and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>; and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> and B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>, respectively) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
          . A computer spreadsheet (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel 2000</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>) and a statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GB-Stat</ENAMEX>, v. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamic Microsystems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Spring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) were
          used to perform the present analyses. Frequency values
          were compared using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test, as appropriate. A value of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.05</ENAMEX> was defined as
          significant, and these values were expressed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          significant figures. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s correction for
          multiple tests was not performed because many of the HLA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis reported herein have
          been described elsewhere.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Hemochromatosis probands
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> ages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51 ± 4 years</TIMEX> (mean ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 ± 5 years</TIMEX>. Iron overload was
          detected using serum ferritin concentration, hepatic iron
          index, or quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phlebotomy</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> probands; three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had no evidence of iron overload.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> probands (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) had hepatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> demonstrated by hepatic biopsy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probands</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirteen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.
          Cardiomyopathy attributable to iron overload was not
          diagnosed in any proband.
        
        
          Phenotype frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>-A and -B
          alleles
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> A alleles were detected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> probands
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Sixteen A alleles were detected in control
          subjects. The most frequent A alleles in probands were
          A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">02</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3021</NUMEX>), A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.7482</NUMEX>), and A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1007</NUMEX>). The
          frequency of A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX> was greater in probands than in control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjects</ENAMEX> (

          lower frequencies in probands than in control subjects
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) [ Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. Because arthropathy is
          common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , we
          compared the frequencies of B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> in probands and control

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A*03 positivity</TIMEX> was detected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 74%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>
        C282Y <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygous</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis probands in the present
        study. Similarly, the frequency of A<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">*03 positivity</TIMEX> was
        significantly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis probands
        diagnosed before the discovery of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . These observations are
        consistent with and extend the findings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> previously
        reported case-controlled studies from thirteen countries
        which demonstrate the significantly increased prevalence of
        A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The alleles

        of 
        HFE than in corresponding control
        subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The present analysis demonstrates that
        this is attributable largely to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> and
        B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> with A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX>, consistent with observations in persons
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from many locations,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brittany</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 32 33 34</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>

        The frequency of the ancestral haplotype defined by
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> in the present <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> is greater than
        that reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis reported from
        most other areas. It is possible that our method of
        selection of subjects for the present study could partly
        account for this. We selected only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> who had a
        hemochromatosis phenotype and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX>. Across
        other studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        hemochromatosis, criteria for definition of hemochromatosis
        phenotypes differed. Some studies included probands,
        whereas others included probands and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
        with hemochromatosis; some required demonstration of
        segregation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes, and others did not [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] . None used 
        HFE mutation analysis as an inclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> as we required in the present study. In several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwestern Europe</ENAMEX>, however, the percentage
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> in hemochromatosis case series is
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35 37 38</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queensland</ENAMEX>, a
        frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> homozygosity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> was reported among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> identified by phenotype criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
        the selection criterion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homozygosity</ENAMEX> in the
        present study nonetheless resulted in a group of
        hemochromatosis probands the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> genotypes of which are similar to
        those of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwestern European</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The present observations
        regarding this haplotype may be attributable to the large
        subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sicilian</ENAMEX> descent in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central Alabama</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . A significantly increased
        frequency of the haplotype A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> was observed in the
        present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis probands, whereas a
        relative increase in this haplotype was detected in
        hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brittany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> only after
        "correction" of the data for the preponderance of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 20</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly, a significantly increased
        frequency of the haplotype A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> was observed in the
        present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis probands, whereas a
        relative increase in this haplotype was detected in
        hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brittany</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> after
        "correction" of the data for the preponderance of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 8 19</NUMEX> ] . The absolute frequency of the
        haplotype A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> was increased in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>
        hemochromatosis probands, whereas a "corrected" frequency
        of A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> was increased in hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The other aforementioned haplotypes (except
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>) have not been reported to occur
        with increased frequency in any hemochromatosis cohort from
        locations other than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>. Thus, we observed a greater
        number of haplotypes which were significantly increased in
        frequency among the present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis
        probands than have been reported in other hemochromatosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, including a cohort in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This could
        be attributed to a greater degree of genetic heterogeneity
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, consistent with previous reports
        of genetic characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis
        in this geographic area [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 45</NUMEX> ] . Alternatively, we had
        greater power to achieve statistical significance in the
        present analyses than did some other studies. Nonetheless,
        the percentage of the present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> who were
        HLA-haploidentical with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other proband
        indicates that the haplotypes among hemochromatosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> are more restricted than those
        in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with hemochromatosis, the A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotype</ENAMEX> is not invariably associated with inheritance of
        C282Y. The frequency of the A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotype was
        significantly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> hemochromatosis probands
        without C282Y [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , some of whom had the common 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> missense mutation H63D [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotypes associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX> have also been
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with primary antibody
        deficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        hemochromatosis have an A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotype which includes
        the novel 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> missense mutation I105T [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] .
        Thus, a variety of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> missense mutations occur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotypes in white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabamians</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        A*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">03</TIMEX> and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> frequencies are increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>
        probands, like other hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>. Increased
        absolute frequencies of the haplotype A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> have been
        reported only in the present <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> and in
        hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. Increased absolute
        frequencies of A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
        A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>, A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>, and A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>
        were detected in the present cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>
        hemochromatosis probands, but these haplotypes have not
        been reported to occur with increased absolute frequency in
        other hemochromatosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Modification of the
        ancestral chromosome by recombination and admixture as a
        result of geographic migration could explain the previously
        undescribed occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> haplotypes that occur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C282Y</TIMEX>. These results could also be
        explained by the greater degree of genetic heterogeneity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white Alabamians</ENAMEX> than in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and by the
        larger numbers of probands and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and greater
        statistical power to demonstrate significant differences in
        the present study than in some similar previous studies. A
        variety of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFE</ENAMEX> missense mutations occur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with A*<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX>-B*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">07</TIMEX> haplotypes in white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabamians</ENAMEX>.
