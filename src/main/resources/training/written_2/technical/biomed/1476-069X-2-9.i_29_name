        This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reports on the experience of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that reduced their use of methylene
        chloride in a variety of industrial processes in response
        to increasing regulatory pressures. Rather than utilize the
        traditional control approaches delineated in environmental
        and occupational health regulation, such as pollution
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> equipment or local exhaust ventilation that
        facilitate the continued use of hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> chose a source reduction approach. Source
        reduction, also called pollution prevention, includes
        chemical substitution, process modification, and substitute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> that intervene in the industrial process
        itself to eliminate or reduce hazards. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] In the
        environmental protection field, awareness of pollution
        "media-shifting," e.g. protecting the air by filtering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contaminants</ENAMEX> through a filter that then becomes or collects
        hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX>, has given rise to support for pollution 
        prevention in place of "end-of-pipe"
        controls. In addition to private sector initiatives, many
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have
        established source reduction as a preferred environmental
        policy and have dedicated resources to promote it. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Danish</ENAMEX>
        law has since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> prohibiting the use of hazardous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> if safer substitutes are available. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pollution Prevention Act of 1990</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Toxics Use Reduction Act</ENAMEX> have helped to
        "mainstream" source reduction in industrial production
        practices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ]
        Source reduction activities motivated by environmental
        protection goals have had a significant impact on the work
        environment. Many of the technological breakthroughs that
        have occurred in chemistry, process engineering, and
        industrial equipment in response to demand for reducing the
        environmental impact of production have had the added
        benefit of reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> exposure. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] But while most industrial hygienists would state their
        philosophical commitment to "prevention at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>,"
        source reduction strategies are not common in industrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hygiene</ENAMEX> practice. Indeed, early industrial hygienists
        maintained that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction was not a practical
        approach, nor even theoretically superior to local exhaust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX>, from a prevention standpoint. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] This
        latter view has been supported by an assumption that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> strategies that require changes to industrial
        processes or products are inherently "infeasible." Thus,
        "add-on" controls - ventilation systems and personal
        protective equipment - have dominated hazard prevention
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX> and practice. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        The question of the "feasibility of controls" has
        figured centrally in the regulation of toxic exposures in
        the workplace in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> One of the last tasks assigned by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Congress</ENAMEX> to the now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Technology</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX> was a review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Occupational Safety and</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Administration</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>) procedures for determining
        the feasibility of control strategies to limit worker
        exposures to occupational hazards. The report's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        found that
        
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s demonstrations of
        feasibility are often based on conservative assumptions
        about what compliance responses will predominate across
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX>...In a good number of the cases that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Technology Assessment</ENAMEX> examined, the actual
        compliance response that was observed included advanced or
        innovative control measures that had not been emphasized in
        the rulemaking analyses....<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> devotes relatively little
        attention to examining the potential of advanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> or the prospect of regulation-induced
        innovation to provide technologically and economically
        superior options for hazard control. Most attention does
        appear to be placed on conventional control measures (e.g.,
        increased ventilation and production enclosure), rather
        than on new technology ranging from sophisticated emissions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> devices to technologies capable of supporting basic
        shifts in production processes, including process
        redesigns, product reformulations, and material
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        Evidence for the report's conclusions included industry
        responses to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> dust standard, with which industry
        complied by modernizing equipment and processes at a
        substantially reduced cost (compared to those projected for
        traditional control approaches) and with tremendous
        production benefits, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> standard, where
        industry complied not by utilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>-recommended
        ventilation and enclosure strategy but with a source
        reduction strategy (low-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde resins</ENAMEX>) that had been
        available at the time of the rulemaking.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> promulgated a new comprehensive methylene
        chloride standard. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] This standard presented an
        opportunity for innovative control approaches. Methylene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX> has been characterized as a potential occupational
        carcinogen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Agency for Research</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational</ENAMEX> exposure to methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> can
        occur during its production and use as a paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stripper</ENAMEX>,
        cleaner, degreaser, adhesive thinner, process solvent and
        as an aerosol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>. With an odor threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 868</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/m 3</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> parts per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> or ppm), methylene chloride
        has poor warning properties and, due to its volatility,
        concentrations may rapidly approach high levels in poorly
        ventilated areas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Fatalities due to methylene
        chloride vapor inhalation in furniture stripping operations
        have been reported. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> methylene chloride standard is strict and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>; it lowered the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> time weighted average
        Permissible Exposure Limit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1736</TIMEX> mg/m
        3to 87 mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> ppm to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 ppm</NUMEX>) and required exposure
        monitoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> training, engineering controls,
        designation of restricted areas, spill and leak prevention
        and medical surveillance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> demonstrated that the
        proposed standard was technically and economically feasible
        with standard engineering controls and asserted that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> could comply with the new standard without
        eliminating methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> from industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
        A few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> are briefly
        described in the compliance guides that accompany the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, but these guides focus on local exhaust
        ventilation and work practices as the best ways to lower
        exposure. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] In response to complaints about the
        lowering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Permissible Exposure Limit</ENAMEX> for methylene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> replied: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> has determined that the
        final methylene chloride standard is feasible in all
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> without the need for substituting to
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>. It is not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s intention to force
        industries to abandon methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>..." [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        But abandon methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> is exactly what many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> did. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] They had begun that process several
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years before</TIMEX> in response to environmental regulations that
        restricted methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride emissions</ENAMEX> to the ambient air.
        Methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> is regulated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazardous Air</ENAMEX>
        Pollutant under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S. Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] Permits must
        be secured to discharge it to the atmosphere and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
        must use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maximum Available Control Technology</ENAMEX> for specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to prevent environmental contamination. The
        standard for vapor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">degreasers</ENAMEX> specifically recommends
        against local exhaust ventilation because of its potential
        role in generating emissions to the environment. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s primary recommendation for exposure control
        contradicted the goals of environmental protection by
        potentially increasing emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> to
        the environment.
        Additionally, for many processes, off-the-shelf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and chemistries were available to take
        methylene chloride's place. Probably in response to
        increasing regulation, chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and equipment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> have brought forth a generous array of
        methylene chloride source reduction strategies for its
        chief uses including substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemistries</ENAMEX>, mechanical and
        equipment innovations, and modernized processes. (See Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Indeed, it is one leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>'s opinion that
        effective substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemistries</ENAMEX> and technologies exist for
        virtually every current application of methylene chloride
        in industry (Personal communication, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K Wolf</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 15</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>).
        Despite the increased use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction
        techniques, there have been few reports of how source
        reduction process changes are undertaken in the "real
        world" and their impact on the work environment. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        Research reports on hazard prevention strategies usually
        involve a description of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and/or field tests of
        ventilation or personal protective equipment designs. While
        such reports may include a reporting of before and after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">air</ENAMEX> monitoring data, almost nowhere can you read about the
        process by which a prevention strategy was implemented (nor
        not) and its complex impact. Environmental case studies of
        source reduction, while more inclusive of contextual and
        practical factors, usually neglect to report on the impact
        of the source reduction strategy on the work
        environment.
        In the wake of increased environmental and occupational
        health regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>, we recognized an
        opportunity to systematically assess the issues related to
        source reduction that are important to the occupational
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> by using a timely case study approach. Our
        goal in undertaking these case studies was not to test
        hypotheses, but to capture the total detailed phenomena of
        source reduction for hazard prevention as manifested
        specifically in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases of methylene chloride
        source reduction for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health hazard prevention. We
        were interested in information about the experiences and
        perceptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the process as well as the
        technical details. Themes distilled from these case
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptions</ENAMEX> could be used to generate hypotheses for
        further study and/or to guide prevention interventions.
        While we began our investigation with such questions as:
        would "safer" substitutes introduce new hazards? Would
        changes motivated by environmental goals improve the work
        environment? What is the evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feasibility</ENAMEX> and effectiveness for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> protection? - the
        case study approach structures open-ended exploration
        through observation and interrogation of key informants.
        The ability to discover important issues not preconceived,
        to provide rich descriptions, to challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>' stock
        answers, and to get at "hows" and "whys" of their actions,
        are some of the several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> of the qualitative case
        study approach as detailed below.
      
      
        Methods
        This study used qualitative research methods to
        investigate and describe cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction for
        hazard prevention. The selection of these study subjects
        was the result of a sampling approach that sought
        information-rich cases available for in-depth study in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        diverse industrial settings. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, large
        and small, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different industrial sectors were
        enrolled as cases. The potential cases were initially
        selected from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that had reported their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Toxics</ENAMEX>
        Use <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reduction Act</ENAMEX> because they used <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 4545 kg</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10000 lbs</NUMEX>) of the chemical in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>. The list of
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was further narrowed to include only
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that had used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> in an
        industrial process, such as in cleaning or thinning, and
        not as a component in a product. Telephone calls to each of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> resulted in a pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> with
        interest in participating. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> agreed to
        participate (non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> cited a lack of time and
        inability to give access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> as reasons for
        refusal). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that had used methylene chloride
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior to 1997</TIMEX> and that were participating in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Demonstration Sites</ENAMEX> program sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use</ENAMEX>
        Reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowell</ENAMEX> were approached and also agreed to participate. In
        order to achieve representation by small furniture
        stripping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were invited to participate, but
        declined. Thus, criteria for inclusion were that a company
        had used or was using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> in an industrial
        process at the time of the study, and they agreed to
        participate in a scientific study and provide access and
        information as necessary to that study. Project resources
        limited the study to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases, but we achieved our
        sampling goal of including representation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        prospective case (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> still using methylene chloride
        at the time of the study) as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> diverse
        industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> (metal finishing, electrical equipment
        manufacture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber products</ENAMEX> manufacture and vessel
        cleaning services).
        The study protocol used to build the case studies
        involved site visits, telephone and in-person interviews
        and review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>-provided and public documentation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> triangulation, or the use of multiple data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to provide more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> perspective on the
        phenomenon under investigation, was used to enhance the
        depth of information about each case and internal validity.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] For example, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases we were able to access
        the documentation provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Toxic Use Reduction</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' participation in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Demonstration Site</ENAMEX> program and compare the
        reporting of process and motivational factors between the
        program documentation and that provided to us in
        interviews. The bulk of the qualitative data was collected
        in in-depth interviews with key informants where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> used a semi-structured, open-ended interview
        guide for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] These interviews were
        designed to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">informants</ENAMEX>' perspectives on the
        motivations, processes, and impacts related to their source
        reduction experience. Each interview was followed by a
        guided tour of the industrial process that had used
        methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. This tour or "site visit" allowed for
        additional informal questioning about the process. As an
        additional validation step for the most complex case - that
        of the metal finishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> - we confirmed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>' findings and interpretations via a review of
        the written case by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> conducted all the interviews and site visits and
        interviews notes were taken by hand. A description of the
        surface cleaning test methods and methylene chloride
        exposure assessment methods utilized in the metal finishing
        company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case</ENAMEX> are available upon request. Institutional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX> approval for research involving human subjects
        was sought and achieved for this study and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        signed informed consent forms.
        The components of the toxics use reduction
        implementation strategy - options identification, options
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, implementation and evaluation - guided the
        design of the prospective intervention study and the
        evaluation of the retrospective cases. Intra-case analysis
        proceeded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, data was categorized into
        each of the following analytic categories: description of
        the industrial processes involved; the source reduction
        approach and the steps each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> took to accomplish the
        change; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s motivations for the change; and the
        technical, environmental, health and safety and financial
        assessment of the change, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>

        case. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-case analysis included the summary of findings
        by analytic categories and the culling of salient

        implementation.
        Case studies are widely used in the environmental field
        to describe and promote pollution prevention approaches
        (see for example <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>p2gems.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>). Pollution
        prevention case studies are usually descriptive, focused on
        technical details, and written to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the
        value of the approach for that application. Case studies
        are also a particular mode of social science investigation
        that is especially appropriate to intervention research. In
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Research</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design</ENAMEX> and
        Methods , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yin</ENAMEX> notes that case studies "are the
        preferred strategy when 'how' or 'why' questions are being
        posed, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> has little control over
        events, and when the focus is on a contemporary phenomenon
        within some real-life context." [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Additionally</ENAMEX>, case
        studies are especially useful when context is key to
        understanding a particular phenomenon and we deem it useful
        to understand that phenomenon - in this case source
        reduction for hazard prevention - through its embodiment in
        particular cases. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] The case studies in this paper

            Process and Source Reduction
            All parts must be thoroughly cleaned before they can
            be plated. Lightly soiled parts are cleaned in-line (as
            part of the plating line) using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and alkaline
            water-based cleaning processes. Some types of
            materials, particularly small parts, convoluted parts
            or parts coated with heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protective oils</ENAMEX>, were
            cleaned in a methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride vapor</ENAMEX> degreaser before
            they entered the plating line. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> selected
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> because of its relatively high vapor
            pressure (requiring less heating to enter the vapor
            phase) and because it was less flammable than other
            degreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990</TIMEX>'s, in response
            to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> requirements, and in order to
            decrease the volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> used to below
            the state and federal reporting threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4545 kg</NUMEX>/yr
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10000 lb/y</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">degreaser</ENAMEX>'s refrigerated coils were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">refurbished</ENAMEX> and work practices were introduced to
            reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>. These work practices included using
            the cooling coils beyond the time when the degreaser
            was being used, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> monitoring of the coils,
            covering the degreaser when not in use, and lowering
            hoist speed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 meters</NUMEX> per minute (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8.5 ft/min</ENAMEX>) to
            reduce vapor drag-out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> is not fitted with
            local exhaust ventilation.
            Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> use declined by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> between
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 and 2002</TIMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> factors have
            accounted for this dramatic reduction: improved
            controls on the degreaser that prevented losses and
            therefore conserved new use; the loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regular
            plating orders that included parts that consistently
            "required" methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride degreasing</ENAMEX>; and source
            reduction process changes undertaken in conjunction
            with this study. In agreeing to work with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to further reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s use of
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>, the company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> reported that
            he was motivated by environmental regulations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean</ENAMEX>
            Air Act restrictions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Toxics Use</ENAMEX>
            Reduction Act reporting requirements), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health
            concerns, and the opportunity to improve the overall
            efficiency of the plating process by moving cleaning
            operations "in-line" with the other plating operations,
            thereby reducing labor costs and other production
            inefficiencies.
            During the "options identification" phase of this
            prospective source reduction study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
            and the company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> determined that aqueous
            cleaning might be an acceptable alternative to
            methylene chloride cleaning because aqueous cleaning
            was a proven technology that was frequently used in
            place of vapor degreasing in other metal finishing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had experience
            with aqueous cleaning in other applications and
            anticipated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon</ENAMEX>-based substitute
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degreasers</ENAMEX> would pose greater potential toxicity and
            environmental problems. Much of the work was already
            being cleaned aqueously in-line, and, as reported
            above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was eager to shift more of the work
            in-line. The barrier to doing so was inadequate aqueous
            cleaning effectiveness, thus "requiring" methylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride degreasing</ENAMEX> as a pre-cleaner.
            In order to find the best-performing cleaner for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s applications, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> requested
            that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> submit parts for a series of test
            cleanings at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use Reduction Institute</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surface Cleaning Laboratory</ENAMEX>. Following the laboratory
            studies, experimental cleaning runs were conducted at
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to determine the feasibility of cleaning
            more of the parts in-line (aqueously with the new
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemistry</ENAMEX>) thereby avoiding the methylene chloride
            degreasing pre-cleaning step. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> president
            determined that these trials were successful and
            quickly introduced the better performing substitute to
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the production lines. He then purchased a new
            pre-cleaning tank and began using the new cleaner on
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> remaining plating lines. These actions
            significantly reduced the use of the methylene chloride
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degreaser</ENAMEX>; most of the work pieces were no longer
            diverted to solvent pre-cleaning.
            Subsequent steps were consultation with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> for a less expensive
            "generic" version of the new cleaner and tests of this
            cleaner, and determination of bath maintenance
            schedules. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also consulted with their
            hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste hauler</ENAMEX> to determine any potential
            additional costs for treatment of wastewater associated
            with this process. These costs were determined to be
            acceptable. The company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> deemed the
            substitution of the better performing, less-expensive
            substitute chemistry successful. At the conclusion of
            the study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the work formerly degreased with
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was cleaned with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and an
            alkaline cleaner. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, at the beginning of this
            study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> operated the methylene chloride
            degreaser up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours a day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> a week for
            a total of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 hours</TIMEX> a week. At the conclusion of the
            study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>, it was used twice a week for a
            total of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> a week. No additional steps are
            planned to further reduce use of the methylene chloride
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degreaser</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Technical, environmental, health and safety and
            financial assessment
            Technical and performance criteria dominated the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s process for determining the acceptability of
            the substitute. Because the aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleaners</ENAMEX> had few
            reported health or safety hazards, especially in their
            diluted form, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material Safety Data Sheets</ENAMEX> were the only
            resources consulted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to gain information
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> potential environmental, health or safety
            concerns. Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> undertook a more thorough
            investigation, but did not discover any concerns that
            would lead us to recommend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> avoid
            certain products or processes associated with the new
            chemistry. Additionally, financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> did not
            figure prominently in the evaluation of the
            alternatives; the company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> did not express
            concern about costs within the scope of the proposed
            project, except to find a less expensive version of our
            recommended cleaner. However, financial concerns
            appeared to play a role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s decision to
            continue use of the degreaser on a limited basis rather
            than invest in alternative technology for the remaining
            work that could not be cleaned in-line with the
            substitute.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> are potentially over-exposed to methylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX> (compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA Permissible Exposure</ENAMEX>
            Limit of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">87 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3or 25</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX>) when operating or
            maintaining the degreaser. Prior to the shifting of the
            majority of the work to aqueous cleaning, we conducted
            one day of exposure monitoring following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>
            sampling method for methylene chloride
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osha</ENAMEX>-slc.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/dts/sltc/methods/organic/org080/org080.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
            The estimated time-weighted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-hour</TIMEX> exposure for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">247 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 3</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">71 ppm</NUMEX>). In shifting much of
            the pre-cleaning work to in-line aqueous cleaning, the
            company greatly reduced potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> exposure to
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> potentially may still be
            exposed to methylene chloride while operating the
            degreaser, but the reduced schedule of use means that
            they are less likely to be over-exposed compared to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Permissible Exposure Limit</ENAMEX>.
            What about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' potential exposure to the
            new aqueous cleaner? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> selected an alkaline
            liquid cleaner based on sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metasilicate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>).
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> include diethylene glycol n-butyl
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ether</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) and sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbonate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>). It is used at a
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> dilution. Because of its alkalinity, repeated
            exposure to this undiluted alkaline cleaner could have
            health effects including skin, eye and respiratory
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irritation</ENAMEX> and burning. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are unlikely
            to have any more than brief exposure to the chemical in
            its undiluted form. In its dilute form, the pH of the
            solution would be slightly less caustic than the
            concentrate, but still would be potentially hazardous
            as an irritant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> wear chemical resistant gloves
            and eye protection when handling the chemical and,
            while they may breathe in the water vapor above the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">heated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, they are unlikely to inhale the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>.
            However, no monitoring has been conducted to determine
            the pH of this vapor. The company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> said that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had not complained about irritation. The
            potential hazards associated with the use of the
            substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> include acute irritation and burns
            from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">accidental exposure</ENAMEX> due to spills or splashes. It
            is not expected that routine exposure under the
            conditions described would result in potential
            long-term irritation or other health effects.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recycle</ENAMEX>, and conserve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and electricity. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Health and Safety</ENAMEX> has
            championed these projects as well as an overall system

            Environment initiatives. These projects are popular at
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, in part, because they save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $2</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> (USD). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is recognized as an
            environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Process and Source Reduction
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1990 and 1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> phased methylene
            chloride out of their urethane mixing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> and tool
            cleaning operations and phased in two drop-in
            substitutes: dibasic esters and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol. In
            the urethane mixing vessel operation, following the
            automated mixing and discharge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane</ENAMEX> into a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bucket</ENAMEX>, the system is automatically purged with a
            solvent. This solvent was methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>; the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> introduced dibasic esters as a substitute.
            While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> is pouring the hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane</ENAMEX> from a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bucket</ENAMEX> onto a forming belt, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.5 liters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> oz) of
            dibasic esters are forced through the system and into a
            waiting bucket. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane</ENAMEX> is heated to 93°C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200°F</NUMEX>).
            Thus, the dibasic esters are emitted mostly as liquid,
            but also potentially as a component of a visible vapor
            resulting from contact of the liquid with the
            urethane-heated equipment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About three</NUMEX> batches are run
            per hour.
            In the change from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> to dibasic
            esters, the total volume of the solvent used was
            decreased through the rescheduling of batch jobs to
            reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> cleaning frequency and through the
            use of disposable and non-stick <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that were
            cleaned mechanically (wiping and scraping) rather than
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemically</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also used a vacuum distillation
            system to reuse the dibasic esters and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> now
            purchases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 3785</TIMEX> liters per year (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1000 gal/yr</ENAMEX>).
            This compares to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 21577 liters</NUMEX> per
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5700 gal/yr</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> purchased when it used the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>.
            In a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, mixing tools used to make
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane</ENAMEX> are soaked or agitated in buckets of dibasic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esters</ENAMEX> (instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>) and then soaked
            and rinsed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is investigating the substitution of liquid
            sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>) as a cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in place of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dibasic esters</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol process to
            further the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s goals of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxics</ENAMEX> use reduction and
            cost savings.
            Methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was targeted in the context of an
            aggressive pollution prevention program in this
            environmentally-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
            motivations include creating a positive image with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, limiting liability, improving compliance
            with regulations, lowering insurance and accident
            costs, improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s image with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
            thereby increasing loyalty, furthering good community
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> relations, reducing waste and, most
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, saving money. Methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was
            eliminated, in part, because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health concerns
            and, in part, because of its classification as a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazardous Air Pollutant</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>.
            Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Health and Safety</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> described the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> to
            the environment (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as 18 metric tons</NUMEX> per year or
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 US tons</NUMEX> per year) as "money up the stack."
          
          
            Technical, environmental, health and safety and
            financial assessment
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential drop-in
            substitutes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>. It selected dibasic
            esters over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> because of superior
            technical effectiveness. The change was evaluated in a
            company-designed process that looked at perceived
            environmental and worker health and safety impact and
            costs. Dibasic esters were determined to be acceptable
            from the environmental and health and safety
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> because they are also found in consumer
            products. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Health and Safety Director</ENAMEX>
            commented: "If this is good for a consumer product, it
            should be good for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> working with it as
            well." He suggested that there were few choices by the
            end of a technical and initial environmental assessment
            process. Dibasic esters were ultimately selected
            because they performed better than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl</ENAMEX> pyrrolidone
            and were deemed "safer."
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Methylene chloride exposure</ENAMEX> study results were not
            available, but according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, measured
            methylene chloride exposure levels were "an order of
            magnitude below the standard," which at the time would
            have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Permissible Exposure Limit of 1736</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/m
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 ppm</NUMEX>). However, had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> continued to use
            methylene chloride to clean tools and to perform the
            vessel cleaning tasks, they would potentially have been
            exposed above the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Permissible Exposure Limit</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/m 3</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 ppm</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel mixing</ENAMEX> and discharge rooms
            were relatively small, enclosed spaces and were
            noticeably elevated in temperature. These conditions,
            combined with the discharge of solvent at elevated
            temperature following its trip through the hot
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, would have created the potential for
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-exposure. This exposure would have been mitigated
            by the slot ventilation on the equipment at the point
            where the chemicals enter the bucket. However, other
            tasks with potential for high exposure were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uncontrolled</ENAMEX>, such as pouring solvent into the system
            and pouring the used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> into the recycling or
            waste containers. In the cleaning operations, the
            largely manual, uncontrolled processes, including
            pouring, stirring, mechanical cleaning, and emptying
            contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> into either waste
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> or the recycling distillation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, would
            have contributed to potential over-exposure.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> have eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' exposure to
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. The introduction of substitutes
            with extremely low volatility has also reduced the
            potential for inhalation of the substitute solvent in
            these tasks. The initiatives undertaken to minimize the
            use of dibasic esters, e.g. introducing non-stick
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buckets</ENAMEX>, also benefited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> by lessening their
            potential exposure, especially skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX>. Some
            manual handling tasks persist post-process change
            including cleaning tools and equipment and pouring used
            dibasic esters into the distillation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> were
            observed to be wearing cotton gloves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> were
            concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> would make their jobs more
            difficult, but were satisfied with the change
            ultimately. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> said that methylene chloride
            had caused skin and eye irritation (dibasic esters did
            not) and he was relieved to not have to worry as much
            about the consequences of accidental splashes.
            Following the substitution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Health</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> conducted air sampling for dibasic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esters</ENAMEX> in response to requests from state environmental
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. He was not successful in monitoring the
            substance with an organic solvent sampling method and
            concluded that due to the low volatility of dibasic
            esters, that there was no significant air
            contamination. Additionally, he did an evaporation
            study and found that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>, a beaker containing
            dibasic esters had no significant change in weight.
            Thus, losses in dibasic esters are largely unexplained,
            but may be due to spills, binding with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane</ENAMEX>,
            and/or vaporization of the product at high
            temperatures. Exposure to dibasic esters is not
            considered to be a hazard by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Because there
            is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit</ENAMEX>, the manufacturer
            of the product provided a guideline occupational
            exposure limit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> upon request and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> believes that occupational exposure to dibasic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esters</ENAMEX> is well within this guideline.
            Current knowledge of dibasic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">esters</ENAMEX>' occupational
            health effects would suggest that it is considerably
            less harmful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>.
            However, dibasic esters are potentially hazardous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and can cause skin, eye and respiratory tract
            irritation. They are absorbed through the skin and
            prolonged exposure can cause blurry vision (dibasic
            esters are metabolized to formic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>). According to
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material Safety Data Sheets</ENAMEX> for polyethylene
            glycol, there are little or no health effects
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with exposure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>. The American
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Hygiene Association</ENAMEX> has established a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Workplace Environmental Exposure Level</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 mg/m 3,</ENAMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] The very
            low vapor pressure of dibasic esters and polyethylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycol</ENAMEX> would mitigate against inhalation.
            The costs of hazardous waste disposal, raw material,
            and compliance related activities, were a major
            motivation for the elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>.
            Dibasic esters are more expensive than methylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, but a considerably lower volume of chemical
            is purchased due to the process changes described above
            and the lower volatility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>. The equipment
            expenditures that were required during the substitution
            were the remanufacture of equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">O-</ENAMEX>rings that were
            destroyed during technical evaluation of the substitute
            and some new mixing tools. The new mixing tools were
            estimated to have cost "a couple <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX>." The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> manufactured the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-rings themselves. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distillation</ENAMEX> equipment had been purchased for methylene
            chloride recycling. All potential methylene chloride
            compliance-related costs were avoided. While a complete
            financial assessment has not been performed by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> believed that considerable savings
            had been generated by the project.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> case is that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that makes
            electrical and electronic capacitors for original

            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>. Due to environmental contamination, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> entered into a consent agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
            to mothball its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and relocated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> to a new,
            purpose-built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285</NUMEX>
            manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shifts and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> eliminated the position of
            Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Safety</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX> and instead
            moved health and safety functions to the human
            resources <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and environmental functions became
            part of the facility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>'s responsibilities. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>/management health and safety committee
            has responsibility for health and safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.

            Processes and Source Reduction
            This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> in two
            processes. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> was a
            drop-in substitution for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> as an
            equipment cleaner. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> was identified
            as a potential substitute by their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>.
            Similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> described above in the rubber
            products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, a solvent is used to purge equipment
            after the equipment completes a batch coating of small
            capacitors with an epoxy coating. Isopropyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> used as a clean-up solvent, but n-methyl
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> is now also used (as methylene chloride
            was) as a general clean-up solvent for tools and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> is received in drums
            and decanted into solvent safety cans, squirt bottles
            and paper cups.
            Methylene chloride also had been used to dilute an
            adhesive used to seal the covers onto capacitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
            The adhesive also contained some methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>.
            This process has always been a partially automated one:
            most covers can be automatically sprayed with adhesive,
            but in some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had to manually apply the
            thin layer of adhesive using a small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> can
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applicator</ENAMEX>. In both cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> manually mixed
            methylene chloride with adhesive for application. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of adhesive for
            information about what substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> would work
            with their product. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> suggested a material
            based on dichlorofluoroethane, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon</ENAMEX>
            141b. It is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon and is one of the
            principal drop-in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> for the banned
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> began purchasing this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> as a drop-in substitute for methylene
            chloride.
            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-year</TIMEX> process to eliminate methylene
            chloride from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, the adhesive manufacturer
            also eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> from the adhesive by
            substituting aromatic hydrocarbons (xylene).
            Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> made equipment changes that
            increased the amount of this work that could be
            automated and reduced the requirement for diluting the
            adhesive for automated operations. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon</ENAMEX> is
            currently only used for manual operations, which are a
            small part of the process. Under pressure of the
            scheduled phase out of the chemical under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air</ENAMEX>
            Act, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was looking for ways to change their
            equipment to eliminate the need for a diluent in manual
            application of the sealant.
            Elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> was motivated by
            the toxics use reduction planning required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics</ENAMEX>
            Use <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reduction Act</ENAMEX> and interest in a positive
            environmental image. There was no apparent health and
            safety motivation for the reduction of use; planning
            and program activities for reduction and elimination of
            methylene chloride occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> prior to the new
            standard. Methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was eliminated from
            operations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
          
          
            Technical, environmental, health and safety and
            financial assessment
            Evaluation consisted primarily of assessing the
            technical performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX>. The company
            assumed that substitutes recommended by chemical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> would be acceptable from an environmental and
            health and safety perspective. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material Safety Data</ENAMEX>
            Sheets were reviewed by the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Health</ENAMEX>
            and Safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>, but not by the health and safety
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>. There was no other apparent evaluation to
            gauge impact on the production process, environment or
            health or safety conditions of the change. Costs and
            benefits were not assessed.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> are no longer exposed to methylene chloride
            at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. No methylene chloride exposure records
            were available and the facility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> did not think
            that any exposure monitoring had ever been done. Given
            methylene chloride's high volatility and the mostly
            uncontrolled nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> using methylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, the old process would probably have resulted
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-exposure. In the cleaning operation, other than
            decreased exposure due to reduced volatility of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX>, exposure potential remained the
            same as it had been when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were using methylene
            chloride for equipment purging and general clean up.
            Both tasks are uncontrolled manual processes and there
            is the potential for skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> from splashes and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> and inhalation exposure due to vaporization of
            bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> from open containers. Work practices
            included throwing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 liters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> oz) paper containers
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contaminated n-methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> into an open
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garbage</ENAMEX> container.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> pyrrolidone exposure can cause acute and
            chronic health effects in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX>
            has determined that it is not a potential substitute
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> because of both potential worker
            health and performance concerns. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ) It is an eye
            and skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">irritant</ENAMEX>, has a noxious odor and it has been
            found to cause fetal death and fetal abnormalities in
            rat studies. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX>'s vapor
            pressure at room temperature is very low, thus
            minimizing the chance of exposure by inhalation.
            However, skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adsorption</ENAMEX> is thought to be the main
            route of exposure. During the site visit, a worker
            doing the purging and cleaning operation was asked what
            he thought of the change. He noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl</ENAMEX>
            pyrrolidone was more irritating to the skin than
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>.
            In the sealant operation, the mixing of the sealant
            had occurred without local exhaust ventilation,
            although the manual and automatic application work area
            was equipped with local exhaust ventilation. The
            potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">methylene chloride exposure</ENAMEX> during mixing
            and decanting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> probably had been quite
            significant. The mixing area, which was adjacent to the
            process, was uncontrolled and very messy. Additionally,
            the work area/conveyer belt was also covered in the red
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sealant</ENAMEX> material. The process was not in operation
            during the site visit, so current work practices were
            not observed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>'s chemical resistant gloves
            were sitting partially turned inside out on top of the
            machine. After the process changes, manual operations
            were performed far less often than they had when
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was used.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon 141b</ENAMEX> is quite volatile and can cause the
            health effects of organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>, plus the health
            effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac arrhthmia</ENAMEX>.
            Because, in both cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> were essentially
            unchanged from the previous ones that used methylene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, there was no apparent impact on noise,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ergonomics</ENAMEX> or safety. It is possible that manual
            material handling was decreased due to the decreased
            volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> used; barrel loading and decanting
            tasks became less frequent with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.
            No financial accounting of the old process or the
            new one was undertaken as part of the change. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> and
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon 141b</ENAMEX>-based chemistry were both more expensive
            than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> is
            estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost four</NUMEX> times as expensive as
            methylene chloride on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per gallon</NUMEX> basis. However, due
            to the equipment and process changes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrrolidone</ENAMEX>'s lower volatility, much less of the new
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> are used compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>.
            According to the facility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, the proposed
            investment in equipment changes to facilitate the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sealant</ENAMEX> project required justification ("a song and
            dance") to the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. The company
            ordinarily requires an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> payback on capital
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX> (i.e., recover the cost of the investment
            through savings or increased revenues within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>)
            and this project was presented as an additional cost
            without monetized benefits. As a result, the project
            was approved on environmental grounds rather than
            financial ones. The production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> perceived
            non-quantified financial benefits of the change,
            including increased efficiency and flexibility and
            reduced environmental compliance requirements.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vessel Cleaning</ENAMEX>
          
            Background
            This vessel cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> over
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shifts and does <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> in business a year
            cleaning the inside and outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanker trucks</ENAMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1136</TIMEX> liter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 gal</NUMEX>) chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">totes</ENAMEX>. Many of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had worked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
            and, like other small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will
            sometimes also do the required work. The company
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> has experience in hazardous waste
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Common contaminants cleaned from the tanks
            and totes include floculating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for water
            treatment, latex, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coatings</ENAMEX>, paper industry chemicals and adhesives.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s Preamble to the methylene chloride standard
            noted that engineering controls, such as local exhaust
            ventilation were likely to be infeasible to control
            methylene chloride exposure below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permissible</ENAMEX>
            Exposure Limit in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> cleaning. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Preamble</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that respiratory protection equipment has been
            used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> cleaning and it expected
            that it would be relied upon under this standard.
          
          
            Process and Source Reduction
            In the usual cleaning process, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> first used
            hot and cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> under pressure to clean the outside
            and inside of the tank or tote. A caustic sodium
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metasilicate</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent solution</ENAMEX> was then sprayed
            followed by a steam cleaning designed to remove
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>. As necessary, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would also manually
            scrape out dried contaminant - a process that required
            a confined space entry permit.
            Of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was the process
            required to clean an adhesive used in the automotive
            industry from chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">totes</ENAMEX>. Prior to the process
            change described below, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> cleaned the inside
            of these totes with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> and manual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scraping</ENAMEX>. The cleaning process for this contaminant
            involved a worker pouring <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.6 liters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 gal</NUMEX>) of
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> into a tote, tipping and rolling it,
            releasing the lid to "degassify" it (as the manager
            explained it), getting into the tote and scraping for
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight hours a day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> also used
            methylene chloride to clean the outside of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">totes</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> management consulted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use</ENAMEX>
            Reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Surface Cleaning Laboratory</ENAMEX> and
            initially selected a very effective substitute cleaner
            based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-methyl pyrrolidone</ENAMEX> and dibasic esters. This
            change reduced the hazardous waste cost from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250</NUMEX> to
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70/tote</NUMEX>, but the cleaning process still took several
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also considered sand blasting, but
            determined that it would be too harsh on the totes.
            Following the receipt of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics</ENAMEX> Use Reduction
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute Demonstration Grant</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> moved to a
            "baking soda blast" process where a small amount of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking soda</ENAMEX> (to suppress dust) and
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> directs the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> through a nozzle. The task
            now takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> to do each tote. For the
            task of cleaning the outside of totes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> now
            use high-pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> instead of methylene
            chloride.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> began to look into alternatives out of
            concern over the volume of hazardous waste produced by
            this cleaning operation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>'s
            toxicity. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was looking for a
            faster, less labor-intensive work method. This became
            especially important after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> got a large
            contract for this work at a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> lost
            a significant portion of other work. The introduction
            of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> standard for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> also
            provided a significant incentive for this change. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> said he thought that the cost to comply with
            the new standard would be very expensive, especially
            the cost of the supplied air respirator (air-purifying
            respirators are not permitted for methylene chloride
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> prevention due to high breakthrough volume and
            limited warning properties). An additional factor that
            not only motivated, but also assisted with the change,
            was a demonstration project grant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use</ENAMEX>
            Reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> that defrayed the cost of the
            change and was accompanied by technical assistance. The
            free services of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Surface Cleaning Laboratory</ENAMEX> were
            utilized to find substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemistries</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Technical, environmental, health and safety and
            financial assessment
            As in the other cases, technical performance
            concerns dominated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s evaluation efforts.
            Unlike the other cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> chemical exposure to
            methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> was a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and this
            change eliminated a very serious potential methylene
            chloride exposure. In the old process, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were at
            risk of acute over-exposure from working in a confined
            space with this highly volatile and toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>. The
            new process greatly minimized the toxicity of the
            chemical exposure in this process, but introduced new
            physical hazards including noise and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ergonomic stress</ENAMEX>,
            such as awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postures</ENAMEX> and forceful exertions from
            carrying and directing the nozzle. Thumb pressure on
            the nozzle is a particular ergonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to rest and to "alternate
            fingers" to reduce the risk of injury.
            Noise from the new blasting equipment was not
            measured, but was perceived by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> to be
            potentially hazardous. Reportedly, the sales
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, with regard potential
            concerns about the noise levels of the equipment,
            "they'll get used to the noise." The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking soda</ENAMEX> is a
            mild respiratory irritant and for that reason, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> wear dust masks. Additionally, they use woven
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gloves</ENAMEX>, hearing protection, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyvek</ENAMEX> or cotton uniforms,
            safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glasses</ENAMEX> and boots. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> of this
            work is very hard but, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are much happier with the current process than
            they were when working with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> - a
            process that involved forceful manual scraping in
            awkward postures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at a time.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> estimated cost savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$910/tote</NUMEX> over
            the old process - a savings of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>. The manager
            specifically mentioned avoidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> compliance
            costs, especially the cost of the respirator, as a
            motivation behind the project. Other cost benefits
            included the ability to take on more of this work
            without expanding the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, and faster turnover
            of the work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s costs of the project were
            minimized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use Reduction Institute</ENAMEX>'s grant
            and the savings gained from finding a used compressor.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> describes the costs of the new process, with
            the exception of the purchase cost of the compressor,
            as minor.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Summary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction process changes
          Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> processes using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> in
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were adhesive thinning
          operations and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were cleaning operations. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> and one
          significantly reduced its use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX>. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> processes, commercially-available "drop-in"
          substitutes were used with little production process
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modification</ENAMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> process changes required some
          equipment or production process modification - in one
          case the entire process was replaced. Two process changes
          involved using mechanical cleaning in conjunction with
          new chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX>. Some of the source reduction
          process change initiatives took advantage of the normal
          cycles of change in industry facilitated by increasing
          and decreasing demand for products and services. A loss
          of orders enabled one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to use less methylene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, while an increase in orders prompted another to
          seek out an alternative to methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. Two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> continue to look for substitutes for their
          original substitutes - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, because of environmental
          concerns of the substitute and, the other, to lower
          costs.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that eliminated methylene chloride
          use did not first attempt to control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> and
          environmental exposure with engineering controls, but
          looked for substitutes directly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that
          continued to use methylene chloride implemented controls
          required by environmental regulations - and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>
          recommended controls, which, if implemented, might have
          conflicted with environmental protection. Despite taking
          steps, including significant expenditures, to control
          methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride emissions</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was still
          motivated to further reduce or eliminate use of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> relied on their chemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> for advice about safer substitutes. Two
          utilized technical assistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surface Cleaning</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory services of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics</ENAMEX> Use Reduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> were strongly motivated by environmental
          compliance and goals. Specifically, they sought to
          improve compliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>, reduce their
          reporting under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Toxics Use Reduction Act</ENAMEX>, and reduce
          hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX>. Worker health concerns, including
          compliance with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> standard, were a partial
          motivating factor in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases. Improving production
          efficiency was the major motivation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases. In a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> case, the costs of using a volatile chemical such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> also motivated the changes.
        
        
          Summary of technical, environmental, health and
          safety and financial assessment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>' evaluation efforts focused on technical
          performance concerns. However, potential substitute
          chemistries with obvious environmental problems were not
          evaluated to see if they would work. Financial,
          environmental and worker health evaluations of
          substitutes were minimal.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> completely eliminated exposure to
          methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> in routine and non-routine operations.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> significantly reduced over-exposure potential
          by reducing the duration of potential exposure. Based on
          available information, the substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemistries</ENAMEX> and
          processes appear to be less toxic and less hazardous in
          use than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Process
          changes and the physical properties of the new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemistries</ENAMEX> reduced potential exposure through reduction
          in quantity of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> used, lower volatility, and
          increased automation. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases, the principal
          potential hazard of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> is acute eye, skin
          and/or respiratory irritation.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> selected potentially hazardous substitute
          chemistries: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a potential reproductive hazard with
          potential for exposure through skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adsorption</ENAMEX>, the other
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>-depleter and a potential cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>.
          However, in the later case, the total quantities used and
          potential for exposure in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were minimal. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, potential ergonomic hazards of the old
          process using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> were eliminated with
          methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>, but the new process introduced new
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ergonomic</ENAMEX> hazards. A noise hazard was also
          introduced.
          Within general constraints of not wishing to invest
          large amounts of money in capital equipment, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were not especially concerned about potential
          negative financial impacts of the changes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> conducted a financial analysis of the change.
          However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> did try to economize on the costs
          of the changes. While the new chemistries cost more than
          methylene chloride on a volume basis, the lower
          volatility and improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> from the source
          reduction process changes resulted in lower chemical
          consumption and costs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> anticipated and
          reaped significant financial benefits from the
          changes-mainly through improved production
          efficiency.
        
        
          Study limitations and strengths
          This study used a case study approach to detail issues
          related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction process change. As such, its
          conclusions may not be generalizable due to the small
          sample size and selection bias due to a sampling strategy
          that selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> for participation based upon
          their willingness to participate. Additionally, the
          findings are largely the result of a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s interpretation of the data and cases.
          Evaluation is meant to figure as a fundamental component
          of the source reduction process. However, the small scope
          of the project, and restrictions in the amount of time
          and resources of the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, meant that
          neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> benefited
          from ideal systematic financial, technical and
          environmental, health and safety assessments. Finally,
          this research focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chemical and just a few
          industrial processes and may or may not apply to other
          cases, especially those with more specialized processes,
          or where the hazard in question is a formulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s product and change would
          require re-engineering of the product itself, rather than
          of an auxiliary process.
          The study strengths include a rich, descriptive case
          study approach useful in understanding, in detail, source
          reduction as a hazard control technique, including
          practical limitations, potential for missed opportunities
          to improve the work environment, unintended consequences,
          future directions for preventive approaches, and research
          needs. The discovery of themes common across these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          cases suggests their potential generalizability as
          categories of analysis. The findings of this study can
          guide further investigation of the feasibility and
          effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction in other applications.
          Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> believe that the
          experience of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> largely comports with the
          experience of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> who had
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylene chloride</ENAMEX> based upon an investigation of
          more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        These cases suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction strategies can
        be a feasible and effective approach to compliance with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workplace</ENAMEX> and environmental standards and reduction of
        worker health hazards. In its methylene chloride standard,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> had concluded that engineering controls were not
        feasible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> cleaning and this industry would rely
        on supplied-air respirators for exposure control. We found
        that for a vessel cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other diverse
        industrial examples, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction process changes that
        eliminated methylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> use were not only feasible,
        but beneficial to production and environmental protection
        goals.
        The experience of these cases also suggests that
        technical assistance sensitive to both technical and
        occupational and environmental health concerns could help
        maximize the benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction process change
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>. Typically, technical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> are top-priority
        and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies trust</ENAMEX> that "unlisted" products and
        products recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> are
        "safe." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> may make sub-optimal choices, from an
        occupational health and safety or environmental standpoint,
        with inadequate information about alternatives.
        And finally, it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction strategies
        can result in financial benefits, without even considering
        the reduced costs of regulatory compliance. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
        look at processes, they often try to improve them overall,
        by reducing the problems they cause (environmental
        contamination and worker exposure) and innovating
        production improvements. Financial concerns associated with
        the change, other than significant capital investments, do
        not appear to be a major barrier to the utilization of
        source reduction strategies, especially when the changes
        are motivated by regulatory compliance.
        A recommendation based upon these project findings is
        that source reduction should be included in the category of
        potential feasible and effective strategies for compliance
        with standards and reduction of health hazards. Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> may miss opportunities to improve processes, both
        from an environmental, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health, and production
        standpoint without adequate technical assistance that comes
        from non-commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should
        devote resources to this task and/or link <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Technical assistance programs and small grants
        and loans can play a positive role in facilitating the
        innovation that can be realized from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction. This
        may be especially true for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to do extensive research or modeling of
        alternatives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Use Reduction Institute Surface</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleaning Laboratory</ENAMEX> has played a critical role in assisting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in finding alternatives and
        demonstrates a positive model for other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
        Intervention research is needed to find ways of
        coordinating technical assistance with regulation and
        compliance activities to maximize efficient and effective
        dissemination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reduction strategies. For example,
        in this study it was found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> distribution
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> may be a primary and often exclusive source of
        information on alternatives. Efforts could be targeted to
        improve the quality of information and services provided to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> through their chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>.
