        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyclosporine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX>) and tacrolimus (TAC) are the primary
        immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> used for the prevention of acute
        rejection after renal transplantation. The long-term
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CsA</ENAMEX> or TAC results in
        side effects such as nephrotoxicity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and
        gingival hyperplasia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirolimus</ENAMEX> (SRL) a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is structurally similar to TAC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to same binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein FKBP</ENAMEX>, but its mechanism of
        action is different [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Both clinical and experimental
        studies demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> when used either with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX> or
        alone is associated with side effects such as
        hyperlipidemia, thrombocytopenia and nephrotoxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> have affinity for the same binding
        site, it was thought to be ineffective when used together.
        However, experimental and clinical studies have refuted
        this assumption, and have successfully demonstrated the
        efficacy of this combination therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Encouraged by our recent 
        in vitro study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] that
        demonstrated a significant inhibition of lymphocyte
        proliferation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> and induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² expression by
        combination of sub-clinical concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> with
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CsA</ENAMEX>, we conducted the current study on renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> stable renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were selected to participate in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetic</ENAMEX> (PK) and immune function study with
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> therapy in human transplant. The
        current study describes the analysis of immune function in
        stable renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and TAC
        combination therapy.

          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>/Patients
          Stable renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAC</ENAMEX> based
          immunosuppression were included in this study. Definition
          of "stable" transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is based on post
          transplant care, renal function, acute rejection
          episodes. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were enrolled after
          informed consent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azathioprine/MMF</ENAMEX> (Mycophenolate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motefil</ENAMEX>) were discontinued prior to initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were on corticosteroids. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h)
          after discontinuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aza/MMF</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were
          collected at time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (baseline) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> after the
          administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> for lymphocyte proliferation and
          cytokine expression at the gene and protein level. SRL
          was started on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 0</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were maintained on the
          same dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were
          repeated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 14</TIMEX> for immune functions, again at time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> (baseline and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> after). The graphic
          representation of the treatment protocol is shown in
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The effect of this concomitant therapy on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> function was studied by quantifying lymphocyte
          proliferation and the mRNA expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î², <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> levels of

          by a cytokine bead array system and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA</ENAMEX>.
          Trough levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> were not available as they
          were processed in central core laboratory as a part of

            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). Similarly, a significant decrease (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>)
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclin E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was noted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX> Â±

            of decreased expression of cyclin and increased p21
            mRNA expression correlates with the decreased

          Circulating levels of cytokines
          Combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> resulted in a significant

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î² protein</ENAMEX> expression in sera of patients
          Since we observed a significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² mRNA
          expression in lymphocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with
          combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC/MMF/Aza</ENAMEX>, we
          also studied circulating levels of total TGF-Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid activated sera</ENAMEX> from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The results
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) demonstrate statistically increased levels (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² in renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> after
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">107 Â± 17.7 ng/ml vs 135 Â± 18</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>). These results demonstrate that decreased
          lymphocyte proliferation in part may be due to increased
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A number of studies have demonstrated that long
        treatment of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> is associated many side
        effects such as nephrotoxicity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and gingival
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperplasia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Rapamycin clinically termed, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirolimus</ENAMEX> (SRL) is a new immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, which is
        structurally similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX>, binds to same binding protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FKBP</ENAMEX>, but has different mechanism of action [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Both
        clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that SRL
        when used either with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX> or alone is associated with side
        effects like hyperlipidemia, thrombocytopenia and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAC</ENAMEX> compete for the
        same binding site and hence it was thought they could not
        be used concomitantly. However, recent experimental and
        clinical studies have refuted this assumption, and have
        successfully used this combination therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore there is need of an alternate strategy to use
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. Recently
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , we have demonstrated the efficacy of combination
        of low doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CsA</ENAMEX> or TAC to inhibit
        lymphocyte proliferation. The results from this study also
        demonstrate the increased immuno modulation in renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> by this therapy. The synergistic
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated in animal
        models and clinical transplantation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . This
        prompted us to explore the mechanistic action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> when used in combination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> when received a
        concomitant therapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> exhibited a significant
        inhibition of their lymphocytes when cultured with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitogens; PHA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ConA</ENAMEX> and anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>, compared to the
        proliferation of lymphocytes obtained from when they were
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMF/Aza</ENAMEX>. Such a sustained effect is
        expected to prevent graft rejection, demonstrating the
        efficacy of this combination in renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>.
        To analyse the mechanism of the effect of concomitant
        therapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> on lymphocyte proliferation, we
        studied the mRNA expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î², <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p21</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Il-6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, cyclins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.</ENAMEX> The results demonstrated a
        significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² mRNA expression (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.03</NUMEX>)
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX>. The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p21</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was also
        increased in renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> with this therapy.
        These results are consistent with our previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² mediates in part the immunosuppressive
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CsA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX>. Current study supports our
        hypothesis that the immunosuppression results in an
        increased expression of cyclin inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p21</TIMEX>, which by
        inhibiting the expression of cyclins controls the
        allo-immune activation. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p21</TIMEX> is one of the most potent
        cyclin inhibitor, these results may explain the significant
        inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes may in part be
        due to the increased p21 expression. The expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin E</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, which controls the cell cycle progression
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G0/S</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase of cell cycle, was decreased with TAC
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> therapy. The expression of cyclins also corresponds
        to the decreased lymphocyte proliferation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and TAC
        therapy.
        We noted an increased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> mRNA
        in lymphocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with concomitant therapy with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX>. A number of experimental and clinical studies
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] have demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> and correlates with increased graft survival.
        The results from this study demonstrate down regulation of
        cyclins, and up-regulation of cyclin inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p21</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> mRNA expression.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> has also been considered to possess
        both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In
        this study, we observed an increase in mRNA expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>. Acute rejection has been associated with increased
        intragraft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6 protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        However, other studies have failed to demonstrate any
        correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> production and rejection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        The current study demonstrate that a concomitant therapy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> increases expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and its significant remains to be
        evaluated.
        We also quantified circulating levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î², <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>,
        IL-4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³.</ENAMEX> The results from this study
        demonstrate that addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> therapy results in
        a significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) increase in circulating levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-Î².</ENAMEX> We have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² in part
        mediates the immunosuppressive effects of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 21 22</NUMEX> ] and therefore the increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² may
        partially explain the increased inhibition of mitogen
        induced lymphocyte proliferation. Though the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²
        has been correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug induced nephrotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        it is early to speculate if this combination will also
        result in an increased nephrotoxic effects. We are unable
        to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity with this combination due
        to short course of therapy.
        The levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4 and IL-2</TIMEX> were decreased
        substantially with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> therapy {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.03</NUMEX>)}. This
        indicates that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> also resulted in decreased inflammatory
        response.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, these results provide evidence to
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> combination therapy in
        renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> to the
        immunosuppressive regimen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tac</ENAMEX> resulted in decreased
        lymphocyte proliferation exhibiting decreased allo-immune
        response. Also, mRNA expression of proinflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interferon-Î³</ENAMEX> and cyclins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX>, and E were
        significantly decreased and the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² and p21
        were increased. The addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> significantly decreased
        the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
        conversely increased the circulating levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²,
        partially explaining the increased immunosuppression in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, due to short span of this
        treatment, the nephrotoxic effects remains unclear. These
        novel findings provide a mechanism and rationale for a
        concomitant therapy with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRL</ENAMEX> in renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
