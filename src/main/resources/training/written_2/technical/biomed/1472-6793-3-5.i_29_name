        Reduction in hypothalamic melanocortin tone, caused by
        reduction in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and elevation
        in agouti-related peptide (AGRP) mRNA, is thought to play a
        key role in mediating nutritional effects on neuroendocrine
        function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Thus fasting [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        deficiency [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and leptin deficiency [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] are all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with reduced hypothalamic melanocortin tone.
        However, factors that regulate hypothalamic melanocortin
        tone are not fully elucidated. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both fasting</TIMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX> are associated with reduced plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and leptin replacement reverses effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasting</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and also effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency on
        food intake and body weight [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , it has been suggested
        that the reduction in leptin accounts for the reduced
        hypothalamic melanocortin tone in these conditions.
        However, fasting can influence hypothalamic gene expression
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> independent of changes in plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , as well as in leptin resistant 
        db/db <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These data suggest
        that other factors in addition to leptin may mediate
        effects of fasting. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fasting</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX>, and
        leptin insufficiency also lead to an elevation in plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and adrenalectomy of
        leptin-deficient 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> largely normalizes
        hypothalamic gene expression in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , it is
        plausible that elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> may mediate some
        effects of nutritional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> on hypothalamic gene
        expression. This hypothesis is particularly compelling
        since recent data suggest that aberrant glucocorticoid
        activity may play a key role in the development of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metabolic</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Glucocorticoids have previously been reported to
        increase body weight set point, as determined by hoarding
        behavior in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , while adrenalectomy has been
        reported to lower body weight set point in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, central infusion of glucocorticoids leads to
        increases in body weight and food intake with a concomitant
        induction of hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless, it
        remains unclear if an elevation in glucocorticoid
        concentration contributes to the effect of fasting on
        hypothalamic gene expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> has been
        reported to block elevations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasting</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, it has been reported
        that elevation of plasma corticosterone levels is not
        required for the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA by fasting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        In addition, the extent to which hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and POMC
        mRNA depends on elevated glucocorticoid levels in fasting
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX> has not been determined to date.
        Therefore in the present study we assessed if an elevation
        of plasma corticosterone is necessary and sufficient to
        mediate effects of fasting and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency on
        hypothalamic melanocortin tone, as indicated by expression
        of hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Effects</ENAMEX> of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic
          responses to fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasting</ENAMEX> reduced body weight and adipose weight in both
          the sham-operated and adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as expected
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood glucose</ENAMEX> was also decreased by fasting in
          both the sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and adrenalectomized group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Serum corticosterone concentration increased
          with fasting as expected in the sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A); adrenalectomy blocked this fasting-induced elevation
          of corticosterone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Therefore the
          adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fasted mice</ENAMEX> exhibited similar levels of
          corticosterone as both the adrenalectomized ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lib</ENAMEX> fed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the sham-operated ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lib</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). As
          we noted previously, a basal level of corticosterone was
          detectable in the adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> after surgery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          ] . In contrast to corticosterone, other humoral factors
          were not significantly affected by adrenalectomy. Serum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and serum leptin both exhibited the same
          decreases in the adrenalectomized fasted and
          sham-operated fasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> compared to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomized</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lib</ENAMEX> fed and sham-operated ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lib</ENAMEX> fed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1C</ENAMEX>); therefore the levels of these
          humoral factors were the same in the sham-operated fasted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the adrenalectomized fasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          Fasting increased hypothalamic AGRP mRNA as expected
          in the sham-operated fasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and adrenalectomy
          completely blocked the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> by fasting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> also produced a trend to decrease AGRP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> in the ad-lib fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> but this effect was not
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Fasting</ENAMEX> decreased hypothalamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA as expected in the sham-operated fasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fasting</ENAMEX> had no effect on POMC mRNA in the
          adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX>, NPY
          mRNA was also elevated after fasting, and this effect of
          fasting on NPY mRNA was also completely blocked by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> therefore
          completely blocked the effects of fasting on hypothalamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNAs.
        
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Effects</ENAMEX> of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic
          responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX> and fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Streptozotocin</ENAMEX> injection induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in
          sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Interestingly,
          adrenalectomy attenuated the rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> in
          streptozotocin-injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasting</ENAMEX> reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ADX-STZ-Fast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> below even that
          of control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Streptozotocin</ENAMEX> injection led
          to reduced body weight and adiposity in sham-operated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 17</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>),
          whereas adrenalectomy attenuated the loss of both body
          weight and adiposity associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Streptozotocin</ENAMEX> injection also led to
          significant hyperphagia, typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), and adrenalectomy also ameliorated this
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Serum corticosterone was elevated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sham</ENAMEX>-STZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and was decreased in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADX-STZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADX-STZ-Fast</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> did not result in
          complete elimination of corticosterone but instead
          resulted in low but detectable levels of serum
          corticosterone as previously noted [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and described
          above. Serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> was reduced to the same extent in
          Sham-STZ, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADX-STZ</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ADX-STZ-Fast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, compared
          to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as would be expected with streptozotocin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Serum leptin was also reduced to the
          same levels in all experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothalamic AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA was significantly elevated in
          sham-operated diabetic (vs. sham-operated euglycemic)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as expected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 17</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). However,
          adrenalectomy completely blocked the elevation of AGRP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX> whether or not they were fasted
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA was reduced in diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as expected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 17</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). Adrenalectomy
          blocked this reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX>
          whether or not they were fasted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). As with AGRP
          mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA was elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> blocked this induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX> whether or not they were fasted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C).
          In summary, hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA all
          exhibited the expected changes in association with
          streptozotocin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 17</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,4C</ENAMEX>),
          and adrenalectomy largely or completely blocked all these
          responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were fasted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A,4B,4C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Effects</ENAMEX> of corticosterone implants on
          hypothalamic gene expression
          Implantation of corticosterone implants for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>
          significantly increased serum corticosterone, compared to
          placebo-implanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A).
          Interestingly, the corticosterone implants also
          significantly increased serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and leptin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5C</ENAMEX>). In contrast, the corticosterone implants did
          not significantly influence body weight or food intake
          compared to placebo-implanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (body weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.5</NUMEX> ±
          0.6 g for the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24.4 ± 0.6 g</NUMEX> for
          the corticosterone implant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; food intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> ±
          0.1 g/day for the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          g/day for the corticosterone implant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), although
          epididymal adipose tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX> was slightly smaller in
          the corticosterone implant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.19 ± 0.01</NUMEX> g for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placebo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.15 ± 0.01 g</NUMEX> for the
          corticosterone implant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
          Corticosterone implants also had no influence on blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">134.8 ± 10.9</NUMEX> mg/dl for the placebo group
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128.8</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl for the corticosterone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>).
          Implantation of corticosterone implants for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>
          significantly elevated hypothalamic AGRP expression
          compared to the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). Hypothalamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA was also significantly elevated in the
          corticosterone implant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothalamic</ENAMEX> NPY
          mRNA exhibited a trend toward an increase although the
          effect was not significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). Therefore
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic AGRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNAs were both induced by the
          glucocorticoid implant, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA was not
          significantly influenced.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In the present study, adrenalectomy and corticosterone
        implants were used to address the role of elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosterone</ENAMEX> in mediating the effects of fasting and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX> on hypothalamic gene expression,
        resulting in several novel observations. First, we have
        demonstrated that adrenalectomy can block the elevation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA and the reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA with fasting,
        consistent with previous findings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponsalle et</ENAMEX> al.
        concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and suggesting that increases in
        corticosterone mediate fasting-induced changes in
        melanocortin tone. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we have also shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic</ENAMEX> responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency require
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> in corticosterone. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we have demonstrated
        using corticosterone implants, that elevated corticosterone
        is sufficient to enhance hypothalamic AGRP expression, but
        not to reduce hypothalamic POMC mRNA. Together these
        results suggest that an elevation of corticosterone is
        necessary for reduction in melanocortin tone during fasting
        and with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and is sufficient to induce hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA but not to reduce POMC expression.
        Although a reduction in plasma leptin plays an important
        role in mediating neuroendocrine responses to fasting [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , we have previously demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasting</ENAMEX> can regulate hypothalamic melanocortin tone
        independently of both leptin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The
        present studies suggest that corticosterone may play a role
        in mediating these leptin-independent effects. Fasting was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corticosterone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) and
        reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and leptin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1C</ENAMEX>) as well as
        melanocortin tone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>) as expected. However,
        preventing the elevation of corticosterone completely
        blocked the effect of fasting on hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and POMC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>), without preventing effects of fasting
        on plasma leptin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> also blocked the
        effects of fasting on hypothalamic NPY mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C),
        confirming the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponsalle et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leptin</ENAMEX>'s effect to reverse effects of
        fasting on melanocortin tone may require and be mediated by
        a reduction in glucocorticoids.
        Glucocorticoids were also elevated, as expected, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A), and serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX> and melanocortin tone were also reduced in this
        condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Band <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4B</ENAMEX>). As with fasting, the
        reduction in plasma leptin could largely be a reflection of
        the reduction in adipose weight, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma insulin</ENAMEX>.
        In turn, as with fasting, the reduction of plasma leptin
        could be the cause of the elevation of hypothalamic AGRP
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX> mRNA, as well as the reduction of hypothalamic POMC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, blocking the rise in
        corticosterone by adrenalectomy prevented the reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA and the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA,
        without reversing either the reduced leptin or the reduced
        adiposity, characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4B</ENAMEX>). These data suggest that reversal of
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> deficiency by leptin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] may require
        and be mediated by a reduction in glucocorticoids. We had
        previously shown that fasting could regulate hypothalamic
        gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> even though in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fasting did not influence plasma leptin or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adrenalectomy</TIMEX> blocked the
        fasting-induced reduction in melanocortin tone in diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (as it had in euglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study),
        these results suggest that effects of fasting on
        melanocortin tone in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic mice</ENAMEX> may be mediated at least
        in part by a rise in plasma corticosterone (itself possibly
        secondary to the reduction in plasma leptin).
        Implanting corticosterone implants for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> led to
        an elevation in both hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        6B). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adrenalectomy</TIMEX> blocked the elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA
        by fasting and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin deficiency</ENAMEX>, elevation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosterone</ENAMEX> would be expected to increase hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA, as was indeed observed. However, the
        corticosterone implants produced the unexpected effect of
        elevating hypothalamic POMC mRNA, a rare if not unique
        circumstance in which hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA are
        regulated in the same direction. The basis of this
        unexpected phenomenon is not yet clear. However, since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> both stimulate hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        , the elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and leptin in the
        corticosterone-implanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5C</ENAMEX>), the former
        possibly mediated by glucocorticoid-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance and the latter possibly mediated by the
        resulting hyperinsulinemia, might mediate the observed
        effect of corticosterone implants on hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">implanted mice</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, leptin inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AGRP mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , yet AGRP mRNA was
        nevertheless elevated in the face of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that in fasting and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, as in leptin-deficient 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 19</ENAMEX> ] , glucocorticoids
        dominate leptin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels in determining AGRP
        expression, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and leptin dominate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> in determining hypothalamic POMC
        expression. These data are also consistent with the
        observation that in streptozotocin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diabetic rats</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is not sufficient to normalize
        elevated serum corticosterone or the elevated hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA while it does partially normalize plasma leptin
        and hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        After the present paper was submitted for review, we
        became aware of a recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savontaus et</ENAMEX> al.
        examining the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of
        hypothalamic gene expression in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , using a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> similar experimental design as in the present
        study. In several respects the conclusions from this study
        are similar to the present study (for example,
        corticoisterone implants increased hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA, and adrenalectomy blocked the effect of fasting
        on hypothalamic POMC mRNA). However, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key respect the
        results reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savontaus et al.</ENAMEX> differed from those in
        the present paper: adrenalectomy failed to block the
        effects of fasting on hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPY</ENAMEX>, even
        though corticosterone implants were observed to induce AGRP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX>. Since we observed that adrenalectomy also blocks the
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> on hypothalamic gene expression in the
        present study, we suspect the difference between the
        present study and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savontaus et al.</ENAMEX> is probably due
        to different regulatory requirements in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. For
        example, it is clear that the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AGRP</ENAMEX> differs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, since in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice hypothalamic</ENAMEX> AGRP mRNA is
        elevated by a deficiency in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leptin</ENAMEX> receptor function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        but in rats this is not true [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> is regulated similarly in rats and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and this is
        probably the more important element regulating metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
        Taken together, these data suggest that elevated
        glucocorticoids are sufficient to drive the increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA during fasting and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> but not
        the reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA. Interestingly, at least with
        respect to food intake and body weight over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this 48-hour</TIMEX>
        period, the elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> appears to compensate for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> to produce no net functional effect on
        body weight homeostasis in the presence of significantly
        elevated plasma corticosterone. After more chronic
        exposure, this delicate balance could plausibly become
        disrupted, leading to glucocorticoid-mediated development
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Thus interactions
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, leptin, and glucocorticoids, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuropeptide</ENAMEX> responses they generate within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanocortin</ENAMEX> system, allow complex metabolic responses to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> status but may also allow the development of
        metabolic pathologies.

          The appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Review Board</ENAMEX> had
          approved all studies.
          To study the effect of adrenalectomy on
          fasting-induced changes in hypothalamic gene expression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study 1</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two month-old</TIMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57Bl/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were obtained

          underwent a sham operation. Adrenalectomy was performed,
          as described previously, by bilateral flank incision
          under anesthesia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-2-2-tribromoethanol</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX>

          entailed the same procedure as adrenalectomy, except that
          the adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">glands</ENAMEX> were grasped but not removed. After
          the surgery all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> injection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">45 mg/kg b.w. i.p.</ENAMEX>) to facilitate recovery
          from surgery. The drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was replaced with normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>) to compensate for the loss of

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> at which time it was
          verified that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had recovered initial body
          weight as expected. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were placed in fresh cages
          with new bedding, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was removed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the

          Laboratory (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME) and were individually housed
          with free access to feed and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> under <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12 h</TIMEX>
          light-dark cycle as described above. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were treated
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> injections of dexamethasone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body

          either adrenalectomized or sham operated as described
          above. Half the sham-operated and all the
          adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were injected with streptozotocin
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> after the surgery (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">160 mg/kg</ENAMEX> body weight; freshly

          To study the direct effects of corticosterone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), a corticosterone implant study was conducted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>

          For all studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were sacrificed following a
          balanced design towards the end of the light period
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 17:00 and 18:30 h</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were decapitated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decapitation</ENAMEX> after a brief (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 45 second</TIMEX>)

          not significantly affect the plasma corticosterone levels
          under these conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Adrenalectomy was
          verified in each individual by visual inspection to
          assure that no visible traces of the adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">glands</ENAMEX> were
          observed. Brains for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis were quickly
          removed and the hypothalamus was dissected out, frozen on
          dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-70°C until</TIMEX> use. Epididymal white

          Statistical analysis
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study, statistical analysis entailed a
          two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed, when
          indicated by appropriate p-values (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), by
          Tukey-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramer</ENAMEX> post-hoc test, using the JMP statistical
          package implemented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> operating system.
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study a one-way analysis of variance was
          performed and followed, when indicated by appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-values (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tukey-Kramer</ENAMEX> post-hoc test
          using the JMP statistical package. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> study
          unpaired t-tests were carried out using the JMP
          statistical package. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX> was
          considered significant.
