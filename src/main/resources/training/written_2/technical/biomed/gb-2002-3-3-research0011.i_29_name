        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> goals of most microarray experiments are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">description</ENAMEX>, classification, or characterization. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> have been used to describe
        comprehensively the diauxic shift, progression through the
        cell cycle, sporulation and the effects of treatment with a
        small molecule [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. They have been used to
        classify the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> type of a given sample or classify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of co-regulated genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Finally,
        microarrays have been used to characterize biological
        systems using comparisons of wild-type and mutant cells,
        with the goal of obtaining mechanistic insights [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>].
        Searching for concerted, dramatic changes in gene
        expression or searching for differential expression of a
        given gene has been a successful method in analyzing
        transcription-profiling data, especially in description or
        characterization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 12</ENAMEX>]. Often, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> take a
        manual approach to accomplishing these tasks. However,
        manual approaches to data analysis are sometimes
        impractical or cumbersome, inspiring the development of
        tools to accomplish the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> goals described above. A
        variety of techniques such as hierarchical clustering, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -means clustering and
        self-organizing maps have been implemented with success,
        especially in classification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        As the number of publicly available profiles in 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone now
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exceeds 500</ENAMEX>, a great need exists to exploit this
        information properly to understand cell function. At least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent international projects have been set up
        to serve as database-driven repositories of genome-wide
        expression data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. A major effort is being made to
        systematize data storage, especially involving XML
        (extensible markup language), to ensure interoperability of
        these databases and associated analysis tools.
        A related need that has been less addressed is the
        systematization of expression data analysis. This
        requirement extends not only to analysis but also to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pedagogy</ENAMEX> and to practical aspects of algorithm
        implementation. Various studies in the literature have
        successfully implemented tools from vector algebra in
        analyzing genome-wide expression data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 15, 16</TIMEX>].
        However, a framework for the analysis of transcription
        profiles using vector algebra has not yet been codified.
        Here we present such a framework. Common statistical
        measures have natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in vector algebra that
        have visual interpretations and are easily implemented on a
        computer. Within this framework, the analysis of
        genome-wide expression data is converted to the study of
        high-dimensional vector spaces. The many powerful theorems
        that have been developed in vector algebra can be applied
        to these spaces, and these theorems offer biologically
        relevant insights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX> of the vector space can also be
        analyzed statistically. This construction has analytic and
        pedagogic appeal.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Constructing expression vectors
          Transcription-profiling experiments offer different
          kinds of measurements depending on the technology used.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type of technology (using noncompetitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>) measures absolute gene expression, while a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type (using competitive hybridization) measures
          relative gene expression. A microarray that uses
          competitive hybridization yields a list of fold changes
          for each gene between the conditions or cell types
          measured. The data from a microarray that uses
          noncompetitive hybridization can be 'divided' (after
          proper normalization) into another microarray of the same
          type to produce the fold change of each gene from one
          condition to another. In practice, even those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who use noncompetitive technology platforms
          generally interpret and publish the fold changes between
          conditions or strains rather than absolute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels. Therefore this study will focus
          on analysis of fold-change values, hereafter called a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or expression profile.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> common types of values that can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the fold change of a gene. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, a
          signed fold change (such as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1.6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2.3</NUMEX> fold change,
          corresponding to induction or repression, respectively)
          has the most intuitive appeal but has a discontinuity
          spanning from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1.0</NUMEX> that can be problematic. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type, an unsigned fold change (such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX>
          fold change, again corresponding to induction or
          repression, respectively) has no such discontinuity but
          is bounded on the left by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and is unbounded on the
          right. This asymmetry about unity hinders analysis. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> type, a logarithm (base 2, base <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, or natural) of
          the unsigned fold change, is undoubtedly the most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tractable</ENAMEX>. No fold change in expression is represented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX>, induction is positive and repression is negative.
          Most importantly, there are no discontinuities or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetries</ENAMEX>.
          Once a set of transcription profiles is obtained
          (where each profile represents a set of fold changes for
          a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), a data matrix can be generated with
          genes as rows and experiments as columns (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>).
          With this picture in mind, generating vectors from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data matrix</ENAMEX> (the logarithms of the unsigned fold changes)
          is a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> for which there is an obvious
          construction.
          
          Definition. For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> transcription profiles measuring
          the expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> genes, let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ij</ENAMEX>  represent the logarithm of the
          expression of the 
          i th gene in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">j th</ENAMEX> experiment. The vector
          [s 
          
          i 1 s 
          
          i 2 ...s 
          
            ip 
           ] T
          is defined as a 'gene vector'. Similarly,
          
          is defined as an 'experiment vector'. By construction,
          a gene vector is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -dimensional</ENAMEX> and an experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -dimensional.</ENAMEX> An 'expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>' represents either a gene vector or an experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. The superscript <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tdesignates</ENAMEX> transposition.
          It can easily be seen that with respect to the data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>, a gene vector consists of the elements of a row
          and an experiment vector consists of the elements of a
          column (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). By convention, vectors are treated as
          columns and not as rows. Experiment vectors are already
          columns, so gene vectors are transposed from rows to also
          become columns.
          In the most common scheme of comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> profiles, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'cloud'</ENAMEX> of genes is plotted on a scatterplot. This view
          is simply the display of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> two-dimensional gene vectors
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). It is well suited to detecting particular
          genes whose expression varies between experiments. As
          more experiments are added to the matrix, the dimension
          of the space grows but the number of points remains
          fixed. Considering a large number of experiments, genes
          that have similar biological regulation remain in nearby
          regions of high-dimensional spaces. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> with
          promoter-sequence analysis and consideration of chromatin
          structure, the study of gene vectors is useful in studies
          of transcription regulation.
          There is another, complementary, way of thinking about
          expression profiles, or more generally, about
          multivariate statistical data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Although analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene vectors</ENAMEX> is a powerful tool, it is less efficient at
          demonstrating relationships between profiles. This is
          because overlaying clouds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of gene vectors
          may not offer an insightful picture because of the many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points in view. In the alternative method of
          analysis, an expression profile is regarded as just one
          point in a high-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. Because this point
          captures the same information contained in the
          scatterplot of gene vectors, the point must reside in a
          much higher-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. In this space, the
          relationships between profiles become more apparent.
          Instead of plotting genes, one now plots experiments
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). As new profiles are added to the data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>, the dimension of the space remains fixed but the
          number of points increases, the reverse case of gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. Although the high-dimensional space of
          experiment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> cannot be visualized, the
          relationships of vectors in the space can often be
          understood using intuition from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three-dimensional</ENAMEX> case. The power of vector algebra comes
          from its ability to scale - the concepts, equations and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theorems</ENAMEX> move seamlessly (usually identically) to higher
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>.
          Assuming that there are 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> genes represented on the
          microarray, it is theoretically possible that each
          profile would yield an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -dimensional</ENAMEX> experiment vector.
          However, because of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of scarce transcripts,
          flaws on the microarray or experimental error, an
          expression profile in practice gives fewer than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> values. This leaves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> basic
          options for how to carry out the analysis. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
          that a lack of data can be declared as no change in
          expression, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> inserted into the position of that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. This approach is generally too simplistic for use
          in further analysis.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> option is to estimate the missing value on
          the basis of other profiles and insert it into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. For example, we can look for the gene most
          similar to the missing gene as judged by all other
          experiments, and then replace the missing value with the
          value of the similar gene for that experiment. For
          robustness, we can also find the most similar 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and use the average of
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for that experiment as the replacement. A
          comparative study has found that this 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> method
          performs better than filling missing values with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zeros</NUMEX> or
          the averages of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in other experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          There are more complicated imputation methods in the
          statistics literature, but their usefulness, given the
          complex calculations involved, is not yet clear.
          Finally, the vector space can be resized to a smaller
          dimension than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , where the expression profiles
          of interest have data for all genes in that space. As the
          missing data are not estimated, this is the most
          conservative method of analysis, although at the price of
          discarding some data.
        
        
          Vector angle is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation coefficient
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most fundamental measures in statistics is
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient (referred to as 
          r ). This represents a widely used
          measure of similarity between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> -tuples. With expression vectors,
          the geometric picture of similarity is that the vectors
          are pointing in the same direction of expression space.
          This picture is equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors with a small
          angle between them. When expression vectors are
          uncorrelated, they are orthogonal. This leads to the
          following remark.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Remark 1</ENAMEX>. Correlation of expression
          vectors corresponds to the angle Î¸ between those vectors.
          Low angle ( 
          r near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) implies correlation,
          Angle near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90Â°</NUMEX> ( 
          r near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) implies uncorrelation,
          and angle near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">180Â°</NUMEX> ( 
          r near <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>) implies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anticorrelation</ENAMEX>.
          This remark is motivated by consideration of the
          relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient
          ( 
          r ) and vector angle (Î¸). (We use
          the notation where <, > represents an inner
          product, also called a dot product, and where cov(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>) is
          the covariance between ordered 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> -tuples.) For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors 
          x and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , the formulas for 
          r and Î¸ are:
          
          It is evident that 
          r and the argument of the inverse
          cosine function are identical except that covariance and
          inner product are interchanged. In practice, the argument
          to the inverse cosine and 
          r are nearly identical because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariance</ENAMEX> is essentially a mean adjusted inner product
          and the means of expression vectors are near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. (In
          fact, covariance and inner product are identical for
          vectors with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> mean.) Thus, there is no advantage of
          either measure because of nearly identical performance on
          actual expression data (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>).
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene vectors</ENAMEX>, angles are a measure of how similar
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are expressed across experiments. For
          experiment vectors, angles are a measure of how similar
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments are across genes. For experiment vectors,
          a quantitative sense of the distribution of Î¸ can be
          obtained by examining a collection of diverse
          transcription profiles. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> transcription
          profiles in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae from a wide variety
          of gene deletions and treatments was obtained and made
          publicly available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. We converted these profiles
          into experiment vectors and computed all possible angles
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the vectors</TIMEX> (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,850</NUMEX> angles). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer</ENAMEX>
          source written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matlabâ„</ENAMEX>¢ is publicly available at our
          website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]) These angles gave a distribution with a
          mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">88.4Â°</NUMEX> (close to orthogonal, as expected) and a
          standard deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.4Â°</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). In practice, we
          have found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60Â° and 120Â°</NUMEX> as useful cutoff values for
          significance of correlation or anticorrelation,
          respectively.
          The vector algebra approach is illustrated using a
          publicly available data set. The small molecule rapamycin
          has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptionally</ENAMEX> profiled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> research
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 11, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. It has
          a very dramatic expression profile in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
          genes are rapidly (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>) up- or down-regulated.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets of rapamycin (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) are
          known to sense nutrients. When treated as an experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>, other experiment vectors were searched for that
          had a low angle with the rapamycin vector. Against the
          same set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> diverse expression profiles described
          earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], not a single vector could be found that
          had an angle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 60Â°</NUMEX> with the rapamycin experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> (data not shown). However another study identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors with smaller angles to the rapamycin
          expression vector (angles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44Â° and 47Â°</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. These
          similar vectors were those corresponding to the removal
          of high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> or nitrogen from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Thus,
          it can be inferred that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> regulate the
          responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>- and nitrogen-quality of the medium.
          This is an example of using angles to identify the
          functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized proteins</ENAMEX>.
          It is apparent that angles provide a quantitative
          measure for asserting genome-wide similarities. This
          measure is important when making claims about the target
          of a small molecule, effects of gene deletion or
          specificity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Orthogonal angles (implying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncorrelation</ENAMEX>) when similarity is expected or claimed
          raise questions about the validity of the hypothesis
          under examination.
        
        
          A ratio of magnitudes is a natural second metric
          for comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expression vectors
          An advantage of vector algebra is the extension from
          angles into ratios of magnitudes for which other
          formulations have awkward or no counterparts. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          four-dimensional vectors 
          x = [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 0 2 -1</NUMEX>] Tand 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 0 4 -2</NUMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thave</ENAMEX> Î¸ = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (implying 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, there is an
          important difference between the vectors not identified
          by these measures, as we can observe that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          x . This information is captured by
          computing the ratio of vector magnitudes.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Remark 2</ENAMEX>. Besides angle, the ratio
          of vector magnitudes (Î±) is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> measure of
          similarity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expression vectors. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors 
          x and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , this is calculated as:
          
          With the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> four-dimensional vectors listed above, Î±
          is easily seen to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. By interchanging < , > and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cov</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> ) as was done with 
          r and Î¸, it is tempting to think
          that the quantity 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î²</ENAMEX> = (cov( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> )/cov( 
          x , 
          x )) 1/2might behave similarly to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> . With the same vectors as above,
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î²</ENAMEX> = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î±</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. When considering the two
          vectors 
          x = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 2 2 2</NUMEX>] Tand 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 1 2</NUMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, it can be calculated
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î±</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>, the value expected as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> is a 'smaller' vector. However 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î²</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5/0</NUMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">âˆž</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtraction</ENAMEX> component of the covariance fundamentally
          alters the behavior of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²</NUMEX> compared to Î±, making it an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unsuitable</ENAMEX> measure of expression vector magnitude. An
          elegant feature of regarding microarray data as
          expression vectors is that both angles and magnitudes are
          natural measurements with important biological meaning,
          as will be discussed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> sections.
        
        
          Searching subspaces is an important step in
          analyzing expression vectors
          Another advantage to treating expression data as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> in a space rather than as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -tuples</ENAMEX> is the associated notion
          of subspaces. With experiment vectors, this concept is
          particularly valuable. Experiment vector space can be
          divided into subspaces, most naturally where the
          subspaces correspond to co-regulated or functionally
          related genes. This can most easily be done using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> lists where genes are classified by function.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Center for Protein</ENAMEX> Sequences
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>) provides a commonly used functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grouping</ENAMEX> for
          genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          Considering subspaces is nearly always an essential
          part of analysis. From the vantage point of certain
          subspaces, many different experiment vectors may
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'collapse</ENAMEX>' into identical vectors. This enables the
          decomposition of vectors into sums of common and distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> stress responses (such as
          DNA damage or heat shock) are composed of a general
          response that stresses share and a specific response for
          the particular stress faced. Identification of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subspaces</ENAMEX> remains a goal in biology. Another example is
          that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which have many effectors, one
          of which is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ure2p</ENAMEX>. Comparing the expression
          vectors of rapamycin treatment with a 
          URE2 deletion reveals that the
          genome-wide angle between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76Â°</NUMEX> and
          thus the vectors show only weak correlation. However,
          calculating the angle of these same vectors within the
          subspace of genes controlled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ure2p</TIMEX> gives an angle of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13Â°</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. With respect to this subspace of genes,
          treatment with rapamycin and deletion of 
          URE2 are nearly identical.
          Experiments reveal that treatment with rapamycin leads to
          dephosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ure2p</TIMEX>, corroborating this low angle
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 21</ENAMEX>]. Thus it is important to consider not only
          whole-genome angles, but also those for important
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subspaces</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The effects of mutations on vector angles and
          magnitudes
          When studying a particular process by transcription
          profiling, it is common also to transcriptionally profile
          the same process after deleting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known
          to be involved. For example, this has been carried out
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase deletion mutants</ENAMEX> after pheromone
          treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], deletions of effectors of the Tor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> after rapamycin treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], and 
          lexA deletions after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> irradiation
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
          When an effector of some process is deleted, the
          resulting vector is often not uncorrelated in the
          subspace involving that effector, but is reduced in
          magnitude. For example, when there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcription
          factors with overlapping specificity for some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          deletion of one can be compensated by the presence of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> with a similar (though weaker) induction of the
          same genes. If an effector truly is an exclusive
          controller of some set of genes, when it is deleted, the
          resulting experiment vector in that subspace would be
          expected to be orthogonal (uncorrelated) with the
          original vector. However, biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> generally
          exhibit redundancy in their control of genes - a
          reduction in the vector magnitude is to be more commonly
          expected than rotation toward perpendicularity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">uncorrelation</NUMEX>). Thus it is important to rely on the
          coordinate use of angles and magnitudes in
          expression-profiling analysis, something that is not
          always performed in the literature.
        
        
          Combined use of angles and ratios of vector
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magnitudes</ENAMEX> is a tool for biological discovery
          When one is characterizing a transcription profile of
          an uncharacterized gene deletion or treatment with a
          small molecule, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> that should
          ordinarily be completed is a comparison of that profile
          as an experiment vector with all other available
          experiment vectors from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. By performing
          such a comparison, the gene can be partially
          characterized or the target of a small molecule can be
          identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. By coloring the results of a
          comparison, mimicking the false-coloring schemes usually
          found on microarrays, one can quickly scan a large set of
          profiles for those correlated, uncorrelated, or
          anticorrelated with a reference profile that is being
          tested [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. This color scheme is red to represent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX>, yellow to represent uncorrelation, and green
          to represent anticorrelation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depiction</ENAMEX> is called a colorimetric comparison array
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCA</ENAMEX>). It can also be carried out with ratios of vector
          magnitudes where red represents greater magnitude, yellow
          unchanged magnitude, and green reduced magnitude.
          To understand the most general relationships, it is
          useful in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first row</TIMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCA</ENAMEX> to compare
          whole-experiment vectors. This gives an important
          genome-wide characterization of the profiles being
          studied - assertions of global behavior should be
          substantiated in these values. As previously discussed,
          the angles and magnitudes within subspaces are important
          to analyze - in subsequent rows, therefore, the same
          experiment vectors are compared in various subspaces of
          the genome. By examining a range of subspaces, this
          analysis can be used to partition a transcription profile
          and define which effectors are responsible for particular
          patterns of expression. By looking at whole-genome angles
          as well as angles within subspaces of interest, the CCA
          reveals a wealth of information about the expression
          vectors being studied (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCA</ENAMEX> can also be used
          to identify the structure of signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Singular value decomposition in expression-profile
          analysis
          We next explore ideas relating to dimensionality
          reduction of expression vectors. Dimensionality reduction
          is a common problem in many disciplines of science and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>. Questions include: what are the essential
          pieces of information within a transcription profile and
          what is noise? If the full set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 6,000</NUMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> ) carries redundant
          information, how small a subset can we choose? Are most
          transcription profiles merely combinations of a smaller
          number of transcription profiles? The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tool we
          discuss is singular value decomposition (SVD).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matrix factorization</ENAMEX> that reveals many
          important properties of a matrix. It is a standard tool
          in many areas of the physical sciences, and many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix algebra</ENAMEX> make use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>. Given an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          p rectangular data matrix 
          A 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>  of expression profiles
          (again where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of genes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> is the number of experiments), we
          can obtain the following factorization:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> are orthonormal and 
          D is diagonal. (Mathematical details
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods.) The
          intuition behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is straightforward. Let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           be the 
          i th column of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> . Note that this column vector is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -dimensional.</ENAMEX> The best vector (in
          a sense that can be made mathematically precise, see
          Materials and methods) that captures (spans) the
          experiment vectors of 
          A is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Similarly, the best <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> column
          vectors that span the experiment vectors of 
          A are 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In the limit, all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> vectors 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           exactly span all the experiment vectors of 
          A . In the same way, the columns of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> , in descending order, are 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -dimensional</ENAMEX> vectors that best
          span the gene vectors of 
          A . These ideas are best illustrated
          with an example.
          
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 best spans</TIMEX> (that is, when multiplied
          by a constant) the columns of 
          A . Together with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column, 
          A is exactly captured by taking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> combinations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In this case, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> are not needed to capture 
          A . Similarly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> , 
          v 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> best spans the gene vectors (rows)
          of 
          A . The first value along the
          diagonal of 
          D measures how much contribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          v 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> make to capturing 
          A , and the next value measures how
          much contribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and 
          v 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> make. In this case, the large size
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> singular value indicates that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          v 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> capture most of the information in 
          A . These values along the diagonal
          of 
          D are called the singular values of 
          A . Matrices that contain mostly
          redundant columns (low-rank matrices) have singular
          values that rapidly decay, because the matrix is
          efficiently spanned by a small number of vectors.
          However, matrices containing very independent columns
          (high-rank matrices) have singular values that slowly
          decay. In the limit, the identity matrix, which has the
          highest possible rank of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , has singular values that do not
          decay at all - they all are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
          For microarray data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can be used to bring out
          dominant underlying behaviors. For example, examining the
          cell-cycle data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> revealed that among the
          first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> vectors ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ,...), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> corresponds to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steady-state</ENAMEX> and the subsequent ones correspond to the
          oscillatory behavior that one would expect from such data
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can also be used to 'de-noise' profiles by
          recomputing the data matrix using only significant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> (significance determined by reading the 
          i th singular value along the
          diagonal matrix 
          D .) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can also be used to
          estimate missing values.
          A technique called principal components analysis (PCA)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] is closely related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">factorization</ENAMEX> is applied to the covariance matrix of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> rather than the original data matrix. If the data
          are mean-adjusted, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> give the same
          information. If the data are from a time series, then the
          principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> may correspond to derivatives of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Towards a basis of expression vectors
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most powerful ideas in linear algebra is
          the notion of basis vectors. Besides constructing the
          space, basis vectors can be chosen to highlight important
          features of the data or simply to store the data
          efficiently. For example, the function sin 
          x can be expressed either in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polynomial</ENAMEX> or exponential basis,
          
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> basis is clearly awkward - it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infinite-dimensional</ENAMEX> and offers little insight. However,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> basis captures the sine wave more compactly
          and provides more insight. Many of the successes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> algebra in image compression, smoothing and signal
          detection come from the identification of appropriate
          basis functions.
          This concept has important implications in the
          analysis of transcription-profiling data. Considering the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> as expression vectors, what is the right basis to
          express the data in? The data is originally in the basis
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. But is that the best basis? We have already
          examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> change of basis - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>. In this case, the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           and 
          v 
          
            i 
           vectors are basis vectors for the spaces of
          experiment vectors and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene vectors</ENAMEX>, respectively. While
          very efficient basis vectors, the vectors themselves are
          completely artificial and do not correspond to actual
          profiles.
          An important question in biology is how many different
          fundamental cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or transitions exist. It may
          be that there are a relatively small number, and that
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or transitions are essentially
          superpositions of a finite number of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX>. This question is easily posed in expression
          space because, if the hypothesis holds, the complete set
          of expression profiles can be examined for the smallest
          number of basis vectors that can construct the nearly
          identical entire set. If a profile is added to the data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> and cannot adequately be constructed by other
          existing profiles, then it becomes a basis vector. The
          collection of basis vectors formed by this procedure can
          be thought of as containing the building blocks of
          cellular state or transition space. Thus, it would be
          interesting to try to find basis vectors for all
          experiment vectors, using actual experiment vectors and
          not artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that offer little insight.
          First, how can one estimate how many basis vectors are
          required? This problem corresponds to estimating the rank
          of the data matrix. This problem of finding an
          approximate rank of a matrix, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , is a common one. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>, as
          described above, is often employed. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>, one
          typically looks for a sharp drop in the singular values
          to estimate the rank. Let us suppose that the singular
          values fall below a defined threshold at some value. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">value</ENAMEX> serves as a logical choice for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> . In fact, the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k vectors</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           of 
          A serve as the best possible basis to
          span 
          A . In our case, however, we desire
          the basis vectors to be a subset of the original vectors
          of 
          A . This is a more difficult
          problem.
          We investigated these concepts using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large data
          sets of transcription profiles generated in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae : the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          expression profiles previously analyzed and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 170</NUMEX> expression profiles of various yeast
          environmental responses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 28</TIMEX>]. We converted these
          sets to data matrices of experiment vectors and computed
          the singular values of each matrix. For each matrix, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">singular</ENAMEX> values decayed rapidly (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This decay
          shows that the columns of the matrix are far from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthogonal</ENAMEX> and a basis containing a small number of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> can efficiently capture the original matrix.
          Interestingly, the singular value decay of the
          environmental responses was much faster than the more
          diverse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> profile set (compare Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4bwith 4a</ENAMEX>). This
          is due to the limited number of responses that yeast
          cells possess when facing stress. This further suggests
          that there are a small number of building-block
          transitions that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> can undergo and that other
          behaviors are, at least partially, superpositions of
          these transitions.
          But how can one find these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>-block, fundamental
          expression vectors in the profile set? Instead of using
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           vectors from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> (which are linear combinations of
          the experiment vectors) it would be useful to identify
          which actual experiment vectors are most useful to form a
          basis for the matrix. That is, it would be useful to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> profiles in terms of other profiles (basis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>), rather than simply as lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). There are a number of possible algorithms for
          identifying these basis experiment vectors. We tested a
          variety of algorithms, especially those utilizing
          projections of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           vectors on 
          A , to identify optimal candidate
          basis vectors. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> code for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such algorithm is
          publicly available online at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].) While small subsets
          of experiment vectors could span the entire set of
          experiment vectors, it was found that there were many
          such subsets of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> that had a
          comparable spanning ability toward 
          A (data not shown). This suggests
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> probably does have a small number of
          fundamental transitions, although many different groups
          of transitions (as represented by experiment vectors)
          appear nearly equivalently able to span the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> range of cellular behavior.
          Given this behavior, perhaps the ideal basis vectors
          for transition space would be the basis of experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> in which only one signaling pathway is
          selectively modulated. This could be accomplished with
          small molecules like rapamycin that selectively modulate
          one signaling pathway with complete specificity. If one
          had a collection of small molecules that could
          selectively modulate every signaling pathway in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
          then it might be possible to simply project an experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> on these small molecules' experiment vectors and
          determine which pathways are activated and to what
          degree. This would immediately characterize the
          expression profile in a very powerful basis that provides
          a great deal of biological insight.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have described various techniques motivated by vector
        algebra for analyzing genome-wide expression data. Some of
        these techniques have been used previously, but we find
        that by regarding expression profiles as vectors, either in
        the sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or experiments, we gain a richer
        understanding of the existing techniques and can take these
        insights into new directions.
        The angle between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> is essentially equivalent
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient and studying the
        changes in magnitudes as well as the angles provides
        important biological information. In particular, we find
        that decomposing the experiment vector space into a set of
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subspaces</ENAMEX>, using functional categories for
        instance, results in a concise but useful description of
        the biological system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These types of
        genome-wide descriptions are essential for understanding
        large amounts of complex expression data. Thinking in terms
        of vector spaces naturally introduced the idea of optimal
        basis vectors, but with the constraint that these basis
        vectors belong to the original set of expression vectors.
        This may be a useful way of characterizing expression
        profiles. We have described the usefulness of the singular
        value decomposition as a tool for reducing the dimension of
        the problem and the insight it brings to the problem of
        finding basis vectors.
        A complete analysis of genome-wide expression data
        involves numerous issues not discussed here. The importance
        of preprocessing and normalization to correct for various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX> has been noted recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. Artificially
        large fold changes caused by small values in ratios
        (red/green or vice versa) should be numerically bounded in
        competitive hybridization experiments. Assigning a level of
        significance to observed changes in expression levels is
        also an important issue and has been addressed by a number
        of different approaches, most often with a derivation of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> model for noise to obtain estimates for the
        fold changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. For oligonucleotide arrays, there
        are similar and sometimes more complicated issues for the
        same steps. Finally, there are a variety of clustering and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-mining techniques for understanding the structure of
        the data in other ways. Appropriate methods should be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen</ENAMEX> carefully, depending on the type of data and the
        questions to be answered. As the quantity of expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> increases rapidly, more tools such as the ones
        developed here will play an important role in understanding
        biological <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and transitions.

          Singular value decomposition (SVD)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix factorization</ENAMEX>:
          
          where 
          D is diagonal and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> are orthonormal ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UU T</ENAMEX>= 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> =

            p 
           and the columns { 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           } 
          
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n  of</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> and { 
          v 
          
            i 
           } 
          
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p  of</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> are called left and right singular
          vectors, respectively. For microarray data, we assume
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> > 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> as we usually think of the data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> as having 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> rows for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and 
          p rows for experiments, and we
          assume that the columns are linearly independent.
          The geometric visualization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is the
          following. When 
          A 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>  is applied to a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -dimensional</ENAMEX> sphere, the result
          is an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -dimensional</ENAMEX> ellipse in which the
          principal axes have been stretched by factors Ïƒ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,..., Ïƒ 
          
            p 
           in directions 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           
          ,...,u 
          
            p 
           respectively. (The right singular vectors 
          v 
          
            i 
           are the axes of the sphere that get mapped to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           through 
          Av 
          
            i

            i 
           
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           .) The usefulness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is often based on the
          fact that it answers the following important question:
          what is the best approximation to 
          A using a matrix of lower rank? (The
          term 'best' can be defined mathematically.) This is
          important because a comparable matrix with a smaller rank
          may make the underlying structure of the matrix more
          apparent. Another way of writing 
          A = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UDV Tis</ENAMEX>:
          
          Then, it can be shown mathematically that the best
          approximation of dimension 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is obtained by the partial sum of
          the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> terms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Sometimes the terms
          Ïƒ

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>

          v 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tare</ENAMEX> called the 'characteristic modes'. This
          representation is similar to that of a signal by a sum of
          its Fourier modes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can be used to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-noise the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> by recomputing the sum with the small singular
          values set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Measuring basis quality
          Let 
          A be an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p matrix</ENAMEX> where the columns of 
          A represent a collection of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> transcription profiles over 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> genes. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> expression vectors are chosen
          from 
          A as a basis for the complete set.
          Let 
          B be the matrix whose columns consist
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> expression vectors ( 
          B is therefore 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ). The ability of 
          B to form a basis for the remaining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> - k vectors of 
          A (designated 
          x 
          
            i 
           ) is tested by application of the projection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theorem</ENAMEX>. Let 
          P be the projection matrix for 
          B , that is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = 
          B ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B T</ENAMEX> 
          B ) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B T.</ENAMEX> A measure of the spanning
          ability of the basis 
          B toward the 
          x 
          i is:
          
          Until Î³ is below a determined threshold for the
          original matrix 
          A , a different collection of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> expression vectors can be tested
          or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> can be increased to include more
          basis vectors.
          In the expression for Î³, the numerator is the
          'residual vector', the part of the 
          x 
          
            i 
           that could not be captured by 
          B . The normalized magnitude of the
