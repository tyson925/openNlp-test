        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection is currently the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leading cause of
        death in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-44 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and manifestations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection show important gender-dependent differences.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> frequently develop menstrual abnormalities with
        amenorrhea, and manifestations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> occur at higher CD4
        counts and lower viral load as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> levels are also lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        It remains unclear if dementia associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection occurs more frequently in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. A large
        multicenter <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> study showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were twice as
        likely to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> dementia compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>];
        however, another study failed to confirm these differences
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drug</ENAMEX> abuse accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>[ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], however, the
        effect of drug abuse on incidence, rate of progression or
        severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> dementia is not entirely clear. Although no
        major differences were noted in cognitive functioning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amongst HIV-infected</ENAMEX> asymptomatics with or without a
        history of drug abuse [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], a subsequent study showed that
        a history of injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use and presentation with
        prominent psychomotor slowing was associated with more
        rapid neurologic progression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Other neuropathological
        studies show marked sever ity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> encephalitis in drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abusers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] particularly involving loss of dopaminergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Long term methamphetamine use has also been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with neuronal damage as determined by magnetic
        resonance spectroscopy brain imaging studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Autopsy
        studies also confirm injury to dopaminergic neurons in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> as well or methamphetamine abusers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        Interestingly, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have proposed the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">psychostimulants</ENAMEX> in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> dementia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
        however the effects of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on cerebral function in
        the setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection has not been well studied.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins gp120</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> have been implicated in the
        neuropathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV dementia</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        released from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected cells and are present in the
        brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Recent studies from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> have
        shown that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> cause synergistic neurotoxicity
        that involves excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptors</ENAMEX> and oxidative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Estrogen deficiency</ENAMEX> has been implicated as a risk factor
        in the development of several neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18</TIMEX>] and estrogen replacement may result in
        improvement of cognitive function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The mechanisms by
        which estrogens protect neurons is currently under intense
        investigation and may involve, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated mechanisms
        or non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated antioxidative effects. For these
        reasons, we assessed the combined effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse, methamphetamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> on neuronal
        function and determined to what extent estrogen may protect
        against these neurotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX> and dopaminergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in human fetal brain cells
          Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were localized in the neuronal
          cultures by immunostaining and by mRNA analysis by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> cells immunostained for
          estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> could be localized
          in both neurons and astrocytes (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Band 2D-F</ENAMEX>).
          The immunostaining was noted in the cytoplasm and nucleus
          of these cells. mRNA for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor-Î±</ENAMEX> but not
          estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-Î² could be detected in these cultures
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Dopaminergic neurons were detected by
          immunostaining for dopamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dopamine</ENAMEX> transporter
          which could be co-localized in nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A-C</TIMEX>) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dopamine receptors</ENAMEX>: D1A (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          cells) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> cells) (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2F</ENAMEX>). Estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor colocalized</ENAMEX> with cells staining for dopamine
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptor</ENAMEX> containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Eand 2F</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Blocking of neurotoxicity of supernatants from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          infected monocytes with antisera to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gp120</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX>
          Cell culture supernatants from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected monocytic
          cells were collected periodically and analyzed for their
          neurotoxic potential. Maximum neurotoxicity was noted at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> post infection (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). Complete
          obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted when the
          supernatants were immunoabsorbed against antisera to
          gp120 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). However, when immunoabsorbed
          against each of the antisera alone, the effect on
          neurotoxicity of the culture supernatants was not
          significant (not shown).
        
        
          Neurotoxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with methamphetamine
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>
          To determine the synergistic neurotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
          the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse, we initially
          conducted time and dose response curves for each compound
          individually and then in combination of one another. We
          determined that dosages for causing neuronal cell death
          or changes in mitochondrial potential paralleled one
          another, however changes in mitochondrial potential could
          be seen as early as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-8 hours</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), significant
          cell death occurred at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> hrs post treatment. No
          significant toxicity was noted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat <80</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nM</ENAMEX>, gp120
          <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pM, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 nM</NUMEX>) + gp120 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 pM</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          To determine the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> action, we used a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tat deletion mutants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”31-61</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”48-56</ENAMEX>). No
          changes in neuronal cell death were noted at maximal
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”31-61</ENAMEX> tested (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 nM</NUMEX>) and partial
          obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TatÎ”48</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These observations are consistent with our
          previous experience with synthetic Tat peptides
          demonstrating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat31-61</ENAMEX> contains the neurotoxic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. To determine the specificity of gp120
          action we used a non-specific glycoprotein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±2</NUMEX>-HS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>. No neurotoxicity was detected at the
          highest concentrations tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>).
          Similarly, no significant neurotoxicity was noted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">methamphetamine <500 Î¼M</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). In addition, all
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> tested were non-toxic by these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. The maximal concentration tested was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 uM</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> nM
          Tat + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> pM <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 Î¼M</NUMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methamphetamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î¼M</NUMEX>) produced significant (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) neuronal cell death (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>) and
          decreases in mitochondrial potential in each case (Figure
          5C). When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> was combined with either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 pM gp120</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> Î¼M methamphetamine or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, significant
          decreases in mitochondrial potential (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) were
          observed demonstrating a synergistic neurotoxic response
          between the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse. The
          synergism for both methamphetamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> showed a
          steep dose response suggesting an "all or none"
          phenomenon (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-induced
          mitochondrial toxicity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol
          We determined the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol to protect
          against the synergistic neurotoxicity induced by the
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> alone or in combination with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methamphetamine</ENAMEX>. Nearly complete attenuation of neuronal
          cell death induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp120</NUMEX> was noted in a
          concentration dependent manner (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol could also protect against the combined
          synergistic neurotoxicity of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp120 30</NUMEX> pM) with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 Î¼M</NUMEX>) or methamphetamine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 nM 17Î²-estradiol</TIMEX> protected against
          both, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure
          8Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">8B</ENAMEX>) and neuronal cell death (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8C</NUMEX>). However,
          this toxicity of higher concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 Î¼M</NUMEX>)
          could be only partially reversed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8B</NUMEX>). A lower concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX>) could also completely reverse the changes in
          mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8Aand 8B</ENAMEX>) but
          not cell death (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). To determine the mechanism of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> action, we pretreated the cells with either ICI
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182,780</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M or 10 Î¼M</NUMEX>) or tamoxifen (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM). We
          tried several different combinations and concentrations
          of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and methamphetamine or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>.
          Although protection with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol was consistently
          present, in each case the estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> failed to
          reverse the protective effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol on
          mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8Aand 8B</ENAMEX>).
          Interestingly, however, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICI 182,780</NUMEX>, a prototypic
          estrogen antagonist, blocked the protective effect of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol on neuronal cell death (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> had only a partial effect that was not
          significant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8D</NUMEX>). Both <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICI 182,780</NUMEX> and tamoxifen
          alone did not produce neurotoxicity at the above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8D</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Although it is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection
        may develop dementia and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected drug abusers
        develop evidence for neuronal dysfunction, it is not
        clearly established if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exposed to both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse are at increased risk for neurological
        complications. In this study, we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may
        synergize with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as methamphetamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> to
        cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX>. These findings are supported by recent
        observations suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abusers</ENAMEX> have
        a more severe encephalitis at autopsy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>] and at
        least in some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected drug abusers an accelerated form
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> dementia may be observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible cause
        of this acceleration may be the synergistic neurotoxic
        properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> also suggest that an acute exposure may be
        sufficient to cause neurotoxicity. The mechanism by which
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> synergize remains elusive. As demonstrated
        in these studies, at least in part the mechanism involves
        mitochondrial dysfunction. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both gp120</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> have
        been shown to cause toxicity to dopaminergic cells and
        similarly methamphetamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> also cause toxicity
        to dopaminergic systems, we characterized the dopaminergic
        cell types and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in our culture system. We found
        that only a small proportion of these cells underwent cell
        death when exposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse
        suggesting that there must be another susceptibility factor
        that characterizes these cells which needs to be
        identified.
        We demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins gp120</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> are
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected cells
        that cause neurotoxicity. This does not exclude the role of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> such as cytokines and other soluble
        cellular products implicated in neuropathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection. In fact previous studies have shown that most of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> can be induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        uninfected monocytes and astrocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Although further
        studies are necessary to determine the relative amounts and
        kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> released from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infected cells, previous studies have shown that both gp120
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> are present in the brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> and encephalitis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 22</TIMEX>]. Gp120 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> may also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergize</ENAMEX> to cause neurotoxicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Recently, much attention has been given to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroprotective</ENAMEX> properties of estrogens for both chronic
        neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and acute insults such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. In vitro studies also show that estrogens can
        protect against a number of neurotoxic compounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The
        mechanisms by which estrogens protect cells can be broadly
        classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor mediated</ENAMEX> and
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated effects. Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are
        widely expressed in the brain with some regional
        differences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. We initially demonstrated the presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX> in the neuronal cultures by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX> and determined their subtypes by mRNA
        analysis. We found that estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are localized
        both in neurons and astrocytes. We also found that some
        dopaminergic neurons co-expressed estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        We next determined that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol at concentrations
        that can either be achieved physiologically or easily
        obtained pharmacologically protected against the combined
        insult of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and drug abuse. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection</ENAMEX> was noted
        against both cell death and mitochondrial toxicity. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> was specific since no protection was noted with
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17Î±-estradiol.</TIMEX> In subsequent experiments we determined if
        this protection was mediated via estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICI 182,780</NUMEX> completely, and
        tamoxifen partially reversed the neuroprotective effects of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol using cell death as an end point. However
        these compounds were unable to reverse the neuroprotective
        effects of estrogen on mitochondrial potential, suggesting
        that the mitochondrial effects of estrogen are non-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX>. Thus the toxic effects on mitochondria and
        neuronal cell survival seems to be independently regulated.
        However, it seems that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol can protect against
        both these effects by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> mediated
        mechanisms. These observations are consistent with recent
        reports showing that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol interacts directly with
        a subunit of mitochondrial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F0F1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase/ATPase
        required for the coupling of a proton gradient across the
        F0 sector of the enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthesis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F1</TIMEX> sector of the enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. This
        accounts for the antioxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol.
        Due to its multiple sites of action, its wide spectrum of
        protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple neurotoxic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> at easily
        obtainable concentrations and the ease of administration of
        estrogen, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is a very attractive candidate for
        consideration for therapeutic intervention in HIV-infected
        drug abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Clinical trials are now necessary to
        confirm these observations. Caution may be necessary in the
        use of estrogens in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrogens</ENAMEX> have
        been associated with a small but real risk of ischemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> and cerebral infarcts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Some patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection may have a hypercoagulable state and may
        be at increased risk of developing cerebral infarcts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>].
        We conclude that methamphetamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> may
        synergize with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to cause neurotoxicity and
        resulting in increased dysfunction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Caution should also be used in the use of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">structurally</ENAMEX> and functionally similar psychotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Estrogen may be neuroprotective in
        this population acting through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and non-receptor
        mediated mechanisms.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cultures of human brain cells
          Brain specimens were obtained from human fetuses of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-14 weeks</TIMEX> gestational age with consent from women
          undergoing elective termination of pregnancy and approval
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>.
          Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 28</TIMEX>]. Briefly, the cells were mechanically
          dissociated, suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Opti</ENAMEX>-MEM with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> N2 supplement
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIBCO</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic solution</ENAMEX> (penicillin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4units/ml, streptomycin 10 mg/ml</ENAMEX> and amphotericin B <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) and plated in flat bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well plates</ENAMEX>. The
          cells were maintained in culture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one month</TIMEX>
          before conducting the neurotoxicity and mitochondrial
          experiments.
        
        
          Immunostaining
          Cells were plated and cultured on coverslips for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was removed and neuronal
          cultures were fixed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamboni</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fixative</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] at room temperature. Receptor
          immunoreactivity was determined using monoclonal or
          polyclonal antisera as listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> in blocking buffer consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> casein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> bovine serum albumin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) in phosphate
          buffered saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) at pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.4</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">min. Cells</ENAMEX> were
          then incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking
          buffer for at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three washes</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          the cells were incubated with fluorochrome conjugated
          secondary antisera diluted in blocking buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> at room temperature. To determine
          specificity of staining, some cells were incubated in
          blocking buffer without primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In addition,
          the specificity of particular antibodies was further
          confirmed by demonstrating appropriate patterns of
          subcellular immunoreactivity in positive controls, as
          well as the absence of immunoreactivity in negative
          controls. After the final wash, the coverslips containing
          cells were air dried in the dark and mounted on slides
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ProLong â„¢Antifade</ENAMEX> mounting media (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sakura</ENAMEX> Finitek
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrence</ENAMEX>, CA). They were maintained in the dark and
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C until</TIMEX> examined.
        
        
          Combined detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopaminergic</ENAMEX> systems
          Neuronal cultures plated on coverslips were initially
          treated as described above to detect estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
          Cell were fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zamboni</ENAMEX>'s solution, rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and incubated with mouse anti-ERÎ± or ERÎ² monoclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10 dilution</TIMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> h at room
          temperature. Anti <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse IgG</ENAMEX> conjugated to Cy3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorochrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:250 dilution, 1</ENAMEX> h at room temperature)
          was used to visualize <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> antigenicity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson</ENAMEX>
          ImmunoResearch, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Grove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). To detect dopamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DA</ENAMEX>),
          dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors D1A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2</ENAMEX>, cells were incubated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit polyclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (see table) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at
          4Â°C. For detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dopamine</ENAMEX> transporter (DAT) rat
          monoclonal antisera were used. Cells were then incubated
          in goat anti rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:250 dilution</ENAMEX>) conjugated to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTAF</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> at room temperature. Cells were washes three
          times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. After the final wash, the coverslips
          containing cells were air dried in the dark and
          coverslipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ProLong â„¢Antifade</ENAMEX> mounting media
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sakura Finitek USA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrence</ENAMEX>, CA). They were maintained
          in the dark and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C until</TIMEX> examined.
          The reaction was visualized using fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon Diaphot</ENAMEX>) and images acquired using a
          Spot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> digital camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sterling</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> images incorporating multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorochromes</ENAMEX> (red and green) were overlaid in Photoshop
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX>
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification.
            We utilized well characterized RT-PCR methods to
            determine relative changes in gene expression at the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> level. For each gene examined, we generated
            standard curves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">input RNA</ENAMEX> and cycle number to
            determine the optimum cycle number within the linear
            range for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification (data not shown); for all
            genes examined, this was determined to be between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-30</NUMEX>
            cycles. These methods have been validated in studies
            showing that, within the optimal range of
            amplification, yields of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product are linear with
            respect to input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
            For each gene, stock solutions were prepared
            containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 , 1X</TIMEX> reaction buffer, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼Ci</NUMEX> of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>). For 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ERÎ² PCR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U of Taq Ab</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) was included in each reaction. The stock
            solution was aliquoted (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">49 Î¼l/tube</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/30</NUMEX> of
            synthesized cDNA (from reverse transcription reaction)
            was added to each sample tube. Samples were then
            thermocycled for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybaid, Touchdown</ENAMEX>
            Thermocycler, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middlesex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>) according to
            the following reaction conditions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min 95Â°C, 1 min</ENAMEX>
            55Â°C, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 min 72Â°C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>). After amplification,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>. The gels were dried and the products
            were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, CA).
            All the oligonucleotide sequence pairs used for gene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> in this study generated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products of

          Infection of monocytic cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          THP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> and infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AdaM</ENAMEX> strain at an MOI of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.
          The high MOI was chosen to ensure maximal production of
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Culture supernatants were collected every
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and frozen at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-80Â°C</NUMEX> till
          used for neurotoxicity assays. For immunoabsorption of
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the culture supernatants were incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> min with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A beads conjugated with
          polyclonal antisera to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp120</NUMEX> with constant
          shaking at room temperature. Following centrifugation,
          the supernatants were removed and immediately used for
          neurotoxicity assays.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant Tat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gp120 proteins</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant Tat</ENAMEX> was prepared as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>] with minor modifications. The 
          tat gene encoding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 72</TIMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were amplified from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>

          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> repository at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> and inserted into
          an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PinPoint</ENAMEX> Xa-2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> from this plasmid were
          also prepared. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> by deleting the sequence encoding

          neurotoxic epitope [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Another one was prepared by
          deleting the sequences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48-56</NUMEX> encoding the basic region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. These constructs allowed the expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as a fusion protein naturally biotinylated at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biotinylated Tat proteins</ENAMEX> were
          purified on a column of soft release avidin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>,
          cleaved from the fusion protein using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Xa</ENAMEX> and
          eluted from the column followed by desalting with a PD10
          column. All purification steps contained dithiothreitol
          to prevent oxidation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat proteins</ENAMEX> were
          ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> pure as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE followed by silver

          single symmetrical peak. Western blot analysis showed
          that these preparations contained both monomeric and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimeric</ENAMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat1-72</ENAMEX> but monomeric form only for
          TatÎ”31-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”48-56</ENAMEX>. The functional activity of
          Tat1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> was confirmed using a transactivation assay in
          HL3T1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 LTR-CAT</ENAMEX> construct [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          gp120 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> 
          SF2 was obtained as a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant gp120</ENAMEX> was made in a chinese
          hamster ovary cell line and purification yielded a

          analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> preparations contained <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pg/ml</ENAMEX> endotoxin as determined using a Pyrochrome
          Chromogenic test kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cod Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          Falmouth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>.). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat proteins</ENAMEX> were stored in a
          lyophilized form and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> as a stock solution in water
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-80Â°C</NUMEX> in endotoxin-free siliconized microfuge tubes
          until taken for experimentation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> were
          highly susceptible to degradation and loss of biological
          activity with each freeze-thaw cycle. Therefore, single
          aliquots were used for each experiment with the remaining
          solutions discarded.
        
        
          Neurotoxicity Assay
          At the time of experimental treatment, the culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> was replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer containing (in mM)

          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.2</NUMEX>) and neurons were incubated with culture supernatants
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected monocytic cells, subtoxic
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 nM</NUMEX>) + gp120 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 pM</NUMEX>), various
          concentrations of methamphetamine or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, or viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins + methamphetamine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>. To determine the
          specificity of action of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat1-72</ENAMEX> was
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”31-61</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TatÎ”48-56</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nM
          concentration each. Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 pM</NUMEX>) was
          compared to a non-specific glycoprotein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±2</NUMEX>-HS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 uM</ENAMEX>). Cell death in each case was
          monitored by trypan blue exclusion <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours later</TIMEX> as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 28</TIMEX>]. Neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts were
          determined from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fields at predetermined coordinate
          locations. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> was photographed, coded and
          counted. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 200</NUMEX> cells were counted in each field.
          Each experiment was conducted in triplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent experiments were conducted with
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacological agent</ENAMEX>. The means and standard errors
          of the mean were calculated and data were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tukey-Kramer</ENAMEX> post-hoc comparisons. To
          investigate the neuroprotective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of estrogen,
          the cells were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) at
          various concentrations followed by exposure to the viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer and
          cell death monitored as described above. Preincubation
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>-estradiol in each case was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><5</NUMEX> min. To
          determine the mechanism of estrogen protection, the
          cultures were incubated with either <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICI 182,780</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 nM</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tocris</ENAMEX>) or tamoxifen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 nM</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
          activity
          To determine the effect of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on
          mitochondrial function, we used a fluorescent dye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JC-1</ENAMEX> to
          measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Once
          loaded into the mitochondria, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JC-1</ENAMEX> undergoes aggregate
          formation in the regions of high potential. The resulting
          spectral shift of the dye can be used to detect changes
          in mitochondrial activity. The green fluorescent JC-1
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,5</NUMEX>',
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,6</NUMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tetrachloro</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,1</NUMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3,3</NUMEX>'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcabocyanine
          iodine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-3168</ENAMEX>) exist as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> at low membrane
          potential. However, at higher potentials, JC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> forms red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescent</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX>-aggregates" that exhibit broad spectrum
          and an emission maximum at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590</NUMEX> nm. Optical filters
          designed for fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine were
          used to separately visualize the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>-aggregate
          forms, respectively. Mitochondrial function was monitored
          following treatment with the above compounds at different
          concentrations and time points. Briefly, after experiment
          treatment cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in
          a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JC-1</ENAMEX> and then washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s solution.
          Optical measurements were acquired with excitation at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">485</NUMEX> nm and emission at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">527</NUMEX> nm, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590</NUMEX> nm. The levels of
          fluorescence at both emission wavelengths were quantified
          and ratio of measurements was assessed. The pertinent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are given as mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.E.M.</ENAMEX> for mean optical
          measurements. The values are expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> of the
          mean control values Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.E.M.</ENAMEX> and analyzed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>.
