        Cell-fate changes that occur during development are
        almost always accompanied by changes in gene expression.
        Thus detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal
        expression patterns for all genes will be an important step
        in deciphering the complex regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> governing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> methods have been used successfully to determine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns on a large scale - <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
        in situ hybridization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Whole-mount <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
        in situ hybridization is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-established</ENAMEX> approach for determining precise spatial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>], and can be done in
        high-throughput fashion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
        in situ hybridization is carried out
        on fixed tissues, examining a large number of differently
        staged specimens provides an overview of the dynamic
        changes in gene-expression patterns that occur during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Expression patterns can be documented by
        microscopy coupled to digital photography and distributed
        on the web as a valuable resource to the research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
        Approaches using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have been successful in
        studying genome-wide transcriptional regulation during
        animal development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>], but suffer from several
        limitations. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multicellular organisms</ENAMEX>, cell division and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiation</ENAMEX> leads to an increase in tissue complexity
        throughout development, but whole-animal microarray
        analysis cannot document this spatial information. One can
        attempt to isolate mRNA from every tissue at different
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>, measure gene expression, and assign
        expression indexes to every tissue at every time for every
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, in order to recreate the entire developmental
        expression pattern. This is a formidable task. Moreover,
        the quantitative comparison of expression levels for a
        given gene, or among different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, in multiple
        experiments is complicated by differential hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> and cross-hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of each
        target-probe pair [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. On the other hand, microarray
        profiles do provide a quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overview</ENAMEX> of the relative
        changes in each gene's expression level across time.
        We used high-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
        in situ hybridization to assemble a
        database of gene-expression patterns during embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development of</ENAMEX> 
        Drosophila melanogaster. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones
        are available for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of all 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>],
        providing a convenient source of templates for generating
        specific hybridization probes for the majority of genes. 
        Drosophila embryogenesis has been
        studied extensively, providing a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of
        knowledge for our project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Moreover, studies of a
        large number of individual genes have documented the
        diversity of gene-expression patterns that occur during 
        Drosophila embryogenesis and
        established the importance of tissue-specific gene
        expression for development.
        Here we describe the molecular, microscopic, and
        computational methods we used to produce a database of 
        Drosophila embryonic expression
        patterns that integrates results obtained by 
        in situ hybridization to whole-mount
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> and by expression microarrays. Expression patterns
        are documented by assembling digital photographs of
        individual staged embryos that are ordered to visualize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time-dependent</ENAMEX> changes. To facilitate computational
        analysis, these patterns are annotated using a controlled
        vocabulary that captures developmental and spatial
        relationships between embryonic tissues. We used
        hierarchical clustering of the annotation terms to group
        together genes with similar expression patterns as well as
        tissues with similar sets of expressed genes. We report
        several noteworthy observations based on our initial data,
        which provide a glimpse of the diversity of gene expression
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> that will derive from a complete atlas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns during 
        Drosophila development. All
        production, image and annotation data are stored in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relational</ENAMEX> database and presented in searchable form on the
        web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Overview of the high-throughput in
          situhybridization procedure
          The starting material for the production of
          hybridization probes was the set of cDNA clones that
          comprise the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]. The cDNAs were amplified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well PCR plates
          using a vector-specific primer set that introduces a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> for the production of a digoxigenin-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> by 
          in vitro transcription. PCR
          products were sized to confirm the identity of each clone
          and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction was successful (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The
          strength of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was determined by a dot-blot color
          reaction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). These data were entered into a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relational</ENAMEX> database and later used as experimental
          controls when assessing the outcome of each hybridization
          experiment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> were hybridized to fixed 
          Drosophila embryos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          engrailed, hunchback, brinker )
          with well-described expression patterns were included in
          each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate and used to monitor hybridization
          efficiency. After hybridization, each plate was examined
          to determine the morphology of the embryos, quality of
          the staining and proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> that showed staining
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). A plate containing embryos of acceptable
          morphology, relatively free of staining artifacts and
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells stained</ENAMEX> was considered
          successful and passed on to the image-acquisition
          stage.
          Embryos from successful plates were mounted onto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscope</ENAMEX> slides. Low-magnification digital images of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of embryos were taken (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>) to provide a
          permanent record of the hybridization in each well.
          Low-resolution imaging was insufficient to document
          highly restricted expression patterns or to identify
          small subsets of cells. For that purpose, each slide was
          examined under higher magnification using a Zeiss
          Axiophot optical microscope. At this stage, a human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotator</ENAMEX> carefully examined the entire slide, taking a
          large number of high-resolution digital photographs that
          document that gene's expression pattern (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1e</NUMEX>). All
          images were submitted to the relational database using a
          web-based annotation tool. We determined the success of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiment by taking into account the
          results of the agarose gel analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dot</ENAMEX>-blot analysis of probes, microarray data (described
          below), available information from public databases, and
          the quality of the captured images. Each experiment had
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible outcomes: either the observed expression
          pattern or the absence thereof was consistent with the
          available data, or there was a discrepancy indicating
          failure at some point and that the experiment needs to be
          repeated. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 13%</NUMEX> of the 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">situ</ENAMEX> experiments failed, as a
          result of either the absence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2%</NUMEX>) or a
          poor probe-labeling reaction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4%</NUMEX>), which resulted in no
          detectable staining. Additionally, probes that generated
          expression patterns inconsistent with previously
          published data (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX>) or the microarray expression
          profile (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) were rejected as being possibly mislabeled
          or cross-contaminated. Overall, we obtained useful
          expression data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,179</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,721</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) of the genes
          whose transcript distribution we analyzed.
        
        
          Documenting expression patterns by digital
          photography
          We captured high-resolution photographs of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,388</NUMEX>
          genes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.7%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,179</NUMEX> successfully asssayed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>)
          that exhibited some level of tissue-specific gene
          expression. The captured images were ordered according to
          the developmental stage of the embryos in order to
          visualize the change of the expression pattern over time.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embryogenesis</ENAMEX> is traditionally divided into a series of
          consecutive stages distinguished by morphological markers
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The duration of developmental stages range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes to more than 2 hours</TIMEX>; therefore the stages of
          development were differentially represented in our embryo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collections</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Some consecutive
          stages, although morphologically distinguishable, differ
          very little in terms of changes in gene expression,
          whereas other stage transitions, such as the onset of
          zygotic transcription or organogenesis, are accompanied
          by massive changes in gene expression. We divided the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> stages of embryogenesis into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> convenient
          stage ranges (stages <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3, 4-6, 7-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-10</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-12</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-16</NUMEX>). Each captured image is assigned to a stage range,
          and for each stage range a number of images are taken so
          that all stages within the range are represented. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of images assigned to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage range</ENAMEX> are arranged
          in the web-based annotation tool from left to right so
          that one can follow the pattern through development
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          We took, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> individual images for each
          gene; however, the number of images per gene varies from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 80</TIMEX>. This variability reflects our strategy to
          document highly dynamic, complex, novel and otherwise
          notable patterns extensively, while progressively
          lowering the number of images documenting common or
          simple expression patterns. The number and type of images
          collected for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> were chosen so as to allow an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryologist</ENAMEX> to reconstruct the expression pattern as if
          they were examining the stained embryos under a
          microscope.
          Although the 
          in situ hybridization analysis is
          performed on fixed tissues, the ability to take many
          snapshots of developmental processes and to order them
          allows us to reconstruct dynamic developmental events.
          For example, we can visualize the progressive segmental
          proliferation of the fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>,b,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>,e) or
          follow the dispersal of blood-cell precursors throughout
          the embryo (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3f</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>,h,i,j).
          Many genes are either not expressed at all during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX> or their expression is not tissue specific.
          Several canonical examples of these staining patterns
          were captured, and then only textual annotation and a
          low-magnification image were used to document additional
          occurrences. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">791</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.3%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,179</NUMEX>
          genes successfully assayed) were not documented by
          high-resolution images. These were assigned to one of the
          following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> classes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">362</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.6%</NUMEX>) do not appear to be
          expressed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>) are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maternally</ENAMEX> contributed but are ubiquitously expressed in
          the developing embryo; 317 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.5%</NUMEX>) are exclusively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maternally</ENAMEX> expressed; and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2%</NUMEX>) show both maternal
          and ubiquitous zygotic expression.
        
        
          Microarray data as independent measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          expression patterns
          We used microarray time-course expression profiles as
          independent measurements to ascertain the accuracy of the
          captured expression patterns. For the microarray
          measurements to be truly independent, it was important
          that no single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clone</ENAMEX> contamination or misidentification
          event be able to affect the integrity of both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> and 
          in situ hybridization result.
          Existing microarray datasets, such as that reported in [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], were generated using spotted cDNA arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]
          derived from the same DGC clone set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>] that we
          used for the 
          in situ probes, and were therefore
          unsuitable as independent controls. For this reason, we
          chose to generate a new dataset using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> GeneChip
          technology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], where the oligonucleotide probes are
          designed directly from the genome sequence and do not
          depend on the cDNA clone identity. For the microarray
          analysis, we divided embryogenesis into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 1-hour</TIMEX> time
          windows, collected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent embryo samples for
          each time window, and hybridized total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each
          sample to the GeneChip 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Genome Array</ENAMEX>. As each
          embryo sample contained a distribution of different ages,
          we examined the distribution of morphological
          stage-specific markers in each sample to correlate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-course windows with the nonlinear scale of embryonic
          stages. As described above, the image data are organized
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of images associated with a range of
          embryonic stages. Both the image and the microrray
          datasets are thus linked by a common time scale of
          developmental stages. This facilitates the direct
          comparison of the 
          in situ staining patterns with
          microarray expression indexes. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the
          comparison of array and image data for a highly unusual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression pattern. In the absence of any additional
          information on the cDNA clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LD43816</TIMEX> ( 
          CG4702 ), the contrast between the
          heavy staining seen in late embryos and the earlier
          highly restricted pattern might suggest the possibility
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> contamination. However, when stage-specific
          images are compared with the microarray profile, the
          expression profile is consistent with the 
          in situ hybridization data.
          Although high-throughput 
          in situ hybridization is subject to
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error, such as cross-contamination
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification or probe synthesis, using
          microarray expression data in parallel helped us avoid
          erroneous pattern assignment.
          For a number of reasons, correlating staining patterns
          and microarray values is not straightforward. First, the
          intensity of 
          in situ hybridization staining is
          dependent on the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and length of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> reaction. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is not possible to distinguish
          weak ubiquitous staining from strong staining in a small
          subset of cells using whole-embryo microarray data. For
          microarray data, it is broadly accepted that relative
          comparison of independent measurements for the same gene
          are reliable, whereas absolute intensities across
          different genes are not, especially for low expression
          values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. For all these reasons, the most useful
          factor in correlating microarray and image data is the
          relative fluctuation of signal intensity over the course
          of development. Figure 5shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> examples of distinct
          expression profiles that exhibit strong correlations
          between microarray and image data. The expression
          patterns of all these genes (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG8782</ENAMEX>) have been
          previously described, providing independent confirmation
          that each profile is correct. Clear-cut correlations
          between microarray and 
          in situ hybridization data as seen
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5are</NUMEX> possible when the expression pattern
          exhibits changes over time. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monotonically</ENAMEX> expressed
          genes, the correlation is rather subjective and relies on
          absolute intensities of both microrarray and 
          in situ hybridization signals. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of the experiments, we rejected the observed
          expression pattern because of an obvious mismatch with
          the microarray expression profile; such cases account for
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> of the genes whose analysis will
          need to be repeated.
          Large-scale production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
          in situ data is prone occasionally
          to produce false-negative results due to failures in
          probe production and hybridization. Microarray data are
          useful to identify experiments where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
          in situ hybridization failed but
          the given gene is highly expressed. High absolute
          microarray-derived gene-expression values, coupled with
          either a continuous profile across the time course or
          distinct on/off periods during the time course, is a
          reliable indication that a gene is expressed. Low
          expression values, and a lack of consistency among
          replicate experiments, may indicate that a gene is not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>. However, if a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is active in only a very small subset of cells, the
          microarray results from a whole-animal experiment may not
          be sensitive enough to detect its expression. Therefore,
          even with the microarray data at hand, it is not possible
          to avoid completely false negatives for low-abundance
          transcripts.
        
        
          Textual annotation of gene-expression patterns and
          assembly of a public database
          To provide searching capability beyond queries for a
          specific gene, we rigorously annotated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles using a controlled vocabulary.
          We used human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotation</ENAMEX>, rather than automated
          approaches based on pattern-recognition algorithms,
          because of the overwhelming complexity of annotation.
          Variation in morphology and incomplete knowledge of the
          shape and position of various embryonic structures make
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">computational</ENAMEX> approaches impracticable at present.
          Moreover, a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotator</ENAMEX> does not only take into
          account the image data, but also integrates other
          information such as the microarray profile and previously
          published data into the final assessment of the
          expression pattern. In our project, a single person
          carried out the initial annotation, resulting in a highly
          consistent dataset.
          Annotation of gene-expression patterns that change
          dynamically over time poses a significant challenge.
          There is a need to have a specific name not only for the
          final developed embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> but also for all the
          developmental intermediates that precede them. Every
          terminally differentiated structure of the embryo
          descends from a group of cells within the cellular
          blastoderm epithelium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. We used this embryological
          concept to define a set of embryonic structure names that
          depict a 'path' describing the development of each organ.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> basic categories of developmental structures, called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anlage</ENAMEX> in statu nascendi, anlage, primordium and organ,
          are distinguished.
          At the end of embryogenesis, organs can be
          distinguished by their unique morphology and function
          (for examples, see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). Traditionally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types
          of developmental intermediates that precede the
          terminally differentiated organ have been defined: anlage
          and primordium (for examples, see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). An anlage
          is defined as a morphologically indistinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          contiguous cells, established by lineage tracing, that
          gives rise to an individual organ. Anlagen for most
          organs can be distinguished at the late cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastoderm</ENAMEX> or gastrula stage (stages <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-9</ENAMEX>). A primordium
          can be recognized on the basis of its distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>. A primordium will give rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          differentiated organs. We have included the germ layers
          in the primordium category. Primordia develop from
          anlagen but an anlage - for example, a group of cells
          defined by gene expression that will give rise to a
          subset of an organ - can also be part of a primordium.
          Individual names are connected by relationships that
          define the way the respective tissues develop from one
          another or encompass one another.
          Many genes whose expression is ultimately restricted
          to, and required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of, a specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anlage</ENAMEX> initially appear in a larger area. This dynamic
          expression may reflect the working of an underlying
          molecular network of activating and inhibitory factors
          which only gradually succeed in directing expression of a
          given gene to a specific subset of cells which thereby
          become defined as a distinct anlage. We propose the term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'anlage</ENAMEX> in statu <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nascendi</ENAMEX>' ( 
          in statu nascendi can be loosely
          translated as 'in the process of being formed') for the
          larger domain from which a specific anlage originates.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anlagen</ENAMEX> in statu nascendi can only be visualized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression analysis. They typically appear at the
          cellular blastoderm stage and resolve into specific
          anlagen towards the beginning of gastrulation (examples
          are given in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>).
          Using this naming scheme we are able to describe the
          development of embryonic structures starting from anlage
          in statu nascendi at the cellular blastoderm stage
          through a series of developmental intermediates - anlage
          and primordia - to a differentiated embryonic structure.
          For example, the transcription factor single minded is
          expressed in the glial cells of the mature embryo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          The origin of this expression pattern can be traced from
          the mesectoderm anlage in statu nascendi, to the
          mesectoderm anlage, to the mesectoderm (or midline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primordium</ENAMEX>) and, finally, to the mature midline glial
          cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>).
          In the annotation tool (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), only those
          annotation terms that describe structures present within
          a specific stage range are displayed beneath the images
          of embryos from that stage. Annotation terms are
          organized into a hierarchy according to the developmental
          relationship between them. Using the annotation tool, one
          can follow and describe the development of each structure
          through its intermediates by observing the development of
          the staining pattern and selecting the appropriate
          annotation terms. Integration of image data with the
          predefined developmental hierarchy is one of the prime
          goals of our annotation effort.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of storing the data in a database is the
          ability to query the data and compare results in a
          rigorous manner. However, this is only possible if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that are entered into the database are themselves
          rigorously controlled. Comparisons of biological data are
          complicated by the lack of standards in both reagents and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX>. We provide a standardized set of 
          in situ expression images prepared
          using the same hybridization probes, laboratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX>, and descriptive nomenclature. For the
          nomenclature we needed an agreed vocabulary of terms to
          describe the different anatomical features of the 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> and the different
          stages of embryonic development. This was provided to us
          by the controlled vocabularies of anatomy and development
          that have been constructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] over the past
          few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. A further advantage in using these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabularies</ENAMEX> is that our data will be recorded in a way
          that is wholly consistent with that used by the FlyBase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curators</ENAMEX>, who record gene-expression data from the
          scientific literature.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> controlled vocabularies are organized as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> acyclic graph (DAG). In a DAG the terms are the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX> in the graph and the relationships between terms
          are the arcs of the graph. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> characteristics
          that make it extremely useful for describing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabularies</ENAMEX>. First, the graph is directed, which means
          that the reciprocal roles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> terms in a relationship
          are unequal. Thus, the 'parent' term may be a less
          specific and the 'child' term more detailed. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
          unlike strict hierarchies, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> term may have more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parent terms. This data structure is the same as
          that used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> for terms
          that are used to annotate gene products [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> controlled vocabulary uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes
          of relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> terms. The first
          of this is 'is an instance of'; for example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spiracle</ENAMEX>' is an instance of its parent term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'spiracle'</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is 'part of; for example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'gastric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caecum</ENAMEX>' is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'foregut'</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is
          'develops from'; for example, a 'glial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>' develops
          from a 'glioblast'.
          The major change that had to be made to the FlyBase
          controlled vocabulary to support this project was to name
          the developmental intermediates that arise during
          embryogenesis, that is anlagen, primordia, and anlagen in
          statu nascendi. Our annotation uses a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> or so
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,800</NUMEX> terms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FlyBase</ENAMEX> controlled vocabulary,
          many of which only apply to later stages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
          We modified the GO database schema [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storage</ENAMEX> and searching of our gene-expression data. For
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the terms and their relationships, the
          core of the GO database schema remains essentially
          unchanged. However, the database was extended to support
          the annotation process itself; that is, assigning terms
          to describe the expression patterns. Additional tables
          were also added to describe when and where a given mRNA
          is expressed, and the images that constitute the evidence
          for these observations.
          We implemented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> publicly available tools to search
          and mine the gene-expression dataset. The advanced search
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> is a modified version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gadfly</ENAMEX> search interface
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. It can be utilized to search for the
          expression pattern of an individual gene of interest,
          retrieve a list of genes expressed in a given embryonic
          structure, or set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, or all genes expressed
          at a certain stage of embryonic development. Sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their corresponding expression profiles can be
          grouped on the basis of cytological position in the
          genome, functional GO assignments, or the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> in the gene sequence. The results
          returned by all types of searches can be formatted to
          display controlled vocabulary annotations exclusively or
          also show images and microarray profiles of sets of genes
          side by side (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Alternatively, one can explore
          the dataset by browsing through the controlled vocabulary
          using a modified version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amigo Gene Ontology</ENAMEX>
          browser, which we call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ImaGO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Once a term from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> is selected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImaGO</ENAMEX> will return a page that
          lists all genes expressed in a given structure and also
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that descend from
          it.
        
        
          Systematic analysis of the in situdata
          The embryonic expression patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,388</NUMEX>
          genes that display restricted expression, and were
          therefore annotated in our database, are described by a
          unique set of annotation terms. This observation
          illustrates the tremendous diversity of gene-expression
          patterns during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>, which range from
          expression in a single embryonic structure to expression
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> distinct tissues. Although expression patterns of
          genes are rarely identical, there is a noticeable
          similarity among patterns of expression of many genes.
          Therefore we sought to order these genes on the basis of
          the similarity of their expression patterns. Furthermore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data can be used to quantify the
          relatedness of the various embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in terms
          of similarity in gene expression between them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. We
          carried out hierarchical clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and tissues
          using a method based on binary similarity metrics ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>];
          for details see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8shows</NUMEX> the
          result of clustering the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> differentiated embryonic
          structures that expressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,388</NUMEX>
          genes. A black dash at the intersection of a row and a
          column of the matrix occurs whenever the gene
          corresponding to that row is expressed in the embryonic
          structure corresponding to that column.
          The clustering organizes the embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in
          such a way that related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are close together
          whereas unrelated ones are widely separated. For example,
          components of the nervous system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shading</ENAMEX>) that are ectoderm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>, cluster together
          and away from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesodermal</ENAMEX> derivatives, such as muscles
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, cyan shading). In other words, very few of the
          genes in our dataset are expressed in both muscles and
          the nervous system, reflecting the physiological
          separation and different developmental origins of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tissues.
          By analogy, the genes are organized by the
          hierarchical clustering so that those with the most
          similar expression patterns are close together and those
          with highly divergent patterns are widely separated. The
          distribution of clusters in the matrix can be used to
          identify genes that are expressed in a tissue or set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. For example, the red rectangle in Figure
          8highlights a cluster of genes that are expressed
          exclusively in the embryonic fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Genes expressed in
          the tracheal system are split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> clusters;
          genes expressed exclusively in the trachea form a cluster
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the matrix</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, blue rectangle),
          and a second cluster includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trachea</ENAMEX> and variety of epidermal structures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>,
          magenta rectangle). Interestingly, no genes are expressed
          in both trachea and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> (note the gap in CNS clusters
          at the level of the tracheal cluster). Genes expressed in
          the nervous system form the most prominent clusters. The
          annotation vocabulary subdivides the nervous system into
          specific subsets based on tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> (neurons, glia)
          and anatomical position (brain, ventral nerve cord,
          lateral cord, sensory nervous system). A cluster of genes
          that are expressed specifically in the components of the
          peripheral nervous system and absent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> can be
          identified (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, yellow rectangle). An increase in
          the depth of annotation will be required to subdivide the
          large clusters that correspond to complex organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 8represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible outcome of the
          clustering analysis of the annotation dataset. Filtering
          of the genes and anatomical structures, the type of
          clustering algorithm and the distance metric are
          variables that need to be optimized to address specific
          questions about the variations in patterns of gene
          expression. We used a relatively simple metric to define
          similarity among the annotation data. In the future it
          will be interesting to explore more complex similarity
          metrics that incorporate the distance between annotation
          terms within the ontology. Clustering of the annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and other data-mining approaches will establish sets
          of co-regulated genes that will provide a starting point
          for investigating 
          cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> that may
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elucidate</ENAMEX> novel regulatory relationships in development.
          Interactive web pages with a complete clustering matrix
          can be accessed at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Systematic RNA</ENAMEX> 
          in situ hybridization is an
          alternative to mutagenesis screens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] to uncover genes
          involved in embryonic patterning. Figure
          9a,b,c,dillustrates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case where conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> failed to identify genes with highly specific
          expression patterns at the cellular blastoderm stage,
          most probably because of genetic redundancy. At map
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66E4</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> adjacent and highly homologous genes
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brachyury/T-box-containing</ENAMEX> transcription factors are
          expressed with strikingly similar expression patterns.
          Thus disruption of any one of these genes might not be
          sufficient to produce an embryonic phenotype. Conversely,
          in many cases the expression patterns of duplicated genes
          have diverged and are largely non-overlapping. Expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can provide a guide as to which multiple gene
          knockouts are likely to yield specific phenotypes.
          A systematic screening approach also reduces bias in
          the selection of the types of genes chosen for study.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9e,9f,9g,9h,9ishows five</NUMEX> examples of metabolic
          genes that, contrary to naive expectation, are expressed
          at cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blastoderm</ENAMEX> in domains suggestive of roles in
          embryonic patterning. A similar observation was recently
          reported for the expression of genes isolated
          specifically from blastoderm-specific cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. Tight regulation of expression of these genes could
          be explained by a preferential requirement for certain
          metabolic pathways in specialized embryonic tissues. That
          argument may not be plausible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed within
          limited regions of the cellular blastoderm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>. It is
          possible that these gene products are not translated, are
          otherwise inactive in the tissues where the transcripts
          appear abundant, or that their restricted expression is
          simply the result of their proximity to a transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> element of a neighboring gene. A more interesting
          possibility is that this expression may reflect yet
          unknown functions of these genes.
          A major advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> 
          in situ hybridization is that this
          method has sufficient spatial resolution to uncover
          subcellular localization of mRNAs. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9j</TIMEX>,lshows an
          apically localized mRNA in the columnar epithelium of the
          developing hindgut surrounding the migrating pole cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9l</NUMEX>). This staining is strikingly complementary to
          that of a basally localized mRNA from a different gene
          that is expressed in the same cells (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9k</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>). The
          transcript of yet another gene, whose expression is shown
          at high magnification at the pre-cellular blastoderm
          stage, appears to be localized to a sub-compartment of
          the nucleus (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9n</TIMEX>,o). We also found novel mRNAs
          localized asymmetrically along the anterior-posterior
          axis of the early pre-blastoderm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Overall, we find that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of genes exhibit easily
          discernible subcellular localization, and thus our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> can also be useful in identifying aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and trafficking.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The dataset we present here comprises embryonic
        expression patterns for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-sixth</NUMEX> of all 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, documented with
        extensive digital images, controlled vocabulary annotations
        and microarray profiles. Our ultimate goal is to determine
        the expression patterns of all genes in the genome.
        Considering our current production rate, we should be able
        to finish the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass through the existing cDNA
        collections that represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> of all 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX>. We
        will then repeat our analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> or so of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
        which we did not obtain reliable data. Probes for genes
        that lack a suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cDNA clone</ENAMEX>, but that show significant
        expression by microarray analysis, will be generated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic PCR</ENAMEX> so that eventually all 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be examined. We
        also intend to extend our analysis to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
        developmentally active 
        Drosophila tissues - imaginal discs
        and ovaries.
        All our data are freely available to the scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> through interactive web pages; these pages will
        continue to develop and will allow for more sophisticated
        mining of the growing dataset. Similar large-scale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression studies have been carried out in other
        model organisms including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], medaka [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>] and 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Our
        database is, to our knowledge, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-redundant</ENAMEX> expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) collections with
        the aim of determining and systematically annotating the
        expression patterns of all genes in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. We intend
        to link our database to the available public databases
        containing similar image data in order to allow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-species comparisons of expression of homologous
        genes. The ultimate goal is to create an integrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> of image oriented gene-expression data analogous
        to the public repositories of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well in situhybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> were collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-h</TIMEX> intervals and
          aged to generate animals <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-3, 3-6, 6-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-12</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-15</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-18 h old</TIMEX>. The embryos were then dechorionated,
          devitelinized, and stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20C</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-h embryo collections were mixed in equal proportions to
          yield a balanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> representing the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 h</NUMEX> of embryogenesis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX> were generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using primers
          homologous to the vector and purified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G50</TIMEX> column
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format. The purified PCR
          product (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 l</ENAMEX>) was transcribed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format by
          incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h at 37C</TIMEX> after the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 l</NUMEX> of
          a polymerase reaction cocktail consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U RNase</ENAMEX> inhibitor, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> mM

          After treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I and Na</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 pH 10.2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX> was
          carried out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellets</ENAMEX> were resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          formamide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX>
          Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>.
          The digoxigenin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> probe was quantified by
          immunological detection using a modified digoxigenin
          quantification protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>). A sample of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.8 l</NUMEX> of a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:300</TIMEX> dilution of the probe was spotted on a positively
          charged nylon membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>) with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well pin tool
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V&P Scientific</ENAMEX>) and then cross-linked to the
          membrane by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> irradiation. The membranes were then
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-digoxigenin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fab</ENAMEX> fragments and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> substrates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBT/BCIP</ENAMEX>. The quality of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was
          determined by comparing the intensity of individual probe
          spots to spots containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,10</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,100</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 pg</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> probes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-hydrated and post-fixed embryos were incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> in hybridization buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microliters</ENAMEX> of these embryos were
          gently placed in each well of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well filter plate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore MADV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N65</ENAMEX>) with a multi-channel pipette (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brand</ENAMEX>

          pre-sterilized tips (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rainin</ENAMEX>). Digoxigenin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          probe (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 l</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:100</ENAMEX> dilution in hybridization buffer
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> dextran sulfate) was added and the embryos were
          incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55C</TIMEX>. Gentle vacuum was used to
          remove the hybridization solution and the embryos were
          subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight 30-min washes</NUMEX> in wash buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          formamide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). The embryos were
          treated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> goat serum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>) and
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">digoxigenin</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fab</ENAMEX> fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>). Following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-min washes</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> Tween 20 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rinses in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBT/BCIP</ENAMEX> color substrates were used
          to detect the hybridized probes. Embryos were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          times with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> to enhance contrast and stored in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycerol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. The quality of the hybridization signal,
          the morphology of the embryos and the number of patterns
          were assessed under a low-power microscope.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> imaging
          Low-magnification images were taken using a dissecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microscope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leica Wild M10</ENAMEX>) equipped with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ProgRes 3012</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> camera. Usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> images at different
          magnifications were captured. High-resolution images were
          captured with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spot RT</ENAMEX> digital camera mounted onto a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Axiophot</ENAMEX> equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomarski</ENAMEX> optics. The
          majority of images were taken with either a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          objective. All images were saved as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPEG</ENAMEX> files.
          Often several focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> were
          captured to fully document the spatial distribution of
          the staining pattern. In many cases embryos were manually
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repositioned</ENAMEX> to provide a more favorable angle for
          documenting the expression pattern. When a whole embryo
          view was insufficient to visualize the fine aspects of
          the staining pattern, we captured a higher-magnification
          image focused on a small part of the embryo. Such
          higher-resolution images were generally accompanied by
          corresponding lower-magnification images for orientation
          purposes. Most images show the embryo with anterior to
          the left and dorsal side up; however, the orientation of
          images captured in the early stages of the project do not
          consistently follow this rule.
        
        
          Microarray analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton S</ENAMEX> flies were seeded into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> cages
          and aged in the collection cages for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> with
          fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> provided every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> day, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> were allowed to pre-lay retained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX>. Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plates</ENAMEX> were then introduced simultaneously
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 12</NUMEX> cages and embryos were collected for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h.</TIMEX> The
          embryos were then transferred into a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25C</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> and
          aged. At appropriate time points, embryos were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dechorionated</ENAMEX> and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This
          procedure yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> samples of non-overlapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-h
          collections starting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 to 90</TIMEX> min and ending at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> h post egg laying. This procedure was carried
          out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>, yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replicates of each time
          window. A sampling of each collection was set aside,
          devitelinized, and stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20C</TIMEX>. These
          embryos were used to determine the distribution of stages
          in each collection sample by examination of morphological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. These data were then used to construct an
          approximate time line correlating the embryo collections
          and embryonic stages (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> embryo samples
          described above by homogenization with a motorized
          plastic pellet pestle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ambion RNAwiz</ENAMEX> solution, followed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX>
          micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were used to generate
          digoxigenin-labeled fragmented cRNA using a standard
          Affymetrix amplification and labeling protocol. cRNA was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to a GeneChip 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Array</ENAMEX> using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard Affymetrix</ENAMEX> equipment and protocols. The scanned
          array images were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> Microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suite</ENAMEX> and dChip software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. We collected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36</NUMEX> GeneChip
          array scans and the success of the experiments was
          determined by the reproducibility of the three
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> experiments were
          repeated to gain higher-quality data. Microarray data are
          being submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Array Express</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-RUBN-2</ENAMEX>.
          Signals from all replicate experiments were averaged
          and the standard error of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measurements was
          calculated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were entered into a custom-designed
          MySQL database and graphs of the microarray time-course
          for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were generated using custom Perl
          scripts and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GD</ENAMEX> graphics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. The absent/present
          calls generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">color-coded</ENAMEX> (present = green, absent = red, marginal =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX>) and incorporated into graphs based on dChip-derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The array-based expression profiles were
          incorporated into the annotation, report, and analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">web pages</ENAMEX> described below.
        
        
          Image data annotation and presentation
          We built a multi-platform network consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Windows</ENAMEX> workstations connected to digital
          cameras on microscope equipment and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suse Linux</ENAMEX> server
          running an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apache HTTP server</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX> database. Image
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and annotations were submitted to the production
          MySQL database through a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perl</ENAMEX>-based annotation tool
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The annotation tool displays microarray data
          linked to the cDNA under investigation as well as a
          compilation of available information about that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in
          the form of external database links, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> and
          GO terms (from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FlyBase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]). The annotation tool
          permits the entering of production-level assessments
          about the quality and identity of the captured images.
          Several other web-based tools were developed that support
          the entering of additional data (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1a,1b,1c,1d</NUMEX>) as
          well as report scripts that summarize the captured
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
          Periodically, the data from the production database
          were transferred into a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">MySQL</ENAMEX> database that uses a
          schema modified from that of the GO database. In
          conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gadfly</ENAMEX> database and Application
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programming Interface</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]), this database allows
          gene-based and anatomy-based searches of the dataset [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>].
          The controlled vocabulary used to annotate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles is a subset of the FlyBase
          controlled vocabulary for anatomy and development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
          Most annotation terms can be found under the 'developing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">embryonic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of this ontology. We
          developed a modified version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amigo Gene Ontology</ENAMEX>
          Browser, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ImaGO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], which incorporates the anatomy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ontologies</ENAMEX> and the image data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImaGO</ENAMEX> can be used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browse</ENAMEX> through and search the data by anatomical
          structures. A more concise version of the annotation
          hierarchy containing only the terms found in the
          annotation tool can be accessed at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Clustering of annotation data
          Annotation data were converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">binary matrix</ENAMEX>,
          the rows representing the genes and the columns
          representing the anatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. When a given gene
          was expressed in a given anatomical structure the
          intersection in the matrix was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; otherwise it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> was loaded into an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> statistics package and
          dissimilarity matrices were calculated for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows
          and each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> columns of the dataset. The distance measure
          was (b + c)/(a + b + c), where a is the frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          columns in two rows of binary data, b is the frequency of
          10 columns and c is the frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> columns. Using
          the dissimilarity matrices, anatomical structures and
          genes were clustered sequentially using hierarchical
          clustering with a complete linkage agglomeration method.
          Clustered matrices were exported from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and converted
          into interactive web pages using a custom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> script.
          The binary data were color-coded; black indicates that
          the gene is on in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, white indicates that
          expression of the gene is not detected in that
          structure.
