        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridging</ENAMEX>, or jumping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (BPCR) can convert DNA
        backbone interruptions anywhere in the region of shared
        sequence between primer binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> into a single and
        unique amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The logic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In principle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> can detect
        backbone interruptions anywhere within a chosen sequence
        region. This manuscript reports a study in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> is
        used to detect a minority of interrupted molecules in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> operon of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and describes a
        system to measure noise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> and noise in bridging PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridging PCR</ENAMEX> (BPCR) is a combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes,
          a recombination between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> template sequences and an
          amplification of the recombinant template. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> parental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> share a homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (a region in which
          the sequence is identical) and diverge in the
          nonhomologous flanking sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> side of the
          nonhomologous flanking sequence of each of the two
          "parental" molecules contains a different PCR
          primer-binding site. Neither parental template has both
          primer-binding sites. Therefore a "chain reaction" cannot
          occur and only linear amplification is expected.
          However, during the course of cycling, recombination
          can occur between the homologous regions via a copy
          choice mechanism (illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> template sequence, if it is within the homologous
          region, can anneal to the other template. During the next
          extension cycle the invading strand will grow from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end, and newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> will cross the region of
          sequence similarity and continue into sequences unique to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> template, including the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">template</ENAMEX>'s
          primer binding site. The result is a recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, identical to the product of 
          in vivo homologous recombination,
          with one flank from the original strand and the other
          flank from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> template. Because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primer
          sites are now 
          in cis , the recombinant sequence
          can be amplified exponentially.
          If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of either template is not within the
          region of similar sequence, then no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end will hybridize
          to the other template and synthesis does not lead to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>. The creation of recombinant sequences
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reflects the presence of templates whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          ends are within the region of sequence similarity. BPCR
          ought to be utilizable to assay the proportion of input
          templates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' ends in the region of sequence
          similarity. However, the reaction itself can produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          ends which then lead to recombinant templates. For
          maximum sensitivity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> ratio, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction
          itself should not produce ends at any sites that did not
          exist in the input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> itself generates new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3'ends</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> new ends yield recombinant products, even
          if the initial template was completely intact.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid pBS</ENAMEX> and Phagescript
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the map and sequence of templates and
          primer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> between a portion of plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phagescript</ENAMEX>, a derivative of the ssDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M13</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phage</ENAMEX>.
          This pair of substrates meets the requirement for BPCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> because the region of shared sequence, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> operon, are flanked by
          sequences that are different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors. The
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> operon is one of the most
          frequently used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the study of 
          in vivo mutagenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Determination of signal to noise (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> samples with known quantities of templates were
          prepared: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sample contained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) sequence
          template with a cut in the homologous region created by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> digestion (cut template) and
          the intact ssDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phagescript DNA (</ENAMEX>reference template). In
          the other sample both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) (intact template) and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phagescript DNA (</ENAMEX>reference template) were intact. The
          molar ratio of reference template (ssDNA) to either
          intact template (dsDNA) or to cut template (dsDNA,
          considering only one of the two fragments) was about
          10.
          The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) sequence template, either
          cut or intact, was adjusted to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.1 nM</NUMEX> and to be
          equal in the two samples. The equality was confirmed by a
          20 thermal cycle conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with primers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b1</ENAMEX> and M13
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revI</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> outputs from serial dilutions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold
          dilution between each step) were similar between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was serially diluted into BPCR
          reactions, the dilution involving only the cut and intact
          template, with everything else unchanged. The highest
          concentration of template was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">14molecules/Î¼l</ENAMEX>.
          Typically, dilution steps were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold each and covered a
          million fold range. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were run in parallel (same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, same volume and running on the same
          thermal block at the same time). After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX>, output
          of recombinant DNA was assayed by electrophoresis. For
          each dilution one can obtain the concentration of output
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>] as a function of [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ts</ENAMEX>], the concentration of template
          (cut or intact depending on the sample). For each sample
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> defines [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ts</ENAMEX>] 
          off as a cut-off concentration below
          which [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>] is no longer saturated. The signal to noise is
          the ratio between [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ts</ENAMEX>] 
          off in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>:
          
          For example, if the cut-off concentration of the cut
          sample is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times less than the intact cut-off
          concentration then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Pre-annealing and pre-extension
          A pre-annealing and pre-extension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> improved the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N.</ENAMEX> In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, templates in the reaction tube with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã PCR buffer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dNTP</ENAMEX>'s were heated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90Â°C</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> then gradually cooled (by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1Â°C/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pre-extension</ENAMEX> was carried out by holding the
          temperature at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> and adding polymerase to the
          pre-annealing tube. The temperature was held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three more minutes</TIMEX> before it was dropped to room
          temperature. The rationale for pre-extension [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] was
          that cut template molecules that are annealed to
          reference molecules should be extended by the polymerase
          to become full length. There are no primers present in
          the pre-extension cycle and therefore this cycle does not
          generate the class of noise due to incomplete extension
          from normal primers.
          Immediately following pre-extension, i.e. without
          storage at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, the samples were serially diluted and PCR
          amplified with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> primers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase yielded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N of</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
          Templates were prepared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer b1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jp</ENAMEX> on
          template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid pBS</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>). Phagescript phage particles,
          rather than purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> prepared from the particles by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">phenol</ENAMEX> extraction, were used as the reference template [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">b1 and M13</TIMEX> pI (see figure
          2for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">primer</ENAMEX> locations) which would give a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1261</TIMEX> bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recombination</ENAMEX> product. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> with Taq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10</TIMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>). This result is consistent with the report that Taq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>'s nuclease activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 11</ENAMEX> ] cuts in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> cut site is within the
          homologous region in this system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> was conducted for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase.
          Several variations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase were
          carried out (data not shown), including: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) cut and
          intact templates were prepared with primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">b1 and b2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          purified ssDNA instead of phage particles was used as a
          reference template and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) cut and intact templates were
          prepared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> in these variations. Increase in the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> and/or a longer extension time (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>) were also tested and found to be not acceptable
          because non-specific output, in the form of multiple gel
          bands or smearing gel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, frequently appeared.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Combining Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase with a small quantity of Pfu
          polymerase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] had little effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Additives</ENAMEX> that improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq polymerase S/N</ENAMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX>
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> were found to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> ratio.
          Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> tested, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gp32 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 SO</TIMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4</TIMEX> improved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> most efficiently
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> reached <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (See figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Compare cut vs
          intact rows in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-10</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-15</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Combining gp32</ENAMEX> and

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase gave a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase is a truncated
          portion of the enzyme which retains polymerase activity
          but lacks the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">5'->3</ENAMEX>' exonuclease activity of Taq
          polymerase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment does not cut at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lac operator</ENAMEX> as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . It might
          therefore be a good choice of polymerase for jumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
          Consistent with the expectation, results of using the
          Stoffel fragment, without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp32</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 SO</TIMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>, gave a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8,9,10</NUMEX>). Addition of any of the above <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> did not
          further improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> templates used were
          also prepared by standard PCR with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment
          and the primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">b1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jp on pBS</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> primers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M13</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pV</ENAMEX>, produced the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328</NUMEX>
          bp recombinant sequence. In this size range the Stoffel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fragment of Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase yielded a better S/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> than Taq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment had low output
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between primers b1 and M13</TIMEX> pI. This is consistent
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s description that the Stoffel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> is not optimal for the amplification of
          sequences <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 1 kb.</TIMEX>
          Vent polymerase lacking nuclease activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] is
          also expected to give a low noise level. However, it
          yielded insufficient output (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> of noise in BPCR

          Taq polymerase harbors nuclease activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
          Sites of stem-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are particularly vulnerable
          to both degradation and to polymerase stalling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX>
          ] both of which generate noise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX>. Gp32, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment had a
          low KCl concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX>). Since the stem-loop
          structure of the template is less likely to form at low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, this low concentration could also contribute to the
          increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N.</ENAMEX> Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> polymerase
          both reached the same optimum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, it seems most
          likely that template damage via heating-cooling cycles as
          found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustafson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] is limiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> in this
          system.
        
        
          Applications and limitations of bridging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> as an
          assay for DNA damage
          It is a basic aspect of materials science in any
          system to study discontinuities. This is especially the
          case in materials that store information. Several methods
          are available to assay discontinuities in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and for
          many applications, one of the several current methods may
          suffice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . DNA backbone
          interruptions are key intermediates in genetic metabolism
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemotherapy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , ionizing radiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] and
          dietary mutagens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] also cause distributed DNA strand
          interruptions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . Chemical modifications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50</NUMEX>
          ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] need not break the DNA backbone to impede the
          progress of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. Other modifications can be
          converted into backbone interruptions. For example, it
          has been proposed that alkali-sensitive ribonucleotides
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are a source of mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          It is likely that the presently attained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> is barely adequate for 
          in vivo studies. Further
          improvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> by another factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 or 100</NUMEX>
          would give greater assurance. Even with the achieved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, we are faced with a dilemma because of the lack
          of other techniques that can detect a defect in less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> over a long region, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">328 bp</NUMEX> in this
          study. Background breaks at any site in the region
          contribute to noise, therefore the background breakage at
          any given site is apparently <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Break-copy recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] almost inevitably
        occurs during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>; it has been called variously: bridging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, jumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, recombinogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> sewing, gene
        shuffling, and sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. Sometimes this process is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'bug'</ENAMEX> in the system leading to artifacts; sometimes it is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'feature</ENAMEX>' leading to diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of products.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridging PCR</ENAMEX> is to a certain extent- ca <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>/kb- found in
        this work, unavoidable in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. With a proper configuration
        of markers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> can be used as a sensitive method for
        detecting discontinuities in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In another context,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> of bridging synthesis is important for computing
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. For assay and computing applications it is
        necessary to consider noise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX>. In this work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCR</ENAMEX> was
        studied over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 328</TIMEX> base segment of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lac</ENAMEX> operon, and the noise level was
        measured as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> when no special precautions
        were taken with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase. With buffer modifications
        or the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4 gp32</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N of Taq</ENAMEX> was improved to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment yielded a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> without
        modifications of the standard protocol but was not further
        improved by buffer modifications or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp32</TIMEX>. In this system
        with normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase, the level of bridging
        that occured was ca <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> per kilobase of amplifed sequence.
        It must be cautioned that our results have been obtained in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> system with respect to the test sequence and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>. Differences of the sequence and of reaction
        conditions are expected to alter the proportion of bridging
        that occurs in any particular system. With respect to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, it is anticipated that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of potential
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or other sites that are targets for the
        nuclease activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> may become hotspots for "crossing
        over" during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of materials used in this study: Phagescript
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) plasmid were from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene; Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoffel</ENAMEX> fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> were from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin Elmer Cetus</ENAMEX>;
        gp32 was from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E II-digested Lambda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pvu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">digestion</ENAMEX> was carried out
        according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s directions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolabs</ENAMEX>), and completeness was assayed by gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>. Single stranded phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared
        from phage particle suspension with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">phenol</ENAMEX> extraction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
        ] . Phenol was tris-equilibrated at pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridging PCR</ENAMEX> reaction solution contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dNTP</ENAMEX>'s, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 SO</TIMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM was used in some reactions
        (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) as was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>. When used (see

        The PCR thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> were as follows: An initial 3
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>, each cycle
        consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was "hot start", i.e., the polymerase mixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        of the final reaction volume in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã buffer was added to the
        rest of the mix during the initial denaturing step when the
        sample temperature was already at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX>. Hot start and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycling</ENAMEX> was carried out on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkin Elmer Gene Amp</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9600</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining
        and fluorescence after electrophoresis through <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> agarose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX>.
