        An extensive collection of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhimurium</ENAMEX> auxotrophic
        mutants, accumulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miloslav Demerec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950 and 1960 decades</TIMEX> was used primarily to develop
        intra- and inter-genic maps of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LT2</ENAMEX> chromosome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        . Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> of these original sealed agar stab cultures
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/agar stab vial), together with the original
        stockbooks, are now curated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Research Center</ENAMEX>.
        The isolates were all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of a common parental
        strain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] that was lyophilized around the same time that
        the original stab cultures were banked. The original
        mutants were very stable as indicated by low rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversion</ENAMEX> to prototrophy.
        In previous reports, we noted extensive diversity among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the parental strain, including diversity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RpoS</ENAMEX> and catalase synthesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and diversity in genome
        size, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content, and reversion from auxotrophy to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prototrophy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Funchain, 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] reported that Biolog
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phenotype Microarrayâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>) plates test for loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">350-400</ENAMEX>
        gene functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES Biolog</ENAMEX> plates that they used were
        designed to distinguish 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salmonella sp</ENAMEX>. Since their report,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phenotype Microarrayâ„¢ PM1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> plates became
        available specifically for catabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and
        nitrogen substrates, respectively. Use of these plates
        extends potential scoring of loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">non-essential genes</ENAMEX> to
        perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-20%</NUMEX> of the entire genome.
        To increase our knowledge of diversity among these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">archival strains</ENAMEX>, we scored for metabolic changes using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biolog Phenotype Microarrayâ„</ENAMEX>¢ plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM1 and PM3</TIMEX>)
        followed by plating on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacConkey</ENAMEX> agar base supplemented
        with a variety of sugars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM</ENAMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> provided
        a standardized microtiter method using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> biochemical tests
        for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three 96</NUMEX>-well plates to characterize and/or
        identify different metabolic profiles among microorganisms.
        Initially, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">archival strains</ENAMEX> were tested on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> plates,
        the only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Biologâ„</ENAMEX>¢ plates available at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> (data not
        shown). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> plates became available, we
        selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> strains that previously showed diversity from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> tests for further testing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the MacConkey
        plates verified the changes in carbohydrate metabolism
        observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biologâ„¢</ENAMEX> system.
      
      
        Results
        As noted, experiments were started with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> plates
        designed as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salmonella sp</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM1</ENAMEX> and PM3
        plates became available, we chose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> archival strains from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> list to score for differences in catabolism of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>
        different substrates with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Biologâ„¢ PM1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
        additional non-archival strains were tested including the
        sequenced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> (our strain <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2004</NUMEX>) for
        comparison. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1contains</ENAMEX> information on the background
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used for this study as well as other strains
        used for comparison and as controls. Table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1also</TIMEX> lists the
        number of differences between the sequenced reference
        strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2004</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">archival strains</ENAMEX>. Thus, out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and nitrogen substrates, archival strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1601</TIMEX>
        differed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>) of the tests. On the other
        hand, strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1687</TIMEX>, stored for approximately the same length
        of time, differed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 13</NUMEX> substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilizations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 7%</NUMEX>).
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel B of Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> non-archival <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
        included. Note that Pasteurella 
        multocida differed from strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>
        in substrate utilization for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>, an indicator
        of the validity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biologâ„¢</ENAMEX> system. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-archival
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium strains also displayed
        some differences from the sequenced strain, an indication
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Biologâ„¢ PM1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> system might be useful in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiology</ENAMEX> and evolutionary studies.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> [see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] lists the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> carbon

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, and the number of archival strains (out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>) that
        also catabolized these substrates. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-galacturonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was most easily dispensable (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/21</NUMEX>), followed closely

        also catabolized these substrates. Thus, hydroxylamine and
        D,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-alpha-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-caprylic acid</ENAMEX> were the most easily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispensable</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/21</NUMEX> for each), followed closely by
        D-amino-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-valeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/21</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-amino-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-valeric acid

        Table 5lists <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11</TIMEX> nitrogen substrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> plate) that
        were not metabolized by the sequenced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> strain. However,
        several archival strains did catabolize these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        substrates, perhaps indicating alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCUSSION</ENAMEX>, below).
        It is of interest that there are amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon PM1</ENAMEX> and the nitrogen PM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plates</ENAMEX>. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidation</ENAMEX> reaction for serine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM1</TIMEX> identified carbon
        catabolism, while the ammonia moiety of serine was one
        enzyme, into a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> that can feed all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon pathways</ENAMEX>. Sometimes, but not always, the enzymes are
        the same, but induction of the enzymes under <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> or
        nitrogen starvation may be different [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bochner</ENAMEX>,
        personal communication].
      
      
        Discussion
        Bochner, 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] emphasize that the PM
        plates may be used to analyze the linkage between genotype
        and phenotype. They point out that scoring of catabolic
        loss is identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PM3</TIMEX> tests. Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> can be
        used as nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> since in many cases they only need
        a single enzyme such as a transaminase or deaminase to
        liberate the ammonia. Some amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> can also be used as
        a carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> when their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon skeletons</ENAMEX> are converted,
        usually by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> substrate, and can reveal the loss
        of shared transport functions or shared catabolic enzymes.
        The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plates</ENAMEX> have several major benefits to the
        analysis of our strains: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) color change is easy to monitor
        and quantitate; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) color change is very sensitive and
        highly reproducible; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">respiration</ENAMEX> can occur
        independent of cell growth and, in some cases, can measure
        phenotypes that do not lead to growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biologâ„¢ System</ENAMEX> to explore other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> changes in various mutated strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] .
        In these archival cultures, it is assumed that the
        initial nutritional components were gradually depleted;
        however, some new molecules became available upon
        decomposition of dead cells. Mutant offspring that were
        best able to utilize the sparse nutritional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> would
        survive. Our long-term focus has been to characterize
        genetic differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and the putative
        parent, the sequenced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LT2</ENAMEX> strain. A goal is
        to develop gradients of preference from "most-to-least
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispensable</ENAMEX>" gene functions. As may be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tables 2</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, we observed a hierarchy of substrate utilization losses
        among strains.
        The additional observation that some archival strains
        gained metabolic capabilities is consistent with the
        reports that environmental pressures may induce changes in
        metabolic pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Entire
        metabolic pathways could be deactivated by the loss of a
        critical enzyme [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Bochner, 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] noted that when a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> is inserted to inactivate a xylose catabolic gene
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xylA</ENAMEX> ) metabolism of maltose and
        maltotriose were also lost in addition to xylose. Some of
        the primary energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in these archival cultures were
        likely to be exhausted, and thus cells might be expected to
        utilize secondary pathways, as noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groat</ENAMEX>, 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . DNA
        from dead cells might serve as a source of energy for
        bacterial cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finkel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] observed that
        cells that were able to utilize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> have a significant gain
        in fitness over competing cells that could not "eat" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PM1</TIMEX> plate and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PM3</TIMEX> plate
        contained nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> components and mutants were able to
        utilize these both as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] emphasized that certain genes could be
        eliminated without losing colony-forming ability. Among
        "excess baggage" genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments
        might include duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or fragments, fragments of
        ancestral genes that are no longer needed as the species
        evolved, and temperate viruses and insertion sequences.
        Although constitutive pathways might be needed to utilize
        the meager remaining nutrients, there would be less need
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        . Papadopoulos, 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arber</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] have
        presented interesting evidence of such genomic losses.
        Mutation under nutrient deprivation has been of interest
        from the dawn of bacterial genetics.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Decades ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwood</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] both reported
        that starvation serves as a selective condition for mutants
        with survival capabilities over the parental strain. In
        examining whether there was any priority in discarding of
        excess baggage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells in these vials,
        certain features would be obvious without any sophisticated
        analysis. An indication of this in the greater than
        expected reversion from auxotrophy to prototrophy and in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFGE</ENAMEX> data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        It is premature to build a model as to precise genetic
        changes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of storage in this restricted
        environment. However, our results support the view that: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        Gene functions are lost or rearranged in almost all (if not
        all) of the archival strains tested. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) There may be a
        hierarchy from "most-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dispensable</NUMEX>-to-least dispensable"
        substrate utilization for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and nitrogen
        molecules. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Since some food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> would be greatly
        diminished under starvation conditions, selected mutants in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> may discover secondary pathways.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Phenotype microarrays
          Cultures were taken from storage at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus 80Â°C</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Luria-Bertani Broth</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> with aeration
          overnight. After incubation, cultures were centrifuged
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX> Following centrifugation, the
          supernatant was decanted and inoculating fluid from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biologâ„¢</ENAMEX> was added to adjust the turbidity of the cell
          suspension to an absorbency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.105</NUMEX>. For analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Biologâ„¢ PM3 plates 150 Î</ENAMEX>¼l ferric citrate was also added
          to each tube of inoculating fluid. All necessary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrients</ENAMEX> and biochemicals were pre-filled and dried into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of the plates plus a water control. Tetrazolium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">violet</ENAMEX> was used as a redox dye to colorimetrically
          indicate the utilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and nitrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
          The microtiter plates were pre-warmed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> before
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> was inoculated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of cell suspension.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> containing a substrate that is oxidizable, a
          burst of respiration occurred and the cells reduced the
          tetrazolium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dye</ENAMEX> forming a purple color. Other wells
          remained colorless (as an indicator of loss of function
          in a catabolic step), as did the reference well
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PM1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plates</ENAMEX> were incubated
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 and 36-48 hours</TIMEX> respectively. Following
          incubation, the metabolism of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and
          nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> was measured spectrophotometrically at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570</NUMEX> nm, using a microtiter plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, and visually by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">scoring purple</ENAMEX> reactions in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> as a
          colorless negative control. The sequenced reference
          strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2004</NUMEX>) was included with each experimental group
          as a control. The biochemical reactions resulting in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrazolium</ENAMEX> color changes have been described by Bochner 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Archival strains
          The archival cultures were originally stocked
          beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> for the purpose of intra- and
          intergenic mapping. Each strain was auxotrophic for an
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, vitamin, or nucleotide. The isolates were
          stored in quintuplicate in small glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vials</ENAMEX> filled with
          nutrient agar and then sealed with paraffin. The
          collection has been stored at room temperature for over
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>. While many of the tubes have dried out, all
          tubes in which agar was not dried out yielded an average
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 3-10</NUMEX> 5colony-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Details of the strains
          used can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1with</ENAMEX> additional detailed
          information at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cancerresearchcenter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/table1.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Reference strain
          Our reference strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2004</NUMEX>) is assumed to be the
          parent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LT2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">archival strains</ENAMEX>. It was lyophilized at
          about the same time that the archival collection was
          being stored in agar stabs. The same strain was used for
          sequencing of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium genome completed at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX> sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. A paper
          detaining the sequence information [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] is now available
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wustl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. Also, a detailed tabulation
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutnick</ENAMEX>, 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> of compounds
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and nitrogen for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium LT2</ENAMEX> gave us an
          additional basis of comparison of our results with a
          strain studied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX>.
        
        
          MacConkey Agar
          Single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> suspensions were added to a MacConkey
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agar Base</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>.) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          different sugars. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>-percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) was added to
          each sector of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-quadrant plate. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XLD</ENAMEX> (a selective media for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> comprised of xylose,
          lysine, sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">desoxycholate</ENAMEX>, sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>, and
          ferric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium citrate</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>) was also
          included as an additional phenotypic test. The results of
          this assay provide information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 50</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their associated activity. A complete listing
          of the substrates in all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biologâ„</ENAMEX>¢ plates may be
