        Class B biosolids, the most common form of processed
        sewage sludges used in agriculture, are treated to reduce
        levels of pathogens by various processes including
        anaerobic digestion and pH elevation (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime stabilisation</ENAMEX>).
        The finished product may contain a wide variety of
        contaminants with a potential for adverse health effects [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . This includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enteric bacteria</ENAMEX>, viruses, endotoxins,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inorganic</ENAMEX> and organic sulfides, volatile fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, alkyl
        amines, and ammonia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . No formal pathogens risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> has been carried out for public exposure to
        Class B biosolids [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ; and, complaints of sludge-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illnesses</ENAMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> have not been previously
        studied.
        Retrospective studies have been done on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> exposed
        to sewage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sludges</ENAMEX> who have reported illnesses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gregersen et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , for example, investigated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who
        experienced fever and flu-like symptoms after repairing a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decanter</ENAMEX> used for concentrating sludge at a sewage
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. High concentrations of 
        Legionella pneumophila (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serogroup 1</ENAMEX>)
        found in the sludge along with positive antibody titers in
        all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> indicated that they developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>
        fever from contact with sludge. Similarly, NIOSH
        investigated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> complaining of headaches, stomach
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cramps</ENAMEX>, and diarrhoea at a sludge processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> isolated a variety of enteric,
        opportunistic pathogens from bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sludge samples</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airborne</ENAMEX> particulates, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of the genera 
        Mycobacterium , 
        Pseudomonas , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus</ENAMEX> . Based on the nature
        and timing of their symptoms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> concluded that
        ingestion or inhalation of pathogens in sewage sludge
        probably caused the illnesses.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorn et al</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, found no elevated risks
        of infection in the only epidemiological study done with
        residents exposed to sewage sludges [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of
        this prospective study, however, did not determine whether
        any pathogens were present in the material. Also, because
        of the low application rates used in the study, they
        cautioned against extrapolating their data to other
        sites.
        Our retrospective investigation was designed to use a
        survey for describing adverse effects reported by
        residents, develop an approach for assessing their
        environmental exposures, and evaluate whether any
        infections associated with exposure to sewage sludges were
        prevalent within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Surveying residents
          To indicate the general symptomatology, we surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> land application sites in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Questionnaires were patterned after a previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and based on symptoms
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with exposure to sewage sludges [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . More
          specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were queried about their symptoms
          and how much time elapsed between exposures and onset.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who were previously questioned by
          environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> were excluded from the survey and
          medical records were obtained in cases involving death or
          serious illnesses (those requiring medical
          attention).
          Using chi-squared analyses, proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          reporting a particular symptom at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> were compared
          with the combined reports for that symptom at all sites. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> indicated how consistently a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symptom</ENAMEX> was reported from site to site, that is, the
          degree to which numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> reporting a
          particular symptom at a given site could be expected
          based on the frequency of that symptom for all sites
          combined. Low 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values were indicative of
          symptoms that were largely independent of confounding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">health-related</ENAMEX> and environmental factors (e.g., previous
          medical history, demographics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of biosolids, and
          environmental conditions).
          This survey, which did not include an unexposed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, was primarily intended to describe and
          document self-reported illnesses. It also provided
          guidance on which exposure routes (e.g., contaminated
          drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, dermal contact, or inhalation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerosols</ENAMEX>) should be the focus of the research. Exposure,
          on the other hand, was evaluated using a dose-response
          curve in a separate part of the study concerning
          environmental assessments.
        
        
          Assessing environmental conditions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sludges</ENAMEX> used at all but one agricultural site
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>), according to county records, were limed or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to alkaline soils then exposed to weathering.
          Whether sludges used for mining reclamation in Osceola
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> were lime stabilised, however, was disputed.
          Residents reported that the area was limed after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sludging</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County</ENAMEX> records indicated that biosolids-related
          complaints for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> described in this
          study were concurrent with land application of Class B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosolids</ENAMEX>. In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Residents</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-22</NUMEX>),
          however, records indicated that dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, rather than
          biosolids, had been applied. Unconfirmed reports that
          dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> had been mixed with Class B biosolids prior
          to application at this site, however, precluded the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> from ruling out biosolids as a possible cause of
          the symptoms. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, soil in this
          area is naturally alkaline such that irritation similar
          to that observed with exposure to lime-stabilised sludge
          may occur.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> site was used to develop an approach for
          assessing exposures to windborne contaminants. At the
          site, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 132 metric tons</NUMEX> (dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wt</ENAMEX>) of Class B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biosolids</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">318 kg</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stockhausen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">644BC</ENAMEX> cationic polymer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stockhausen, Inc.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greensboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>) were applied to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-ha</NUMEX> field in late
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1995</TIMEX>. The field was located at the end of a paved
          road with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> (A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-H</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
          Historical records of symptoms experienced in the
          neighbourhood were kept by one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX>
          began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 2 weeks</TIMEX> after sludges were applied
          and continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately two years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-96</TIMEX>).
          Descriptions of symptoms included coughing, burning eyes,
          burning throat, congestion, and difficulty in
          breathing.
          To evaluate wind conditions at the site at the time
          sewage sludge was applied, we used a computer program
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WRPLOT Version 3.5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>), topographic information, and historical weather
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pease Air Force Base</ENAMEX> located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 5 km</NUMEX>
          from the site. Exposure times (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>), which were based on
          duration of wind passing directly from the field toward
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, were determined from wind frequency data
          averaged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three 8-day</TIMEX> periods after sludges were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between October 31 - November 23, 1995</TIMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Distances</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) each household resided from the nearest
          edge of the treated field were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23</NUMEX> (A, B); <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">77</NUMEX> (C), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>); 130 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>); 280 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>).
          Concentrations of air pollutants to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
          were exposed, relative to concentrations over the treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, were predicted using an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Source Complex</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ISC3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dispersion Model</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This prediction was not
          specific for any pollutant. Instead, it was used as a
          means for possibly ruling out the effects of ammonia,
          organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amines</ENAMEX>, or other gaseous or volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>.
          Should airborne chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contaminants</ENAMEX> be present only at
          a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fraction of a percent</NUMEX> of the concentrations present
          over the treated field, the result would argue against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airborne</ENAMEX> chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> as a cause of adverse
          effects. If, on the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> are
          sufficiently concentrated to cause burning eyes and other
          symptoms of irritation at the application site, these
          same effects may occur among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in areas where
          pollutant concentrations are not highly diluted.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ISC3</NUMEX> air dispersion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is designed to predict
          concentrations of pollutants off site based on emission
          rates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and local
          meteorological conditions. This approach is unreliable
          when emission rates cannot be accurately determined.
          Microbiological process rates, which largely control
          emission rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">airborne pollutants</ENAMEX> produced by sewage
          sludges, are highly unpredictable. To circumvent this
          problem, the model was used only to predict the relative
          concentrations of air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> between the treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> and potentially affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>. This approach
          is based on the dispersion of air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> as winds
          carry them over land surfaces, irrespective of their
          emission rates at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Residents survey
          Demographic data for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> surveyed, along
          with their symptoms, are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The average
          age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> were female; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. Residents who complained of adverse effects
          lived within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 1 km</NUMEX> of the treated fields.
          Symptoms were primarily associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where
          freshly applied, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime-stabilised sewage sludges</ENAMEX> remained
          on the surface and were exposed to wind erosion.
          The primary complaints (a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> or more reporting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symptom</ENAMEX>) within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 h</NUMEX> of exposure were coughing (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          sites), burning throat (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sites), burning eyes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> sites), and headaches (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> sites). Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> developed nasal and chest congestion (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          sites), difficulty in breathing (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> sites),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>/vomiting (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> sites), fatigue (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> sites),
          and flu-like symptoms (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sites). In some cases,
          symptoms of chemical irritation (e.g., burning eyes,
          burning throat) recurred for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year</TIMEX> after
          applications ceased.
          Proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> reporting coughing and
          burning throats exhibited the greatest consistency from
          site to site ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>, respectively). Half
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> reported bacterial, viral or fungal
          infections within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> of exposure (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> sites).
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> also reported symptoms indicating exposure
          to infectious micro-organisms or microbial products
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">endotoxins</NUMEX>). These included flu-like symptoms (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          sites), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>/vomiting (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> sites), diarrhoea (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          sites), rashes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> sites), and sinusitis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          sites).
          The most common infections identified by medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> were caused by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>,
          including the additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> identified in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robesonia</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> indicated that one infection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. lugdunensis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resident</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>) was
          probably hospital-acquired. Affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> recalled that respiratory infections
          experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> treated
          by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> responded to erythromycin, an
          antibiotic primarily used for treating <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> positive
          bacterial infections.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menifee</ENAMEX>, CA, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> complaining of
          chemical irritation developed different staphylococcal
          infections. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resident</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> experienced recurrent 
          S. aureus infections of the nasal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passages</ENAMEX> and oral cavity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> was hospitalised for
          an invasive 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> epidermitis infection that
          developed approximately <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> after an undressed
          surgical incision became contaminated with sand blowing
          from an adjacent field treated with Class B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosolids</ENAMEX>.
          Mild chronic maxillary sinusitis in one child
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Resident 18</ENAMEX>) living in this household deteriorated into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recurrent</ENAMEX> (unidentified) bacterial infections. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> responded poorly to oral and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> antibiotic
          therapy, tonsillectomy, and removal of the adenoids.
          Rigorous antibiotic therapy, including intramuscular
          injections of rocephrine, also yielded unsatisfactory
          results.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County</ENAMEX> records showed that Class B biosolids were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to an adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> at the time the
          above-mentioned illnesses developed. The paediatrician
          treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the area (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Pumphrey</ENAMEX>) noted
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> living near the land application sites
          appeared to develop abnormally persistent sinusitis.
        
        
          Environmental assessment
          Samples of sludges collected at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> site, which
          were frozen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, retained a strong faecal odour.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were identified as common <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative
          environmental isolates and included

          indicated that adverse effects from exposure to airborne
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> from the land application site could not be
          ruled out as a cause of adverse health effects. Air

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> cases involving mortality from 
          S. aureus occurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          who directly contacted freshly applied biosolids. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osceola Mills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> with
          an unremarkable medical history died of staphylococcal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">septicaemia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed a sore throat,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headaches</ENAMEX>, and furuncles on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> leg and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> within
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> after riding a motorbike through sewage
          sludges applied nearby for mine reclamation purposes. A
          primary care physician prescribed antibiotics and the
          patient was admitted to the hospital <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>
          with difficulty in breathing and high fever.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> was isolated from skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          antibiotics were administered. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">septicaemia</ENAMEX> and expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> after contacting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosolids</ENAMEX>. Mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the same area requested a
          health hazard evaluation after experiencing similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> and skin irritation symptoms that they
          attributed to biosolids exposure.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mortality was associated with an outbreak
          of 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Robesonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PA.</ENAMEX>
          According to state records, Class B, lime-stabilised
          sewage sludges from a local wastewater treatment facility
          were applied to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> fields comprising a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          acres. Applications began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in1988</TIMEX> and continued through
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1995</TIMEX>. Sewage sludges were applied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> at a rate of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,300 tons</NUMEX> (dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wt</ENAMEX>) per
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> living in or frequenting the house
          where the outbreak occurred, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> developed 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus infections</ENAMEX> over a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year period</TIMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1993</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was located across a paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> approximately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200 m</ENAMEX> from the treated field. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (Patients
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 7, 8</ENAMEX>) were granted hunting rights on the farmland and
          frequently <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">traversed</ENAMEX> treated areas during the application
          period.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> lived in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that were also located in close proximity to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><50 m</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> complained of odours,
          inundation with houseflies, and respiratory symptoms.
          They associated these problems with application of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosolids</ENAMEX>; however, they could not recall having any
          infections.
          Residents reported that feral <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> occupying a barn
          near the treated field had to be destroyed after
          developing multiple boils and weeping sores after sewage
          sludge applications began. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> site reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and
          numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets (dogs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>) developed boils after sewage
          sludges were applied. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pets</ENAMEX> may have served as a reservoir
          of staphylococcal infections in these neighbourhoods and,
          in some cases, transmitted their infections to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
          Medical records were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patients 1, 3, 8</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 1</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          year-old male with a history of excellent health, was
          treated for a furuncle of the knee in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February1993</TIMEX> then
          succumbed to 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aureus pneumonia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX>
          after contracting a rotavirus infection and viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. Each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> who frequented the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house (≥ 2 d/wk</ENAMEX>) was also infected with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 3</ENAMEX>) developed furuncles concurrently with
          dermatophytic infections (identified as tinea
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cruris/tinea corpora</ENAMEX>). All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (Patients
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7</ENAMEX>) sought medical attention. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          self-treated using antibiotics prescribed for other
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The last 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> infection at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robesonia</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 8</ENAMEX>) occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately two years</TIMEX> after
          biosolids applications ceased.
          Overall, the prevalence of 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus infections</ENAMEX> in this study
          was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times higher than
          infections among hospitalised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a recognised risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> for 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> irritants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with biosolids include
        endotoxins, lime, ammonia, and alkyl amines. These
        contaminants may cause allergic and non-allergic reactions
        that could contribute to broncho-obstructive and
        inflammatory responses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, for example, experienced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coughing</ENAMEX>, burning eyes, burning throat, headaches,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">congestion</ENAMEX> and difficulty in breathing within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> while
        conducting a site visit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menifee</ENAMEX>, CA. The visit occurred
        during a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were reporting these same
        symptoms. Although high winds were blowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> from the
        treated fields, no odour was evident at that time. This
        experience argued against attributing the symptoms to
        odour-related psychosomatic responses, which are thought to
        play an important role in self-reported illnesses
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with human and animal waste-treatment operations
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The lower human colon is the primary reservoir for 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> ; therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        is a common sewage contaminant. It is known to survive
        desiccation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and can be aerially
        transmitted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . It tends to invade irritated tissue
        and infections are a common complication of diaper rash
        after prolonged contact with urine and faeces [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Although it can be part of the natural skin and nasal
        microflora, risks of infection vary widely among different
        strains and increase with exposure to virulent strains from
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. It is a leading cause of nosocomial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and surgical site and bloodstream infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] ; however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> considered it to be a low risk to
        public health with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> applied sewage sludges [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        In the case of recurrent 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus infections</ENAMEX> in Robesonia
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), it was evident that a persistent source of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> was present. It was
        unclear, however, whether the strain(s) responsible for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> had a common environmental source lasting for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> or if certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> became
        persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> and continued to expose others even
        after land application ceased. Residents reported that
        tilling the heavily treated soil still, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years later</TIMEX>,
        draws large swarms of houseflies to the area.
        A lack of any documented risk of staphylococcal
        infections among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> processing and handling wastewater
        and sewage sludges may reflect the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are
        more immunocompetent than the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, or that
        adequate epidemiological studies have not been done. It may
        also reflect differences in exposure routes; or, it may
        suggest that incubation in the field can lead to increased
        concentrations or virulence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        Risks of infection with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> may also depend on
        environmental processes that enhance the ability of sewage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sludges</ENAMEX> to irritate the skin and respiratory tract. As <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>
        negative bacteria die off after sludge application,
        endotoxin concentrations (a potential source of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bronco-</ENAMEX>pulmonary irritation) increase. As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sludges dry</ENAMEX> in
        the field, lime and other irritant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> become
        concentrated and, therefore, may be more irritating upon
        dermal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> and inhalation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> guidelines advise wearing protective gear and
        exercising good personal hygiene when handling Class B
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosolids</ENAMEX> or exposed to the aerosols [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] . The nature
        and timing of symptoms reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> suggest that
        steps should also be taken to protect the public from
        exposure to airborne contaminants from land application
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-dispersion</ENAMEX> models, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used in this
        study, could provide guidance in selecting application
        sites where exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> would be minimal.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osceola Mills</ENAMEX> case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robesonia</ENAMEX> outbreak, and the
        occurrence of staphylococcal infections among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at
        other land application sites suggest that risks land
        application practices pose from these pathogens may be
        higher than expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> contaminants in sludges,
        which irritate the skin and mucous membranes, may be
        responsible for an increased host susceptibility.
        Further research is needed to address illnesses among
        residents exposed to Class B biosolids, especially airborne
        dusts, and the role irritant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> may play in risks
        posed by low levels of pathogens.
