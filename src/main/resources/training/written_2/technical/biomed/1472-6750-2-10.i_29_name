        Jet injection is a relatively simple and low-cost method
        for gene transfer into somatic tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Aside from
        the injector, no special equipment or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> are
        required. Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is suspended at the desired
        concentration in one of several types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and
        injected into tissue. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> construct can
        be injected simultaneously. Injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> encoding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> can be combined with either adjuvants or plasmids
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encoding immune enhancing cytokines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low-volume</ENAMEX> jet
        injection deliberately limits the volume of the injected
        solution and is utilized to target delivery to small tissue
        areas [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, multiple different routes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> immunization
        have been used successfully [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Particle bombardment of
        skin is reported to be superior to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-dermal</ENAMEX> and
        intra-muscular needle and syringe injection for induction
        of immunity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> when compared directly [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aotus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, intra-dermal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccine</ENAMEX> by needle and syringe is reported to be more
        effective at inducing an immune response than
        intra-muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> by needle and syringe [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">High-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) of either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into ovine muscle or mammary gland [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate muscle sites in rabbits [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] induces humoral immunity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Multiple</ENAMEX> studies have demonstrated that particle
        bombardment of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elicits immune</ENAMEX> responses in larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, high-volume jet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) of either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 or 250</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into the skin
        of primates induces immunity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Delivery to the oral
        mucosa by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> injection elicited a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgA</ENAMEX> response than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intranasal</ENAMEX> delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . However, none of these
        studies compared different intracutaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> delivery
        methods within the same study.
        This investigation tested the ability of low-volume jet
        injection to target delivery of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccine</ENAMEX> to the skin
        for the purpose of inducing immunity. A direct comparison
        of the new methodology to the established techniques of
        particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection was
        performed. The experiments demonstrated that low-volume jet
        injection successfully induced immunity in rabbits.
        Moreover, there were no significant differences between jet
        injection and particle bombardment in the maximal antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titers</ENAMEX> or number of injections before response. In contrast
        no rabbits receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccine</ENAMEX> by needle and syringe
        injection developed an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response. In the low-volume
        jet injection and particle bombardment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, gene
        expression levels in the skin did not predict the magnitude
        of the immune response. While immune responses were
        comparable, luciferase gene expression levels in the skin
        following particle bombardment were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> times higher
        than low-volume jet injection.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection targets delivery of a
          plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA solution</ENAMEX> to the epidermis and dermis of
          rabbits
          Injection path lengths were measured following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> ink solution.
          Injection paths averaged <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 0.5 mm</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> mm
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The injection paths did not extend through
          the dermis. These experiments show that low-volume jet
          injection specifically targeted delivery of a DNA
          solution to the skin and that the injection paths did not
          reach into the underlying tissue.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Optimal</ENAMEX> injection parameters for each technique were
          established by comparing relative mean expression levels
          of the luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene in the skin <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>
          after injection. Injection parameters that yielded the
          highest levels of luciferase expression were selected as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX>. Particle bombardment produced the highest mean
          levels of luciferase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Mean luciferase
          activity following low-volume jet injection was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-100
          fold lower than following particle bombardment. Mean
          luciferase activity following needle and syringe

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rabbits immunized by low-volume jet injection
          demonstrated a statistically significant and titratable
          response at serial time points that persisted through day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>,

          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 56</TIMEX>). The number of injections before response and
          the maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> responses were comparable to rabbits
          that received <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> immunization by particle bombardment.
          By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 14</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rabbits immunized
          by particle bombardment demonstrated a statistically
          significant response at serial time points (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          One rabbit expired during anesthesia at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-injection time point. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 56</TIMEX> the immune response
          was statistically significant only at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250</ENAMEX> dilution
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> remaining rabbits (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:250 dilution</TIMEX>;
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.609</NUMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:2,500 dilution).
          There was no statistically significant difference in
          maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> titers between low-volume jet injection
          and particle bombardment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.875</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In contrast
          to immunization with either low-volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> or particle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bombardment</ENAMEX>, there was no significant titratable antibody
          response in rabbits that received <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> immunization by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">needle</ENAMEX> and syringe injection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.062</NUMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:250 dilution</TIMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.140</NUMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:2,500 dilution
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 56</TIMEX>). Longer-term experiments and larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rabbits</ENAMEX> will be required to determine if persistence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is different between the low-volume jet injected
          and particle bombardment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          The experiments demonstrate that intradermal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccine</ENAMEX> can be utilized
          to elicit immune responses. The low-volume jet injection
          method was comparable to the more established technique
          of particle bombardment and was significantly better than
          the established technique of needle and syringe
          injection.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection is an effective new methodology
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intradermal DNA immunization</ENAMEX> that has advantages over
        the established techniques of needle and syringe injection
        and particle bombardment. It is more effective than needle
        and syringe injection and is simpler to perform than
        particle bombardment because the plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA solution</ENAMEX> can
        be injected directly rather than being precipitated onto
        specific particles. High levels of gene expression were not
        required for successful intradermal genetic immunization by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection. Gene expression levels following
        particle bombardment were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> fold higher than those
        found following low-volume jet injection but the immune
        response was equivalent. The disassociation between local
        gene expression levels in the injected skin and immune
        response is consistent with a previous report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Plasmids
          A plasmid encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBSAg</ENAMEX> under the control of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Human Cytomegalovirus Immediate Early</ENAMEX> gene I (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HCMVIE1</NUMEX>)
          enhancer/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pRc/CMV-HBs</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) was obtained from

          enhancer/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pHCMVIE1</NUMEX>-luciferase) was used to
          measure relative gene expression levels following gene
          transfer by low-volume jet injection, particle
          bombardment and needle and syringe injection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          Plasmids were propagated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DH5Î±</NUMEX> cells and purified by
          Bio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merlin Core</ENAMEX> Services (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>, skin preparation, and injection

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> were
          obtained at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-3 kg</NUMEX> in weight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were purchased from
          a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). Health status
          was evaluated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> and the animals
          were free of tested pathogens (other than 
          Bordetella bronchiseptica and
          rotavirus but these were not expected to interfere with
          the current study). The rabbits were in excellent health
          and not symptomatic. The rabbits were anesthetized with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">40 mg/kg Ketamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 mg/ml,</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Xylazine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>) prior to each injection. In preparation for
          injection, the dorsal skin was shaved, treated with a
          depilatory, and washed with a chlorhexidine scrub
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. Following injections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buprenorphine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml) was given for analgesia.
          To establish skin penetration depth following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection, one rabbit was injected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          different sites with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> ink solution. The skin
          was removed at necropsy and examined under a dissecting
          microscope to measure the length of the injection <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>.
          To establish optimal injection conditions for low-volume
          jet injection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> were injected at a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          sites per rabbit with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pHCMVIE1</NUMEX>-luciferase and euthanized
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h later</TIMEX>. The injected skin was removed at necropsy and
          tested for luciferase activity. When using particle
          bombardment the goal is to deliver the majority of gold
          particles into the epithelial cell layer rather than the
          deeper, less cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dermis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . To establish skin
          penetration depth following particle bombardment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          rabbits were injected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on each rabbit. The
          skin was removed at necropsy and fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> neutral
          formalin, embedded by standard methods, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-micron
          sections were prepared. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin stained
          sections were examined under the microscope to determine
          the penetration depth. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold particles</ENAMEX> were found
          distributed primarily in the epidermis and minimally in
          the superficial dermis of the rabbit skin (data not
          shown). To establish optimal injection conditions for
          particle bombardment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> were injected at a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> per rabbit with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pHCMVIE1</NUMEX>-luciferase and
          euthanized <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h later</TIMEX>. The injected skin was removed at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necropsy</ENAMEX> and tested for luciferase activity. To establish
          optimal conditions for intra-dermal needle and syringe
          injection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> were injected at a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          sites per rabbit with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pHCMVIE1</NUMEX>-luciferase and euthanized
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h later</TIMEX>. The injected skin was removed at necropsy and
          tested for luciferase activity.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunization</ENAMEX> experiments, rabbits were
          injected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three time</TIMEX> points at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> intervals: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was obtained
          from an ear vein prior to each injection and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and final injection.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rabbits that received particle

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection was performed with a
          prototype low-volume jet injector with adjustable

          pressures (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,2 and 3-Bar</NUMEX>) were tested. When using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">low-volume</ENAMEX> jet injection for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intradermal</TIMEX> delivery the
          goal is contain the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidermis</ENAMEX> and dermis but optimize gene expression levels.
          Conditions for optimal gene expression were established
          by testing luciferase activity in the skin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> h following
          injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pHCMVIE1</NUMEX>-luciferase. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> rapid injections

          Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid DNA</ENAMEX>. The injected fluid remained within the
          dermis under all conditions. The delivery volume with the
          highest mean luciferase expression was chosen as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX> delivery condition for the immunization studies.
          This optimal setting of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 Î¼l/28 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid DNA</ENAMEX> delivered
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-Bar was utilized for each immunization time

          activity in the skin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> h following injection of
          pHCMVIE1-luciferase. The set of conditions (pressure/PVP
          concentration/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and DNA amounts) with the highest mean
          luciferase expression and optimal skin penetration was
          chosen as the optimal combination for immunization
          studies. This optimal setting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Î¼g plasmid DNA
