        Many eukaryotic genes are interrupted by stretches of
        non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> called introns or intervening sequences.
        Transcription of these genes is followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-splicing
        that results in intron removal (for review, see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The majority of eukaryotic spliceosomal introns interrupt
        pre-mRNA in the nucleus and are removed by a
        ribonucleoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, termed the spliceosome. Two
        theories have been proposed to explain the present
        spliceosomal intron distribution; i.e., their presence in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and their absence in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. The
        first, "introns-early", posits that introns were present in
        most, if not all, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> in the last
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> common ancestor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUCA</ENAMEX>) and have subsequently been
        lost in the archaeal and bacterial domains due to strong
        selection for compact genomes. Eukaryotes have maintained
        their introns because they confer the capacity to create
        evolutionary novelty through exon shuffling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
        introns-early theory predicts that at least some of the
        extant eukaryotic introns are direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the
        primordial sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LUCA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The
        alternate view, "introns-late", suggests that the last
        common ancestor was intron-free and that spliceosomal
        introns have originated in eukaryotes from recent invasions
        by autocatalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns) or
        transposable elements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . The introns-late view
        is compatible with the now-established role of exon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shuffling</ENAMEX> in creating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . It is the
        ancient origin of introns that is primarily called into
        question.
        In this study, we analyzed the putative spliceosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascomycota</ENAMEX>) small subunit (SSU)
        and large subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> (r)<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] to
        understand how spliceosomal introns of a recent origin
        (i.e., introns-late) spread to novel genic sites.
        Statistical methods were used to study the exon sequences
        flanking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> different spliceosomal intron insertion sites
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> rRNA and show that the introns interrupt
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - intron - G</ENAMEX> (hereafter, the intron position is shown
        with -) proto-splice site that pre-existed in the coding
        region. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">proto-splice</NUMEX> site is a short sequence motif that
        has a high affinity for splicing factors and is a preferred
        site of intron insertion. The proto-splice site (e.g., MAG
        - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> in pre-mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ) need not be perfectly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in organisms but is rather a set of nucleotides
        that, with some statistical uncertainty, shows a non-random
        sequence pattern at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> flanking introns. It is also
        conceivable that proto-splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may differ between
        lineages reflecting, for example, differences in how the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spliceosome</ENAMEX> recognizes introns (e.g., exon definition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] ).
        Our analysis using information theory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] shows that
        the significant information is found in exons flanking rRNA
        spliceosomal introns. We also confirm that introns are not
        randomly distributed in the primary and secondary structure
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns are
        generally found in the highly conserved (i.e., functionally
        important) regions of these genes, whereas the spliceosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> tend to occur in regions of the rRNA that are not
        as well conserved or are not directly involved in protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>.

          we first tested for the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a proto-splice</NUMEX> site
          flanking the introns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>
          analysis, the null hypothesis specified that nucleotide
          usage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> nt of exon sequence upstream and downstream
          of the different intron insertion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was random and
          dependent on the nucleotide composition of Euascomycetes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA sequences in general. Previously, we
          found evidence for the proto-splice site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, in
          Euascomycetes rRNA with the greatest support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < 0.001 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ). The addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">new Euascomycetes SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA insertion sites in the
          new analysis supports this finding (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) but shows
          strongest evidence for the proto-splice site to encode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < 0.01 [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three degrees</NUMEX> of freedom]), with the Gs
          occurring at frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65% and 61%</NUMEX> in the
          Euascomycetes rRNAs.
          To address the possibility that we were counting as
          independent events cases where introns may have had a
          single origin but then spread into neighboring sites
          through intron sliding [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ], we reran the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> analysis after removal of all introns that
          were within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 nt</NUMEX> of each other. This substantially
          reduced our data set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> introns at the following
          sites; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SSU - 265</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">297, 330, 390, 400, 514, 674, 882, 939,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1057, 1071, 1083, 1226, 1514</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU - 678</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">711, 775, 824,</ENAMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2076, 2445</TIMEX>, but addressed independence of intron
          insertion events. This data set showed significant
          support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> proto-splice site with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, occurring at frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.56</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0055</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.48</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0000</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.35</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0000</NUMEX>),
          respectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - G</ENAMEX> proto-splice sites
          occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 and 15</NUMEX> of these sequences, respectively.
          The increase in signal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> proto-splice site
          with removal of neighboring (potentially slid) introns is
          consistent with the idea that intron sliding may over
          time obscure the targets originally used for insertion.
          It should be noted, however, that this procedure was done
          by retaining the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">5</ENAMEX>' intron in each set of
          neighboring insertions and this may not represent the
          original intron. Determining the role of intron sliding
          in creating new lineages of insertions will require a
          fully resolved Euascomycetes phylogeny (not yet
          available) that can be used to map intron gains, losses,
          and potential slides. The present data for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> - 337
          spliceosomal introns, for example, when mapped on the
          Euascomycetes <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> published in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhattacharya et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          ] shows these introns to be distributed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX>
          divergent clades within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lecanoromycetes</ENAMEX>. These
          introns may be related through the sliding of an
          ancestral intron but without the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> in a non-Euascomycetes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> or a robust
          phylogeny of this lineage, it will not be possible to
          unambiguously identify the original site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>.

          Next, we used the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sequence Logo</ENAMEX>" method developed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schneider</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] to determine the information content in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> rRNA introns and exon flanking
          sequence. The logo of a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> of the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>
          spliceosomal introns for which we had complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nt of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nt of downstream exon sequence is shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This analysis shows that many of the
          informative sites encode purines (in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gs</ENAMEX>) and
          that the region contains a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.91 bits</NUMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the information content is highest at the site
          of intron insertion and the regions within a close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proximity</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> nt), and decreases as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves away
          from this site, with the exception of a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U+G</ENAMEX>
          peak at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-48</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>richness <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around +40</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
          comparison, the mean value (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 iterations</NUMEX>) for the
          total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of information in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nt random sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.68 bits</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> quantile for this
          distribution was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.47 bits</NUMEX> indicating that the
          Euascomycetes rRNA exons encode significant information
          (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Logo analysis of the reduced set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          non-neighboring spliceosomal introns was consistent with
          this analysis but showed a stronger signal at the
          proto-splice site (A = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.31 bits</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.52 bits</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bits</ENAMEX>). The finding of significant information in the
          flanking exons suggests that some regulatory regions
          (i.e., exonic splicing enhancers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESEs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] may
          exist in these sequences.

          Intrigued by the finding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-richness in the upstream
          exon region flanking introns (see <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-17</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          we determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-rich regions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1434</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fungal SSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">880</NUMEX> fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs with all
          reported spliceosomal introns in these genes. The
          G-frequencies were calculated at each rRNA site and are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plotted</ENAMEX> as the green circles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> nt
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U53879</ENAMEX>]) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3554</TIMEX> nt [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U53879</TIMEX>]) rRNAs from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae were used as the reference sequence for
          these alignments. The raw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies were smoothed
          (blue curve in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), using the loess local regression
          method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , and smoothing windows of size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nt or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nt, prior to analyzing the intron-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>. The positions of rRNA spliceosomal intron
          positions are shown as red lines in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. From this
          analysis we can observe that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of intron insertion
          strongly associate with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies in both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is stronger in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nt</ENAMEX> (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 nt exon sequence - intron insertion</NUMEX> site -
          25 nt exon sequence) window of weighted averages,
          suggesting that this window size includes most of the
          exon signal. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is still apparent
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nt window, in particular for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA.
          Our analyses show that the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequency at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> intron sites using the fitted curve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.34</NUMEX>, whereas the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequency at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> intron
          sites using the fitted curve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>. To
          test the significance of this result with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> intron
          sites and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-contents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA, we randomly
          selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3554</TIMEX> nt of rRNA and computed
          the average of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies. We repeated this
          process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times and plotted the distribution of
          these average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies (results not shown). The
          observed average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequency at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was
          significantly greater than that in the simulated data (p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0268</NUMEX>). Similarly, we carried out the simulation-based
          test for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA intron sites. In these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
          replications, no average from the randomly generated
          sites was greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.34</NUMEX>. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value is less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>, reinforcing the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA introns and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-rich regions apparent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          Taken together, our results suggest that Euascomycetes
          rRNA spliceosomal introns are fixed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - G</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> -
          G proto-splice site that is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-rich regions.

          eukaryotic organelles (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3Dom2O</NUMEX>) and the nuclear-encoded
          rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phylogenetic domains (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3Dom</NUMEX>). This
          analysis shows a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of group I
          intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with rRNA sites that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98-100%</NUMEX> conserved
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both 3Dom2O</TIMEX> and 3Dom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA analyses (see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom</TIMEX> analysis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA was the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> weakly non-significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0577</NUMEX>). The
          observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of highly conserved rRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
          intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is, therefore, unlikely to have occurred by
          chance alone. For rRNA spliceosomal introns, however, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of conserved rRNA and introns <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is less
          clear. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom2O</TIMEX> analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA,
          spliceosomal intron positions vary significantly from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">null</ENAMEX> model but in the direction of fewer than expected
          introns at the most highly conserved sites, whereas
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom</TIMEX> analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA no significant
          difference is found (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0969</NUMEX>). The 3Dom2O <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA and
          3Dom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA analyses both show an enrichment of
          spliceosomal introns at the highly conserved genic sites
          (primarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> conserved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 90-97%</NUMEX>). Taken
          together, our analyses suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns are
          fixed primarily in the most highly conserved rRNA sites
          when analyzed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom2O</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Dom</ENAMEX> data sets, whereas
          spliceosomal introns are not strongly associated with
          highly conserved rRNA sites.
          To address more directly the relationship between
          Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns and rRNA conservation
          patterns, we positioned these introns on a conservation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagram</ENAMEX> generated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1042</TIMEX> fungal SSU rRNA sequences
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This analysis showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA spliceosomal introns follow sites that are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX> of the fungal sequences (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1114</TIMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-95%</NUMEX> conserved (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> nt in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introns
          follow sites that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-89%</NUMEX> conserved (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> nt in this
          class), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> follow sites that <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX> nt in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>). More importantly,
          inspection of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> nt alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3554</TIMEX>
          nt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs of all fungi, of fungi containing
          spliceosomal introns, and of fungi lacking spliceosomal
          introns shows that most of the introns are inserted
          between nucleotides that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99-100%</NUMEX> conserved (whether
          they encode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - G</ENAMEX> or not) in taxa containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister groups</ENAMEX> lacking introns (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This result
          provides strong support for the hypothesis that
          Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns are fixed in a
          proto-splice site that pre-dates intron insertion. Beyond
          this pattern of conservation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-rich regions in the
          neighborhood of introns are also often highly conserved
          among all fungi (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gs</ENAMEX> are in
          sites that are ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> conserved in all fungal SSU rRNAs,
          suggesting that their existence also pre-dates intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>.
          However, several exceptions to this general pattern
          merit closer inspection. The upstream nucleotide at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">297</NUMEX> site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">369</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae gene), for example,
          occurs at a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> in taxa lacking introns
          but at a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.8%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> in taxa containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX>.
          On the surface, this suggests that the site may have
          undergone selective pressure, post-intron insertion,
          towards a high frequency of Us. Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA
          alignment shows, however, that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> taxa containing the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX> intron share a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> with virtually all
          other intron-containing fungi that lack this particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> frequency in the
          intron-containing fungi is a synapomorphy for the
          monophyletic intron-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> and is not
          an outcome of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX> intron insertion. A similar result
          is found when the proto-splice site is checked in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">taxa</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> with those lacking any particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Intron Positions on the rRNA Primary
          Structure
          The positions of spliceosomal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>, and
          archaeal introns were included on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> representing the
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          The intron distributions were then studied to determine
          if they differ significantly from the null hypothesis of
          a "broken-stick" distribution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . This resource
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> model, which has been used extensively to test
          hypotheses about patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species abundance</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] ], specifies a distribution that arises when a
          "stick" of unit length is divided into n number of events
          with these events scattered with a uniform probability
          distribution. The events break the stick into n + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          intervals which can then be studied to determine if they
          depart from uniformity in the probability density along
          the stick. Departure will tend to make the longest
          intervals longer and the shortest intervals shorter [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] . In our analyses, the rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were the sticks and
          the intron insertion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were the events. The metric
          used to compare the null (i.e., broken-stick) and
          observed distribution was the standard deviation (SD)
          from the mean interval length; i.e., lower SDs mean the
          more uniform are the lengths of the intervals [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          ] ]. Computer simulations were used to determine the
          level of significance at which the observed distributions
          could be distinguished from those produced by the
          broken-stick model.
          A cursory analysis of the data suggests that the
          intron distribution in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs is
          significantly clustered (in particular, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA) and
          the statistical analysis bears this out. The observed
          standard deviations for all the analyses (i.e., all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> together or the spliceosomal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns
          individually) are significantly different from the
          expectations of the broken stick model. The departure
          from the null <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is particularly striking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX>
          rRNA, suggesting that the introns in this gene are more
          strongly clustered than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4A,4<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The proto-splice site bounding rRNA introns
          Our analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nt of exon sequence flanking
          spliceosomal introns in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> rRNA shows
          significant support for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - G</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> proto-splice
          site (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The proto-splice site pre-dates intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> because it is highly conserved in the
          Euascomycetes rRNAs in both intron-containing and
          intron-less taxa (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This finding is
          not anomalous because analysis of exon sequences
          surrounding the total set of introns in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae pre-mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> shows
          a preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAG</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The
          final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> in this motif has been established as
          significantly conserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The sequence at
          the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon region is required for interactions
          with the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">particle U1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Our data are, therefore, consistent
          with present understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> pre-mRNA splicing.
          Furthermore, taking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 40%</NUMEX> as the minimum for a
          consensus nucleotide in the proto-splice site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long et</ENAMEX>
          al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] have shown that this region in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> often encode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G - G</ENAMEX> motif. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, for example, the nucleotides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> motif
          are found in abundances of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>,
          respectively. The finding of a similar motif in rRNA
          genes for which there is neither a requirement to
          incorporate amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> phase distribution nor to invoke
          exon-shuffling provides support for the idea that a
          proto-splice site for intron insertion not only exists in
          Euascomycetes rRNA but also may exist in pre-mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> appear to be inserted into some of the most
          conserved regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euascomycetes SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA, as evident
          in the fungal conservation diagram (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and the
          analysis of fungal nucleotide frequencies at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' nt flanking introns (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). However, the
          spliceosomal introns do not map to the most conserved
          positions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3Dom2O</NUMEX> rRNA datasets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Furthermore, exon sequences, outside of the
          proto-splice site, may be required for splice site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> by the spliceosome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Our
          rRNA analyses suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-rich regions in the
          neighborhood (often upstream) of the intron insertion
          sites may be potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESEs</ENAMEX>. The exon context may,
          therefore, play a fundamental role in controlling intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> and, thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of intron fixation. This idea
          has growing support in the literature [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 38 39</NUMEX> ]
          ]. Combined with this observation is the finding that
          rRNA spliceosomal introns map primarily to regions in the
          interface surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> ribosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          These sites presumably facilitate intron splicing during
          ribosome biogenesis.
          We find that in contrast to the spliceosomal introns
          in rRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I intron insertion sites show a stronger
          positive association with highly conserved rRNA regions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), including those that bind tRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          , and are more clustered than are spliceosomal introns in
          the rRNA primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This suggests that
          group I intron fixation may be even more highly
          constrained by the exon context than are spliceosomal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. A possible explanation for this observation is
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns are more dependent on specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream exon sequences to build the P1
          and P10 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] to facilitate proper folding prior
          to excision [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ]). This could limit the number
          of rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns can be fixed in
          comparison to spliceosomal introns which have less
          specific exon sequence requirements for splicing.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our findings provide concrete insights into rRNA intron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX> and are more compatible with the view that both
        the spliceosomal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I intron distributions reflect
        fundamental features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">present-day genes</ENAMEX> and genomes and
        that introns may not be relics of an ancient intron-rich
        period of cells. An intriguing view on intron origin was
        recently published using the tools of population genetics.
        In this view, the richness of introns in multicellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> may primarily reflect the smaller population
        sizes of these taxa relative to protists, which generally
        contain few introns. The large population sizes of
        unicellular eukaryotes may prevent widespread intron spread
        due to secondary mutations that lead to their loss from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, the lichenized
        Euascomycetes, which are particularly rich in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliceosomal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns in their nuclear rRNA, are
        typically extremely slow-growing taxa many of which have
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> sizes [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] ].

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA introns were not included in the information

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Analysis</ENAMEX> of the rRNA Introns
          An information analysis was done of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 nt</NUMEX> upstream
          and downstream of the different rRNA spliceosomal intron
          sites to determine the total amount of exonic information
          (in "bits") that is available to the spliceosome for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX>. We used the web-based logo program of Gorodkin
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dtu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dk/~gorodkin/appl/slogo.</ENAMEX>htmlto derive
          the sequence logos and the information content of
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was calculated according to the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Type 2 logos were
          drawn in which the height of the nucleotides in the
          sequence column represented their frequency in proportion
          to their expected frequency. The expected nucleotide
          probabilities were estimated from the observed nucleotide
          frequencies over all sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> Euascomycetes rRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (A = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>, C = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ).
          The nucleotides were turned upside-down when the observed
          frequency was less than expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
          spliceosomal intron sites, for which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nt of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream exon sequence are available, were
          included in this analysis.
          To put the information content in perspective, we also
          did simulations in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> random sequence data sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">length 100</ENAMEX> nt (for flanking exons) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> (total number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> analyzed) random data sets of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> nt
          (for conserved intron regions) were generated at the
          nucleotide frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> rRNA and the
          information content of these was calculated. A total of
          100,000 iterations were done with each data set to create
          null distributions of random information content. The
          observed information values were then compared to the
          null distributions to infer their probabilities.
        
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-Content</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Euascomycetes</ENAMEX> SSU
          rRNAs
          Because it is difficult to see the pattern of
          G-content along the sequence based on the raw data, we
          fit a smooth curve to the frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> using the
          method of local regression (loess, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ). This smooth
          curve captures the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-content pattern along the nucleotide
          sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loess</ENAMEX> is a nonparametric curve fitting technique
          that fits the data in a local fashion. That is, for the
          fit at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site x</ENAMEX>, the fit is made using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies at
          the points in a neighbourhood of x, weighted by their
          distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">x. A</ENAMEX> tricubic weighting function
          (proportional to [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - (distance/max distance)<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">^3</NUMEX>)^<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]) is
          used for calculating the weights. For both the LSUrRNA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSUrRNA</ENAMEX> sequence alignment data sets, we used a
          neighborhood of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nt (and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nt) in fitting the loess
          curve. Thus the value of the curve at each site is
          computed as a weighted average of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequency at the
          site itself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> up-stream sites,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> down-stream sites.
        
        
          Positions of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Introns Relative to Conserved</ENAMEX> rRNA
          Regions
          To assess the patterns of sequence conservation in
          exon sequences flanking all rRNA spliceosomal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
          introns, we mapped intron positions on structure
          conservation diagrams. Group I introns in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subclasses</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] ) which occupied the
          same rRNA site were counted as separate intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX>. This accounted for our observation that
          certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rRNA sites</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">788, 1199</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949, 2500</TIMEX>
          [see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX> for details]) are "hot" spots for insertion
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>, evolutionarily divergent introns being
          fixed at the same site in different species or in
          different genomes (i.e., nuclear vs. organellar). The
          actual number of independent hits at rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is,
          however, likely to be much greater than our estimate but
          this can only be proven with rigorous phylogenetic
          analysis of group I introns at different insertion sites
          to show that in some cases, introns in the same subclass
          at the same site in different species have a high
          probability of independent origin [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] ]. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX> used in our analysis
          was based on the comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6389 and 922</NUMEX> different SSU
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA sequences, respectively, from the three
          phylogenetic domains and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organelles (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3Dom2O</NUMEX>) that
          were superimposed on the secondary structures of the 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli rRNAs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          set of diagrams was a summary of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5591 and 585</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA sequences, respectively, from the three
          phylogenetic domains (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3Dom</NUMEX>) also mapped on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli rRNAs</ENAMEX>. These diagrams are
          available at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX>. Multiway contingency table
          analysis was done to determine whether sites that were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98-100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-97%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-89%</NUMEX>, and <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> conserved in the
          diagrams were independent of intron insertion sites (the
          null hypothesis). Intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were taken as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> immediately preceding the intron insertion. We
          also calculated nucleotide frequencies for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA site using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for numbering.
          Frequencies were calculated for alignments of all
          available fungal rRNAs (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1434</TIMEX> SSU and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">880</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> sequences)
          and of only fungi containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spliceosomal introns</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> SSU
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> sequences), or of fungi lacking spliceosomal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1361</TIMEX> sequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">840</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX>). These
          frequencies were used to determine the level of
          conservation of nucleotides encoding the proto-splice
          site in intron-containing and intron-less fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group II</ENAMEX>, and tRNA-like archaeal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> were
          marked on the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, which also accounted for multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I intron
          hits at the same rRNA site, were then studied to
          determine whether they differ significantly from the null
          expectation of a random distribution (i.e., "the broken
          stick distribution"). We used the program PowerNiche V1.0
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Drozd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Novotny</ENAMEX>, unpublished data) to generate
          sticks of length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1542</TIMEX> nt (SSU rRNA) or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2904</TIMEX> nt (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA)
          which were randomly broken by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> events for all introns
          (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II and archaeal), or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> for only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> for only spliceosomal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA, the stick was
          broken into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX> events for all introns, or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> for only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> for only spliceosomal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. The paucity of rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX> rRNA, respectively) and
          archaeal introns (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 and 6</NUMEX> introns in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU</ENAMEX>
          rRNA, respectively) did not allow their individual
          analysis. A mean number of intervals and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> were
          calculated for each broken-stick. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
          simulations were compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of the observed data
          to test whether the observed pattern was likely to have
          been produced under the assumptions of the broken-stick
          model.
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' Contributions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DS</ENAMEX> generated the new intron sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JH</ENAMEX> did the
        statistical analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-frequencies and information
        content. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JJC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRG</ENAMEX> established and maintain the CRW
        database and the rRNA-intron database, generated the rRNA
        G-frequencies and the yeast conservation diagram, and
        produced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3Dom and 3Dom2O</TIMEX> rRNA conservation data. DB
        conceived of the study, did the broken-stick analysis,
        participated in the design and coordination of the other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, and wrote the paper. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> read, modified,
        and approved the final manuscript.
