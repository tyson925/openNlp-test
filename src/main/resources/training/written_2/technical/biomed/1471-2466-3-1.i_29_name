        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human T</ENAMEX>-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with sporadic cases of chronic bronchiolitis and
        alveolitis, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with concurrent HTLV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> myelopathy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAM</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> type II
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>) has been epidemiologically associated with
        increased incidences of bronchitis and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Biological studies have demonstrated increased levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD3+/CD25</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , HTLV-I proviral load and
        HTLV-I tax/<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rex</ENAMEX> mRNA expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , HTLV-I specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interleukin-2 receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ,
        beta-chemokines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular</ENAMEX> adhesion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">molecule-1</ENAMEX> (ICAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , in bronchoalveolar lavage
        fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> for HTLV-I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p40</NUMEX> tax had lymphocytic infiltration
        of peribronchial and perivascular lung tissues associated
        with intrapulmonary expression of tax mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> myelopathy or uveitis had more
        pronounced biological changes, but some of these studies
        also found biological changes in the lungs of asymptomatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>.
        However, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> alters pulmonary
        function is unknown. Such information is important because
        the pathologic spectrum of these chronic human retroviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> has not been completely described. In addition,
        such information would be useful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who must
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> or treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> found to be HTLV-I or -II
        seropositive by serologic screening at the time of blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donation</ENAMEX>, military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, or as part of clinical care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use.
        We therefore performed standardized pulmonary function
        testing (PFT) on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I and HTLV-II</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        participating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV Outcomes Study</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOST</ENAMEX>), a
        prospective multicenter cohort study of the health outcomes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HTLV</ENAMEX> infection that was initiated as part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heart Lung and Blood Institute</ENAMEX> Retrovirus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology Donor Study</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study design and patient population
          The enrollment and follow-up procedures of the HOST
          have been described in detail elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In brief,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> found to be seropositive for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I and HTLV-II</ENAMEX>
          at the time of routine or autologous blood donation in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-1992</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> blood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> were
          eligible for enrollment. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I and HTLV-II</ENAMEX> infection
          status was confirmed with type-specific serology and/or
          polymerase chain reaction testing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> have been
          followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately every two years</TIMEX> with health
          history questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood
          testing. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third biennial</TIMEX> visit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-1997</TIMEX>, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">performed PFT</ENAMEX> on a randomly selected subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> and
          -II positive subjects at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">HOST</ENAMEX> centers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Red Cross Blood Services Southeastern Michigan</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Red Cross Blood Services Southern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, CA), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blood Centers</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, CA), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oklahoma Blood</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>, OK)). We also selected
          seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> by strata
          based upon the age, sex and racial distribution of the
          HTLV positive subjects, and asked them to undergo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFT</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFT Procedures</ENAMEX>
          In performing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFTs</ENAMEX>, we followed standards
          published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Thoracic Society</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Spirometers were calibrated according to these standards,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> forced expirations. We
          measured forced vital capacity (FVC) in liters, forced
          expiratory volume at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one second</TIMEX> (FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ), diffusing lung capacity corrected
          for hemoglobin (DLCO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> ) and diffusing lung capacity
          corrected for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation (DLCO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corr /VA</ENAMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX>'s best effort,
          as judged by the highest sum of vital capacity and FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> from among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> expiratory efforts,
          was used in the analysis.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          For each of the pulmonary function measures, means and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> confidence intervals were calculated. The mean
          of each parameter was compared between the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> and seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> tests (PROC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLM</ENAMEX>). Outcome variables, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FEV1</TIMEX>, DLCO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> and DLCO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corr /VA</ENAMEX> were all treated as
          continuous variables in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Multivariable analysis
          was performed using linear regression, adjusting for age
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">quartiles: ≤ 40</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41-47</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47-53 and 54</NUMEX>+), gender (male or
          female), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>/other), smoking history (nonsmokers, ex-smokers,
          and current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>) and weight (study population
          quartiles, ≤ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66 kg</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">67-78 kg</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">79-88.5 kg and ≥ 88.5 kg</NUMEX>).
          The model evaluated differences in pulmonary function
          parameters and their statistical significance when all
          important confounders, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, and
          characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were taken into
          consideration. Due to the limited number of subjects, we
          were unable to stratify the analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
          Nonetheless, power calculations revealed that the study
          was able to detect a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> percent difference compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seronegatives</ENAMEX> in the parameters measured with power (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX>
          beta) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.85</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.96</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-</ENAMEX>II. All analyses were done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> version
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.12</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>).
          For each of the pulmonary function measures, means and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> confidence intervals were calculated. The mean
          of each parameter was compared between the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> and seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> tests.
          Multivariable analysis, adjusted for age, gender,
          race/ethnicity, smoking history and weight, was performed
          using linear regression. Due to the limited number of
          subjects, we were unable to stratify the analysis by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Power calculations revealed that, relative to the
          seronegatives, the study was able to detect a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>
          decrease in the parameters measured with power (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - beta)
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.85</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.96</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-</ENAMEX>II.
          All analyses were done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.12</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Human Research</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, has
          approved the study.
        
      
      
        Results
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">258</NUMEX> subjects enrolled in the study, one
        subject had only one instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> expiratory efforts
        recorded. This subject was eliminated from further
        analysis, leaving a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX>; none had adult
        T-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> or HTLV associated myelopathy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were comparable to seronegative
        subjects with regard to age, gender and race/ethnicity,
        except that HTLV-I subjects were somewhat older, and more
        likely to be of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity and to be former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smokers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were of
        similar height, HTLV-I infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a
        non-significant trend toward lower body weight. Thirty-one
        percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>,
        compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 11 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> and seronegative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Dating from study enrollment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-92</TIMEX>, incident
        cases of medically-diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> or acute bronchitis
        were reported by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 percent</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 percent</NUMEX> of seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the
        current analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> proviral load were available from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> HTLV-I subjects (mean = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2.97</NUMEX>, standard error <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX>
        copies per PBMC) and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (mean =
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.46</NUMEX>, standard error <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX> copies per PBMC).
        Mean (standard deviation) pulmonary function values
        among all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.74</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.89</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>, FEV 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.93</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67</NUMEX>) L, DLCO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.89</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min/mmHg,</ENAMEX>
        alveolar ventilation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.25</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.20</NUMEX>) L and DLCO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corr /VA</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.54</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.87</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min/mmHg/L.</ENAMEX>
        These data were comparable to mean values for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and women
        combined reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National Health</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutrition Examination</ENAMEX> (NHANES I) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.82</NUMEX>, FEV 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.94</NUMEX> and DLCO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.605</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In our study, FVC
        and FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were also corrected for height squared
        (in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters</NUMEX>), yielding values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.34</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.24</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/m</ENAMEX> 2and 1.05
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.20</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/m 2</ENAMEX>, respectively. There was also no significant
        difference in small airway flow (FEF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-75</NUMEX> ) between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> infected and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seronegatives</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX>, data not shown).
        Figures 1through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4show</TIMEX> the raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulmonary</ENAMEX> function
        values, stratified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> status. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had
        slightly lower mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX>, FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and DLCO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> than did the seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        but no such difference was apparent for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.
        The results of the multivariable linear regression
        analysis are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. For both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> and FEV1
        adjusted for height squared, mean values were only
        minimally smaller for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and no different at
        all for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, both compared to HTLV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seronegatives</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corr</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had mean values
        that were about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent lower, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> group
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about five percent</NUMEX> lower, compared to seronegatives.
        However these differences narrowed after adjustment for
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounding</ENAMEX> variables and neither was
        statistically significant, although there was a trend
        toward lower adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCOcorr</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. DLCO
        corrected for alveolar ventilation (DLCO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corr /VA</ENAMEX>) showed no differences between
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and seronegatives in either the unadjusted
        or the multivariable analysis. Finally, there was no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCO</ENAMEX> and the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>
        proviral load among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> seropositives (data not
        shown).
      
      
        Discussion
        This study did not reveal significant differences
        between HTLV-I or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> infected and uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in
        pulmonary function or diffusing capacity, after adjustment
        for confounding variables. This normal pulmonary function
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are in contrast to previous reports of
        bronchio-alveolitis and differences in biological
        measurements in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX>-I infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Most previous reports of HTLV-I bronchio-alveolitis
        reported more frequent and severe pathological and
        biological abnormalities of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> myelopathy or uveitis compared to HTLV-I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> without apparent disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 8 14</NUMEX> ] . Since our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were without overt inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, we cannot
        comment on potential pulmonary function abnormalities in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with clinical inflammation. Likewise a rare case
        of bronchio-alveolitis among our study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> could have had
        pulmonary function abnormalities that were masked by our
        comparison of mean values among the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HTLV-I, HTLV-II</ENAMEX> and
        seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Finally, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> could have had
        clinical or subclinical pulmonary inflammation due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX> infection, but this inflammation was not
        of sufficient severity or duration to manifest measurable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decrements</ENAMEX> in overt pulmonary function.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the cohort study from which these subjects
        were drawn has revealed an increased incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        and acute bronchitis among <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>, and to a lesser degree
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>, infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Those results were based
        upon analyses of reported physician diagnoses of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illnesses</ENAMEX>, and were adjusted statistically to account for
        differences in socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> infected and uninfected
        subjects. Although we initially attributed these illnesses
        to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, we
        now propose the hypothesis that these diagnoses may have
        been due to immunological mechanisms as in cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX>
        bronchio-alveolitis. The negative results of current study,
        although reassuring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTLV-II</ENAMEX>
        infection, cannot exclude either of these hypotheses.
        Strengths of the current study include its setting in a
        well characterized cohort study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with laboratory
        confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I and HTLV-II</ENAMEX> infection, and the inclusion
        of an appropriate control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Due to information
        gathered in the cohort study, we were also able to control
        for other potential confounding variables such as cigarette
        smoking and alcohol intake. Weaknesses include moderate
        size of the study, which made us unable to detect PFT
        differences that were less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> percent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFT</ENAMEX>'s
        were done at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different sites, which could have
        resulted in increased variability of the results. The PFTs
        that we used may be insensitive to minor degrees of
        pulmonary damage, and with this cross-sectional data we may
        have missed a progressive loss of pulmonary function over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, this moderate size study did not reveal
        any statistically significant differences in pulmonary
        function between generally healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and comparable HTLV seronegatives. However it could
        not rule out subtle differences in lung inflammation that
        might lead to functional impairment over a longer follow-up
        period. Further studies of the immunologic characteristics
        of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HTLV-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-II</ENAMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are needed, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with a history of
        recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> or acute bronchitis but without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myelopathy</ENAMEX> or uveitis.
