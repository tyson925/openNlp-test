        Mounting concerns about drug-resistant pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] have rekindled interest in alternative
        treatments of bacterial infections. Prominent among these
        alternatives is phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to
        kill or otherwise control the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in
        infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. The use of bacteriophage for the treatment
        of bacterial infections is an old idea [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] that not only
        caught the imagination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] it
        was practiced with sporadic successes worldwide in the
        1920s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930s</TIMEX>. However, following the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, the use of phages to treat and
        prevent infections disappeared from so-called Western
        Medicine, but it did survive in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. A
        rekindled interest in phage therapy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>
        has inspired historical reviews, increased our awareness of
        a substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of phage therapy work from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , resulted in the West's "discovery" of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eliava Institute</ENAMEX> (a one-time vast and thriving phage
        therapy research and production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tiblisi</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ), and motivated the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
        developing phage therapy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biophage Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exponential Biotherapies Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Washington</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY; Intralytix</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> this
        renewed interest in phage therapy has been displayed in
        articles in the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>, (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kuchment 2001</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Superbug Killers, News Week</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 17, 2001</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-51</NUMEX>) and, of
        course, reviews and discussions on the internet,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evergreen</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/user/T4/PhageTherapy/Phagethea.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
        Renewed interest in phage therapy is also evident from
        recent empirical studies of phage therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] and theoretical excursions into the population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of phage therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . This rebirth has also
        revived attention to earlier experimental work on phage
        therapy and prophylaxis, including several impressive
        studies using phage to treat and prevent bacterial
        infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piglets</ENAMEX> and lambs by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.B Huggins</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The earliest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] is
        especially instructive in this light. Using experimental,
        lethal infections of an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">018:K1:H7</TIMEX> into the mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thigh</ENAMEX>, it showed: (i) phage were at least as effective as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> in preventing mouse mortality; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) not all
        phages were equally useful, rather those that required the
        K1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> for infection were superior to phages not
        requiring K1; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) survival declined with a delay in
        treatment, even though the treatment was applied well
        before untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had overt symptoms of the infection.
        Perhaps most importantly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] also
        provided information about the dynamics of phage treatment
        - the changes in bacterial and phage densities over the
        course of the infection. Ultimately, the efficacy of
        antibacterial therapy has to be measured by the rate at
        which it eliminates the symptoms of the infection.
        Microbiological data on the course of infections with and
        without treatment - the population dynamics of the
        treatment process - provide a means to understand how
        treatment operates and allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to compare, modify and
        improve therapeutic protocols.
        The present study is offered in the spirit of continuing
        the precedent set by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> for analyzing the
        population dynamics of phage and antibiotic therapy. We use
        their infection model to develop and illustrate the use of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quantitative methods that facilitate understanding,
        comparing and developing methods of antibacterial therapy
        and protocols for their application. One method provides a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facile</ENAMEX> measure of efficacy of treatment that is independent
        of the clinical outcome of infection and can be applied on
        a tissue- and time-specific basis for any form of treatment
        to which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can acquire resistance. The other method
        is a simple procedure to assay phage growth rate in vitro
        that can be used to screen phages to evaluate their
        potential for therapy.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huggin</ENAMEX>'s results are repeatable
          We repeated the experiments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. William Smith</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.N. Huggins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Despite the fact that we used
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">018:K1:H7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          phages, our treatment and mortality rate results were
          similar to theirs both qualitatively and quantitatively
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>):
          (a) All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> untreated/control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> died within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 hours</TIMEX>
          of inoculation with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB1</TIMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> survived when
          treated immediately with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ï†LH</NUMEX> (the phage requiring the
          bacterial K1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> for adsorption) or when treated
          immediately with a single dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/gm streptomycin.</ENAMEX>
          In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> survived when treated
          immediately with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ï†LW</NUMEX> (the phage that was not specific for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-capsule). These results closely match those of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , except that they did not
          report experiments of immediate treatment with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>.
          (b) Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with untreated infections
          normally survived <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 24 hours</TIMEX>, delaying treatment
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 8 hours</TIMEX> significantly reduced the rate of
          survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with a single dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼/gm</ENAMEX>
          and of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼/gm streptomycin.</ENAMEX> The survival rate of these
          streptomycin-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, however, significantly
          exceeded that of the controls and that which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] obtained with a single dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼/gm</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX>. The survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with Ï†LH was
          slightly reduced with delayed treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> survived, versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          with immediate treatment), a difference that is not
          statistically significant. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX>
          study, the decline in survival at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> was significant
          for the combined samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> isolates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific
          phages, but not for their most efficacious phage. We did
          not conduct delayed treatment experiments with Ï†LW or
          with multiple doses of streptomycin.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Resistance Competition Assay</ENAMEX> (RCA)
          
            Derivation
            The principle of this method is that, when a mixture
            of resistant and sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> is treated, the
            relative frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> resistant to treatment
            will increase at a rate according to efficacy of the
            treatment. That is, resistant cells increase relative
            to sensitive cells by the amount that treatment kills
            or inhibits sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The derivation of our
            measure of this efficacy of treatment, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> , follows from standard
            population genetics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of selection between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            haploid genotypes that different in their relative
            fitness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . (Following convention, we use
            italicised 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> for the parameter value or
            estimate, and normal font <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> for the assay procedure.)
            In this perspective, sensitive and resistant bacteria
            are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> competing genotypes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> estimates the
            relative fitness advantage (or disadvantage) of the
            resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> over sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In
            situations where one has the luxury of many sampling
            points, an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> can be calculated from the
            slope of the natural log of the ratio of the densities
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Resistant/Sensitive</ENAMEX> as a function of time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
            In situations where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> points are feasible, the
            initial frequency of resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in the inoculum
            ( 
            p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) and the frequency of resistant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at time t ( 
            p 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             ) an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> can be calculated from
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ln</ENAMEX> [( 
            p 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-</ENAMEX> 
            p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ))/( 
            p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-</ENAMEX> 
            p 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             ))]/t (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            (for the derivation see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimura</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
            ).
            The value of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> is the selection coefficient
            of resistant cells (in the vernacular of population
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX>). If 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> then the resistant
            cells have an advantage, if 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RCA < 0</ENAMEX>, the resistant cells
            are at a selective disadvantage. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> operates on an exponential
            scale:
            p 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t /</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-p 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = e t 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> (p 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 /</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
            If the differential success of sensitive and
            resistant cells is constant over time, then the ratio
            of resistant to sensitive cells increases by a factor
            of e 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">RCA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of t).
            Assuming that cells are not growing and that treatment
            kills sensitive cells, an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> means that sensitive
            cells are not killed, an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> means that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> of
            sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are killed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>),
            and an 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> means that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86.5%</NUMEX> of
            sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are killed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.8%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>).
            If the process is not constant, then the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> is an average over the
            interval of estimation and should not be projected to
            longer intervals; however, estimations of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> at different times would
            reveal how treatment efficacy is changing with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
            As an alternative to using the initial frequency of
            resistant cells as the estimate of 
            p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , one can substitute the final
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> ( 
            q 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             ) of resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in untreated controls (as
            was done here). This substitution controls for
            intrinsic differences in fitness of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
            for differences in the physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at the time of inoculation that could affect
            their growth rates independent of treatment, and for
            possible differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response with and
            without treatment. The resulting 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> is thus the advantage of
            resistant cells over sensitive cells relative to their
            advantage in the absent of treatment. For example, in
            the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> treatment, resistant bacteria
            may have a disadvantage in competition with sensitives
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and use of 
            q 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             in place of 
            p 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> will correct for this effect. It
            is important, however, that the controls from which 
            q 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             is obtained be inoculated with the same mix of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and be sampled at the same times as the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">treated mice</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Bacteria become refractory to phage and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>
            As noted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> in more detail in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX>
            ] , the survival rate from treatment with phage and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> declines dramatically with the term of
            infection. A declining efficacy of delayed treatment is
            also evident by comparing 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values for Ï†LH or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> for a single dose of
            streptomycin was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> after immediate treatment but
            declined to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> when treatment was delayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>. The
            corresponding values for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phage were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>. The 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> for Ï†LH at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> is
            statistically indistinguishable from that for immediate
            treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ï†LW</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX>), even though the mouse
            survival under these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions differs
            significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>). It is thus evident
            that by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> had declined in their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to phage, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> efficacy
            declined as well. It is noteworthy that there were no
            apparent clinical symptoms of these infections at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> (or even at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>).
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria inoculated</ENAMEX> into the thigh not only
            became refractory to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> and phage treatment
            within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> after inoculation, they persisted
            and remained refractory to phage treatment for a number
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> if the mouse survived. In samples taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>
            after treatment, the density of the Ï†LH phage in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thigh</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 9phage particles per gram</NUMEX>, and while phage
            resistant cells were present, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.81 Â± 0.01</NUMEX>) of the
            bacteria isolated from leg tissue remained sensitive to
            this phage.

          and here, as well as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values, indicate that phages
          specific for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-capsule are more effective in
          controlling the infections than phage that are not
          specific for the capsule. Could this have been
          anticipated from the in vitro capacity of the phage to
          replicate on and kill 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">018:K1:H7</TIMEX>? The Phage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Replication Assay</ENAMEX> (PRA) attempts to provide a measure of
          in vitro efficacy that can be extended to in vivo
          performance. The rate of doubling of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          lytic phage on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> measures the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> efficacy of that phage in killing those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. This overall replication rate depends on
          adsorption rate, latent period, and burst size on that
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, as well as temperature and other physical
          properties of the culture conditions (see Additional file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The rate of replication also depends on the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (the multiplicity of infection) and
          most critically on the density and physiological state of
          the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] ). Despite the many
          factors that influence phage replication rates (and hence
          influence the 
          PRA value), these factors are
          easily controlled, and furthermore, the comparison of 
          PRA s between different phages is
          straightforward if the 
          PRA s are obtained from common
          bacterial cultures (as here, see Methods).

          underlie the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phage Replication Assay</ENAMEX> (PRA), how assay
          conditions may violate those assumptions and affect those
          values estimated, and how to minimize the effect of
          violating those assumptions. A mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> using
          differential equations is provided to evaluate the
          magnitudes of some of these effects.

          Our 
          PRA values are surprising in some
          respects yet are consistent with the mouse mortalities
          and microbiological data. When the 
          PRA of these phage were estimated
          on cells grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luria Broth</ENAMEX>, there was no apparent
          difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phages (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>); the 
          PRA s were strongly affected by
          cell densities, but both phages showed similar patterns,
          and there is no basis from these in vitro data for
          suggesting any difference in their efficacy at
          replication on and killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CAB1</NUMEX>. Note that the observed 
          PRA s declined with increasing
          bacterial density, the opposite of the effect seen in the
          simulations of Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. There are in fact two
          opposing effects of cell density on the PRA. One is that
          higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> densities reduce phage generation time by
          decreasing the time for a phage to encounter a host. This
          increases the 
          PRA . The other is that high cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">densities</ENAMEX> exhaust nutrients in the media and thereby slow
          bacterial growth, in turn reducing phage metabolism and
          thus reducing the 
          PRA . Only the former effect was
          considered in the model of Additional file 1.
          When the 
          PRA was estimated on cells grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phage Ï†LH had a much higher
          rate of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">replication than Ï†LW</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Despite variance
          in the estimates, there was a pronounced superiority of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phage Ï†LH over the non-specific phage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ï†LW</ENAMEX>. Although this serum assay did not fully mimic in
          vivo growth conditions, it certainly supports the
          hypothesis that the greater treatment efficacy of Ï†LH is
          specific to phage replication on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and is
          not from a general superiority of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ï†LH</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Factors affecting treatment success
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> observations from these combined studies seem
          especially interesting. (i) Phages vary in treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) Delaying treatment by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> substantially
          increases the rate of mortality relative to that of
          immediate treatment (for many of the treatments applied
          here), despite the fact infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> survive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours longer</TIMEX>. In attempting to better understand these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, we developed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assays. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> assay, the RCA
          ( 
          R esistance 
          C ompetition 
          A ssay) measures the efficacy of a
          treatment in killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria
          based on changes in the frequency of treatment-resistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> after treatment is applied. The other assay, the
          PRA ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> hage 
          R eplication 
          A ssay), measures the ability of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX> to replicate on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of a bacterium under
          controlled, in vitro conditions.
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> and 
          PRA values reflect what is observed
          with other (microbiological) measures of the efficacy of
          treatment. Consider first the effect of delayed
          treatment, which reduced mouse survival in most
          treatments. Increased mortality with delayed treatment
          could have various causes: (i) By the time of treatment,
          the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are already sufficiently high
          that mortality is caused by toxins and tissue damage
          ensuing from them, rather than from further growth of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Under these conditions, reducing the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by treatment would have little effect on the
          clinical outcome of the infection. (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) By the time of
          treatment, the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are so high that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>'s defenses cannot prevent further growth of the
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, even with treatment, and bacterial
          numbers simply increase to the point of mortality. This
          model is similar to that in (i), except that a treatment
          which controlled bacterial growth would prevent
          mortality. (iii) As a consequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s response
          to the proliferating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the site of
          the infection becomes less accessible to the antibiotic
          or phages, and the proliferation of the bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> can no longer be controlled by these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">antibacterial</ENAMEX> treatments. (iv) The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> become
          physiologically refractory to the treatment.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> specifically supports the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models.
          If by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were as accessible and
          responsive to the phage or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> as they were
          initially, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values would remain high. We
          instead observed a drop in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values. The data do not rule
          out additional processes consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (i) or
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>), but the data clearly reveal a reduced bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> or reduced access of treatment to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> when treatment is delayed.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H. Eagle</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> observed a dramatic decline in the efficacy of
          antibiotics with the term of the infection in a mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">thigh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. In their now classical investigations of the
          within-host dynamics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> treatment, they
          followed the course of penicillin treatment of 
          Treponema pallidum and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> A and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group B Streptococcus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          postulated that the most likely reason for the declining
          efficacy of treatment with the term of the infection was
          due to (i) a decline in the rate of metabolism and
          replication of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> during the infection, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          that slowly growing or non-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are more
          refractory to penicillin than those that replicating at
          higher rates. More recent work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Tuomanen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Tomaz</ENAMEX>
          and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> supported this interpretation, a
          phenomenon they called phenotypic tolerance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ]
          . They also provided evidence that nutrient limitation
          was the cause of the decline in the rate of bacterial
          growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Not only do bacteria become increasingly
          refractory to the majority of antibiotics as their rate
          of growth declines, but they also adsorb to and replicate
          bacteriophage less efficiently [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 33</NUMEX> ] , as is evident
          from the 
          PRA values in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Thus the
          decline in the efficacy of phage and antibiotic therapy
          with delayed treatment in our experiments is plausibly
          attributed to a decline in the rate of replication of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K1</ENAMEX> once inside the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
          The other intriguing observation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> that we corroborated here is the consistent
          superiority of phages requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K1 antigen</ENAMEX> for
          infection, when measured as mouse survival. Our 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values showed a significant
          difference between the phages in vivo, suggesting that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phages replicate at a higher rate than
          the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phages inside the mouse. Yet although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> casually observed that their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-K1</ENAMEX>-specific phages were inferior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific
          phages at lysing cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grown in artificial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>, suggesting intrinsic differences between the
          phages more generally, our 
          PRA estimates indicated that there
          was no intrinsic difference between our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phages in
          artificial media. Instead 
          PRA differences were consistent
          with mouse survival and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> data only when the 
          PRA was measured on cells grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX>. Thus the 
          PRA enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to begin
          unravelling the environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of differences in
          phage growth in vivo.
          In this investigation, we used the mouse thigh
          infection model because of the many precedents for its
          use and because of its established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">repeatability</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> undergo such a profound
          change in susceptibility or accessibility to treatment in
          only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> raises the question of whether the mouse
          thigh infection <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of natural
          infections. This question is not necessarily answerable
          at present, but the results do highlight the fact that
          development of specific protocols and phages for
          treatment in any one experimental model may be inadequate
          for treatment of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> under field
          conditions.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Resistance Competition</ENAMEX> Assay
          The preceding discussion indicates that the resistance
          competition assay is consistent with other measures of
          phage performance in vivo and provides specific insights
          not easily obtained in other ways. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> has other
          virtues that make it useful for studying phage therapy
          and other forms of treatment. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) It is versatile. In
          addition to being used to study the population dynamics
          of phage and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> treatment in general, the RCA
          could be employed to design and evaluate the efficacy of
          different antibiotic treatment protocols. It can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to virtually any experimental model, such as
          enteric infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] or urinary tract infections
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> provides a more direct measure of
          the in vivo action of antibiotics (or other treatments)
          than estimates of the concentrations of these compounds
          in serum or in solid tissue. Moreover, the RCA protocol
          controls for the contribution of the host defenses as
          well as variety other factors that could influence the
          density of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in a particular tissue. Only the
          action of the treatment per se can account for the
          difference in the frequency of resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> between
          treated and untreated treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> is more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humane</ENAMEX> and offers greater statistical power (per animal)
          than "outcome" measures of the efficacy of treatment
          based on survival or other clinical indications. The fact
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> yields a continuous statistic, rather than a
          binary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, enables the use of standard statistical
          analyses in which meaningful comparisons can be made with
          as few as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> replicates per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> infecting specific
          tissues at specific times, even allowing multiple
          measures per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. However, individual tissues
          subjected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> must not have high levels of
          bacterial migration from other tissues over the course of
          treatment.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> is a sensitive and specific measure of
          treatment efficacy, and as such, will not correlate
          perfectly with other measures of treatment. To wit, our 
          RCA s were similar between delayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ï†LH</ENAMEX> treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX>) and immediate Ï†LW treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX>),
          even though mouse survival rates were significantly
          different between them (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).
          These discrepancies highlight the complexity of the
          infection process and the fact that different measures of
          infection dynamics capture different properties. Because
          our 
          RCA s were based on samples from
          the infected thigh, the values apply specifically to that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thigh</ENAMEX> and do not necessarily reflect the efficacy of
          treatment in other tissues that may influence host
          survival.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phage</ENAMEX> replication assay
          This method has a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> beyond that
          demonstrated here. If phage therapy is to be developed
          for particular infections, it would be useful to have an
          in vitro procedure to screen phages for their potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> in vivo. The diversity of phage is enormous. For
          example among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phage</ENAMEX> isolated from different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> or
          different plaques on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> B, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 32</NUMEX> distinct
          phage were found [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] (as measured by host range and/or
          restriction pattern). A far greater number of phage could
          certainly be isolated with a broader array of lawn
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and by sampling different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The
          implication is that it should be possible to isolate a
          substantial number of lytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phage</ENAMEX> capable of killing most
          strains of enteric and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, hence offering a
          compelling reason to pursue phage therapy as a solution
          to antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Screening many phages for their
          therapeutic potential in experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> would be a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>- and animal-consuming task. The PRA employed here
          could facilitate that screening. Our results suggest that
          phage performance in serum could be a sufficient
          indicator of in vivo performance, but there is no reason
          that this assay could not be performed in vitro with
          other modifications, such as solid tissues. Moreover, as
          suggested in a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , in vivo culture may
          selectively improve the capacity of a phage to replicate
          on and kill <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in a mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Prospects for phage therapy
          This is a methodological study to develop and
          experimentally evaluate procedures to measure the
          efficacy of antibacterial treatment and to screen
          bacteriophage for their therapeutic potential. Our
          purpose in performing these experiments and publishing
          these results is not to advocate the use of phages for
          the treatment of systemic infections. Nevertheless,
          because of the current novelty of and aspirations for
          phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics, it seems
          appropriate to acknowledge that our results and those of
          several other studies offer promise that phage therapy is
          highly repeatable, can be successful, and is thus worthy
          of further research for clinical practice. Moreover the
          use of phage for therapy and prophylaxis needn't be
          restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, as phage could obviously be used
          for these purposes in domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          There are, of course, a number of problems associated
          with the use of phage as an alternative to antibiotics.
          To us the most serious biological problem is a restricted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> range. Not only would one have to know the species
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> responsible for an infection, it would be
          necessary to know which phages can infect that strain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. These requirements are certainly inconsistent
          with current empiric therapy that uses broad spectrum
          antibiotics, which dominates how antibiotics are employed
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Commonly, it is
          not clear whether a bacterial infection is responsible
          for the symptoms being treated with antibiotics, much
          less the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, strain, and resistance profile of the
          bacteria responsible. On the other hand, there are
          situations, like epidemics, where this knowledge would be
          available. And as procedures to identify the bacteria
          responsible for symptomatic infections get better and
          more rapid, it soon may be quite easy to get this
          information from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. As a consequence of
          the ever increasing frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> resistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the range of antibiotics to which individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are resistant, and the limited number of targets
          to which current (and soon to be anticipated) antibiotics
          are directed, there is a pressing need to develop
          alternative methods of treating and preventing bacterial
          infections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phages</ENAMEX> certainly offer some of the most
          readily-available and promising alternatives.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX> and antibiotic therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] are repeatable and
        robust quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Using their
        almost invariably (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX>) lethal 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K1</ENAMEX> mouse thigh infection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, but with different strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        independently isolated phages and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, we obtained the
        same frequencies of treatment survival as they did. As they
        also observed, phages that required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K1</TIMEX> capsule for
        infection provided greater mouse protection than phages
        that did not require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">K1</NUMEX>. When treatment was administered
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the infection, both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX> specific phage
        and single doses of streptomycin completely prevented
        infection-induced mortality. If, however, treatment was
        delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX>, the rate of recovery with a single
        dose of streptomycin (the most effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> study) was reduced by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Resistance Competition Assay</ENAMEX> (RCA), one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        protocols developed here, uses the change in the frequency
        of a minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> resistant to the
        treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> as a measure of the efficacy of treatment in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>. Our 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> estimates from phage and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">streptomycin</ENAMEX> treatment of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K1</ENAMEX> infections in laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are consistent with mortality rates. With immediate
        treatment, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values for the streptomycin and
        K1-specific phages (which totally prevented mortality) were
        both substantially greater than that of the phage not
        specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K1</TIMEX> capsule (for which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> died). 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> values for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific phage
        and for single doses of streptomycin when treatment was
        delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> were substantially and significantly
        less than those estimated for immediate treatment. The RCA
        supports earlier observations that as time between
        infection and treatment increases, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> become
        increasingly refractory to treatment (e.g., because of
        changes in bacterial physiological and/or the host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">environment</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phage Replication Assay</ENAMEX> (PRA) provides a simple
        measure of the rate of replication (and host cell killing)
        of lytic phage under defined conditions. By varying those
        conditions, it is possible to identify factors that affect
        phage growth and hence their efficacy in killing the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Over a wide range of densities of bacteria
        growing in artificial medium, the estimated 
        PRA s were similar between the
        K1-specific and non-specific phages. Based on these
        estimates we would not have anticipated different
        efficacies of these phage in treating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> K1
        infections. On the other hand, the assay performed in mouse
        serum yielded substantially greater efficacy of the
        K1-specific phage, matching its superior performance in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The results of this investigation, like those of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> and others, support the potential of
        phage for treating bacterial infections and the development
        of experimental infection models to evaluate and optimize
        the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> as well as phage treatment
        protocols. Our results illustrate the value of exploring
        the dynamics of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> during treatment
        in the evaluation and design of treatment protocols
      
      
        Methods
        
          Culture and sampling medium and procedures
          In vitro, liquid cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and phage were
          grown and maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luria</ENAMEX> - Bertani <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> (LB),
          supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 gm/l</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Bacterial densities
          were estimated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> counts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petri</ENAMEX> dishes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">plates</NUMEX>) containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.75%</NUMEX> agar. Phage
          densities were estimated on these plates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml top
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7%</NUMEX>) agar containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LB glucose</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ul of an
          overnight culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9bacteria
          per ml). When needed, the bacterial and phage suspensions
          were serially diluted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.85%</NUMEX> saline or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB Glucose</ENAMEX>
          before plating. When rare (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX>),
          phage-resistant bacterial densities were estimated by
          plating with and without ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9phage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> in soft
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agar</ENAMEX>; when common, they were estimated by streaking
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> across high densities of phage on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>. A similar selective plating procedure was used to
          estimate the densities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> resistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bacteria</ENAMEX>
          The primary strain used in these experiments was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB1</TIMEX>,
          an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> of the same serotype as
          that used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">O18:K1:H7</TIMEX>), but
          isolated from a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . We also used a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TcR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kps-</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> chimera of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolate</ENAMEX>, designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB281</TIMEX>, that does not express the K1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Phage
          Phages were isolated from an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> sewage
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. An aliquot of liquid sewage from the
          inflow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was treated with chloroform to kill
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viruses</ENAMEX>. The chloroform-free
          supernatant was then enriched for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">018:K1:H7</TIMEX>-specific phage by
          adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of this suspension to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LB</ENAMEX> containing
          CAB1 (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 4 Ã— 10 7bacteria</NUMEX> per ml). These
          mixtures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and sewage were grown for a minimum
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>, mixed with chloroform, and centrifuged to
          remove debris. The vast majority of phages in these crude
          lysates were able to grow on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB281</TIMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAB1</ENAMEX>,
          hence were not K1-specific. To enrich for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific
          phage, the mixed lysate was incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAB281</ENAMEX> and
          treated with chloroform <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> later to abort
          infections. After removing the chloroform, the cycle was
          repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times. The phage were then plated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAB1</ENAMEX> and single plaques were patched onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> of
          CAB281. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaques</ENAMEX> isolated after this passage,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were from phage that grew on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB1</TIMEX> but not on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB281</TIMEX>,
          hence were presumed to be specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K1-capsule</TIMEX>.
          From these plates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone each of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-specific and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-K1</ENAMEX> specific phage was chosen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designated Ï†LH</ENAMEX> and Ï†LW,
          respectively.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phages</ENAMEX> were characterized morphologically and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecularly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> micrographs revealed that both had
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">B1</NUMEX> morphology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] similar to phage Î» but with a tail
          of hexagonal symmetry and a somewhat shorter head-tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connector than Î»</ENAMEX>. Whole genomes of both phages migrated
          in agarose gels at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 40 kb</TIMEX>; genomes of Ï†LH
          and Ï†LW were sensitive to 
          Xmn I digestion but showed
          different digestion patterns.
        
        
          In vivoexperiments
          All mouse experiments were conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory</ENAMEX>
          University using protocols approved by the Emory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Institutional Animal Care Committee</ENAMEX>. All of
          the 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments were performed
          with female, outbred, white (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlin Sprague</ENAMEX>)
          of from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 10 weeks of age</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22-30 grams</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were
          maintained in cages containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> or fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml tuberculin syringes, suspensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were
          injected into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse thigh</ENAMEX>. For treatment, phage
          lysates, pseudolysates (phage-free bacterial cultures
          treated with chloroform), saline or streptomycin sulfate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIGMAâ„¢</ENAMEX>) solutions were injected into the opposite thigh
          or a forelimb muscle. Although chloroform was absent from
          injected lysates and pseudolysates, no other attempts
          were made to refine these preparations. Except as noted,
          the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phage</ENAMEX> injected were each
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 8and</TIMEX> the total volume injected was
          normally <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 ml or less</NUMEX>. Following the initial
          inoculation, the infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were periodically
          observed (usually at intervals of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 12 hours</TIMEX>),
          with more frequent observations (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hour</TIMEX> intervals) made
          during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 28-40 hour</TIMEX> post infection period when
          mortality was anticipated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Infected mice</ENAMEX> surviving beyond
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> never succumbed to the infection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. In situations where the mouse's ataxic appearance
          indicated that death was imminent, the mouse was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euthanized</ENAMEX>.
          Samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and phage taken from leg muscle
          were maintained for a maximum of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> before
          being weighed and suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of saline and
          homogenized with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Tearorâ„¢.</ENAMEX> The densities of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and phage in these homogenates were estimated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diluting</ENAMEX> and plating.
        
        
          Resistance Competition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assay</ENAMEX> (RCA)
          This assay measures the efficacy of phage or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streptomycin</ENAMEX> in limiting replication by an infecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The principle
          underlying this assay is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> resistant to a
          treatment will increase in frequency over sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> only to the extent that the treatment is
          effective at killing or reducing the rate of growth of
          the sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The assay converts the advantage
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> into a measure of treatment efficacy. For
          this assay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were inoculated with mixtures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          8bacteria (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CAB1</NUMEX>) that were sensitive to the treatment
          (phage or antibiotics) along with low frequencies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were then treated with phage or streptomycin either
          immediately (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 hours</TIMEX>) or after a delay of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>, or
          were inoculated with sterile <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.85%</NUMEX> saline (controls). At
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 4</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4.5 hours</TIMEX> after treatment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacrificed</ENAMEX> and the relative frequencies resistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in the mixtures were estimated from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenized</ENAMEX> leg tissue. We applied this assay in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) By using different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for the immediate and
          delayed treatments or, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) by inoculating the same mouse
          in different hind limb thighs, with the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoculation</ENAMEX> delayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>, and treating the mouse
          immediately by inoculation of streptomycin, phage or
          saline into the musculature of a forelimb
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phage Replication Assay</ENAMEX> (PRA)
          This procedure estimates in vitro the potential
          therapeutic efficacy of phages. It simply measures the
          rate at which a phage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> increases in density
          (its rate of replication) when grown on a strain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> under prescribed, controlled conditions. Phage
          replication in vivo is presumed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral part of</ENAMEX>
          phage therapy success, so to the extent that replication
          in vitro mirrors replication in vivo, this assay should
          indicate which phages are the best choices for therapy.
          The rate of replication of Ï†LH and Ï†LW on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAB1</TIMEX> was
          measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assays</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> were
          conducted as follows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°</NUMEX> until reaching a specified density
          as measured by light scattering from a side-arm flask.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Glucose</ENAMEX> and calcium were not added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. Aliquots of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of the growing bacterial
          cultures were added to empty tubes along with the phage.
          The suspensions were grown for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr at which time
          chloroform was added. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assays</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX> were
          conducted similarly, except that the densities at the
          time the phage were added were determined by plating and
          thus could not be standardized between replicates. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were allowed to replicate in serum for at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> before addition of phage. Phage concentrations
          were determined at the beginning and end points to
          calculate a per-capita increase ratio, Ï; we then
          transformed this value to log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 (Ï</NUMEX>) to estimate of the number of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">doublings per hour</NUMEX> (see the Additional file 1for the
          sensitivity of this measure).
          Several precautions were taken to avoid biases and
          reduce the error in estimating Ï. Phage concentrations
          were maintained at low levels throughout the assay so
          that uninfected cells did not become limiting (the final
          phage density was never greater than the cell density,
          indicating that a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> remained uninfected
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the assay period</TIMEX>). To reduce sources of variance
          in growth rate extrinsic to the phages, growth rate
          assays of both phages were usually conducted
          simultaneously with aliquots of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> culture
          for both phages.
