        Regular use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory dugs (NSAIDs) has been consistently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with reduced risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , possibly due to NSAID-related
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin synthesis</ENAMEX>, enhancement of
        cellular immune response, or induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . A number of epidemiological studies have investigated
        the potential protective effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> with respect to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> sites. There is some evidence that regular and
        prolonged NSAID use is associated with reduced risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> of the esophagus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 9 10</NUMEX> ] stomach [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 9 11</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovary</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , and female breast [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Although there is a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of epidemiological
        evidence on the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> in the
        chemoprevention of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17 18 19 20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] ), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of these studies published to date
        were not specifically designed to investigate this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 21</NUMEX> ] . In a randomized trial aimed
        at examining the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in the prevention of
        cardiovascular disease in male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peto et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        ] first noted lower lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rates in the
        aspirin intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> subsequent cohort studies demonstrated associations
        with regular [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] or frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. In contrast, in a prospective analysis
        of the NHANES I follow-up study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schreinemachers</ENAMEX> &
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Everson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] reported lower incidence of lung cancer only
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> classified as recent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenberg</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] observed no strong evidence for a chemopreventive role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in a hospital-based case-control study; whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langman et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , in a record-based case-control
        study, reported a borderline significant risk reduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with frequent prescriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>. Most
        recently, results from a case-control study, nested within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYU Women's Health Study</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , indicated that women
        classified as regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> were at a marked, and
        statistically significant, reduced risk of non-small cell
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (NSCLC) compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> classified as
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>; however, no significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were
        observed for all histological types combined. Another
        recent case-control study investigated the effect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX> on lung cancer risk in a sample of heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . Results indicated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use was
        strongly associated with reduced risk; this effect was
        apparent for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. We conducted a
        hospital-based case-control study to further investigate
        the overall association between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and lung cancer
        risk, and to add to the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence on the
        potential effect modifying roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor histology</ENAMEX> and
        cigarette smoking on the chemopreventive role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who received
          medical services at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1998</TIMEX>, and who agreed to complete
          a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire. Informed
          consent was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The case
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">868</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with primary, incident
          lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, identified from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RPCI tumor registry</ENAMEX> and
          Diagnostic Index. Controls included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">935</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
          randomly selected from a pool of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7957</TIMEX> eligible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, who received medical services at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX> for
          non-neoplastic conditions. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> came to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX> with a suspicion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neoplastic disease</ENAMEX>, but were not
          diagnosed with either benign or malignant conditions. The
          most frequently utilized services among the controls were
          carried out in the breast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>), dermatology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>), gastrointestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sarcoma/melanoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>). The remaining controls
          were seen in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX>,
          including gynecological oncology, hematology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
          neck, radiotherapy, and urology; however the proportion
          of controls seen at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than five</NUMEX>
          percent of all control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Controls were
          frequency matched to cases on sex and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> age
          intervals.
        
        
          Questionnaire
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> completed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patient Epidemiology</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data System</ENAMEX> (PEDS) questionnaire, which is offered to all
          new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as part of the admission process, and is
          returned by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50 percent</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-page instrument covers information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption, family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
          occupational and environmental exposures, reproductive
          and medical histories, and diet. The instrument also
          assesses <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use relevant to the period prior to the
          onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Specifically, the instrument queried:
          'If you are currently ill, indicate how often you took
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>'. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          provided information on how many times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and for how
          many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> they took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> who reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use at least once a week for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> were
          classified as regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Dosage of use was
          assessed by comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who were classified as
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who reported that they had
          taken aspirin either one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week or seven</TIMEX>
          or more times per week. Duration of use was evaluated by
          comparing non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months to ten years or more than ten years</TIMEX>. We also
          evaluated a combined measure of dosage and duration by
          computing tablet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> per day × years of use).
          Reason for analgesic use was unavailable for these
          analyses.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          Descriptive analyses included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student t</ENAMEX>-tests of means
          for cases and controls for continuous variables, and chi
          square tests for categorical variables. Unconditional
          logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CIs). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> were
          adjusted for potential confounders, including age,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, and packyears of cigarettes smoked. Covariates
          were only included in the final regression model if they
          were established risk factors in these data or changed
          the observed risk estimates by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 15 percent</NUMEX>.
          Variables that were evaluated but not included in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multivariate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were occupational asbestos exposure,
          dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable intake, and family history of
          lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> classified as non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
          those who did not report to have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> at least
          once a week for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one year</TIMEX>) served as the referent
          category throughout the logistic regression analyses.
        
      
      
        Results
        Descriptive characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> are
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Due to the matching procedures, there
        were no differences between cases and controls with respect
        to age and sex. Cases were significantly less likely than
        controls to have obtained a college education (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). As expected, cases were more likely than controls
        to be former and current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), and to
        have had more packyears of cigarettes (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).

        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk in the total sample, as well as among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> separately. Compared to nonusers, regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use was associated with a significant reduction in
        risk of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the total study sample (adjusted OR
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.57</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.78</NUMEX>), as well as among female
        (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.29</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> (adjusted
        OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.62</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.90</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Higher dosage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>) was significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with risk in the total sample (adjusted OR =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX>) and among male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>). Prolonged duration
        of use (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 or more years</TIMEX>) was not associated with a
        significant reduction in risk in either the total sample,
        nor among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> defined by sex. However,
        self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one to 10 years</TIMEX> was associated
        with a significantly lower risk of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Among male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, there was evidence of a
        dose response relationship with lower risk as a function of
        longer duration of use (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). Risk of lung cancer
        was significantly reduced in relation to increasing tablet
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the total sample (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). We further explored these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> by
        restricting the sample to current and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, who
        were divided into tertiles of packyears of cigarettes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smoked</ENAMEX>. As can be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, risk estimates for the
        exposure categories described above were generally below
        the null among all smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However, statistically
        significant risk reductions and dose-response relationships
        were only observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the lower tertile of
        packyear distribution (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-34 packyears</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5displays</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and risk of

        were observed for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> (adjusted OR= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.62</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX>) and small cell lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (SCLC) (adjusted OR =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Results from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based case control study are
        largely consistent with the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence on
        the association between regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and lung cancer
        risk. All previous studies reported some evidence of
        reduced risk of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in relation to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> or
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . We observed a
        significant risk reduction among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> defined as
        regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> in the total sample, as well as among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> separately. Our data also demonstrated significant
        risk reductions associated with higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin doses</ENAMEX>,
        prolonged duration, and greater tablet years of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>
        use, although significant trends were largely restricted to
        male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. We further observed that, after
        restricting the analyses to current and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, the
        chemoprotective effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> was most apparent among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the lower tertile of the packyear
        distribution. Finally, when we explored this risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> among histological subtypes, significant risk
        reductions were apparent in when controls were compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCLC</ENAMEX>.
        Although our findings follow the general trend that has
        been demonstrated in previous investigations, some
        differences exist. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> cohort studies reported reduced risk
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ]
        , while we observed strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Another study did not demonstrate a risk
        reduction among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , whereas we consistently
        found non-significant risk estimates below unity for female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. In a recent report based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYU Women</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study, Akhmedkhanov et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] reported a
        significant risk reduction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and a more modest,
        non-significant decease in risk for all histological types
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>. Our data are partly in contrast to these
        results, in that we observed the most marked reduction for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCLC</ENAMEX>, but also a significant decrease in risk for all NSCLC
        subtypes combined.
        These discrepancies in results may be partly explained
        by differences in study designs across studies (i.e.,
        randomized trial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , cohort study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 18 19 22</NUMEX> ]
        case-control study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23</NUMEX> ] , or by the vast differences
        in exposure assessment, ranging from assignment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> vs. placebo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] over ever use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 days</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] to having had an NSAID prescription in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the past three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the proposed mechanisms for the chemopreventive
        properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> points to the
        observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> inhibit prostaglandin
        (PG)-endoperoxide synthase (cyclooxygenase) enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        , of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of similar enzymatic activity exist,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1 and COX-2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1</ENAMEX> is constitutively expressed and
        involved in homeostasis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is induced and
        involved in inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . There is evidence from
        laboratory studies to suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> pathway may be
        involved in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        reported significantly higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> in
        mouse lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> tissue compared to normal tissue. It has
        also been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> inhibited nitrosamine induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> carcinogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and it reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> enzyme
        levels in lung cancer cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Further support
        for a potential role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> in lung cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> comes from several investigations that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">demonstrated COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> in human lung tumors,
        specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">precursor lesions</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression was generally shown to be
        increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and to a much lesser extent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCLC</ENAMEX>, the
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in latter tumor type is difficult
        to determine, due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC
        tumors examined in these studies was very small.
        Several methodological issues should be considered in
        interpreting these results. As in all case-control studies,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> could have affected the validity of the current
        findings. Selection bias is likely to have occurred in this
        investigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient group</ENAMEX> was restricted
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were treated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX>, a large regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and are not likely to represent
        the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> region. However, it is unlikely that
        self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use would be different for RPCI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> controls might introduce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, due to the possibility that some controls were
        suffering from conditions that would make them more likely
        to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> . However, greater likelihood of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use
        in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would only have attenuated the true
        risk estimate, rather than produced spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>.
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> controls were selected from a large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with a wide variety of
        non-cancer diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, minimizing bias arising from
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overrepresentation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        characteristics that may be associated with the exposures.
        In fact, no significant differences with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>
        use were observed for the most common diagnostic categories
        among controls. Selection bias may have also been
        introduced due to the low participation rate in this study.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only about 50 percent</NUMEX> of eligible cases and controls agreed
        to complete the PEDS questionnaire. We have no way of
        ascertaining whether or not those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who refused
        to complete the instrument differed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with
        respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use. Nevertheless, previous studies that
        utilized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDS</ENAMEX> data base and faced the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methodological</ENAMEX> issue, consistently replicated established
        epidemiological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for a variety of cancer sites,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovary</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] , colon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , breast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] ,
        prostate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , and lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Recall bias is always a
        problem in case-control studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. However, in this
        investigation it may have been less of an issue, due to our
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> controls. Further, the questionnaire used
        in this investigation places no particular emphasis on any
        specific item. Thus, there is little reason to believe that
        cases were more motivated than controls to recall aspirin
        use. Exposure misclassification may also have affected our
        results, as we based our analyses on self-reported
        analgesic use and were not able to independently verify
        this information. Also, the questionnaire did not assess
        the specific doses of analgesic preparations, such as
        regular or extra-strength <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>. Further, we did not have
        detailed information on other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> may
        have taken and cannot rule out the possibility that cases
        may have been more likely to have taken preparations such
        as ibuprofen or prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, which would have
        resulted in an overestimated or entirely spurious results.
        However, we have no reason to believe that any of these
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of misclassification were differential in
        nature.
        In summary, in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based case-control study of
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, we observed consistent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and risk, particularly among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Although a
        number of epidemiological studies have produced fairly
        consistent results, none of these investigations has been
        specifically designed to address this research question.
        These suggestive findings need to be replicated by a
        well-designed pharmacoepidemiological study that
        incorporates the newly introduced NSAID preparations.
