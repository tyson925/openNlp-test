        Traditionally, the animal body cavity (coelom) has
        played a major role in interpretations of metazoan
        evolution, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (e.g., flatworms) lacking a coelom
        to those (e.g., nematodes) with a false coelom and finally
        to the bulk of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phyla</ENAMEX> having a true coelom
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . There has never been complete
        agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal phylogeny</ENAMEX> and classification, but most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have divided living coelomate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deuterostomes</ENAMEX> (echinoderms, hemichordates, urochordates,
        cephalochordates, and vertebrates) and protostomes
        (arthropods, annelids, mollusks, and other phyla) based on
        differences in early embryonic development. An analysis of
        small subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>) sequences challenged
        this arrangement by placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">acoelomate</ENAMEX> and pseudocoelomate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phyla</ENAMEX> in more derived positions among the protostomes, and
        in further defining a clade (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX>) of molting animals
        that includes arthropods and nematodes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . This
        "Ecdysozoa" hypothesis has influenced diverse fields [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        and interpretations of developmental evolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Since its publication, evidence has appeared both
        for and against this hypothesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        Knowing the branching order of the major animal lineages,
        especially those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> with fully sequenced genomes, is of
        importance to diverse fields such as medical genetics,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX>, neurobiology, paleontology, and astrobiology.
        With a genealogy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, it will be easier to determine
        the origins and inheritance of mutations, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, gene
        functions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible relationships of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> phyla
        are: (I) arthropods + vertebrates, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) arthropods +
        nematodes, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) nematodes + vertebrates. The first
        hypothesis corresponds to the traditional grouping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        For convenience, we will use these names in reference to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypotheses while recognizing that this study, by
        necessity, involves only a subset of all animal phyla. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> hypothesis will be referred to as "hypothesis III"
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To test each hypothesis, sequence alignments of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were assembled and subjected
        to a series of analyses designed to reveal biases that
        could result in an incorrect phylogeny.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Analyses of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> datasets using
        neighbor-joining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] show that most (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>) support
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> support
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypothesis III</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplemental Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-taxon
        analysis). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in which support for one of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hypotheses is significant (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>), the results
        are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>, respectively; for
        those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a highly significant (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>)
        topology, the results are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>, respectively. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> proteins showing significant
        support (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>) for a hypothesis other than Coelomata
        were reanalyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum
        likelihood; bootstrap values were not significant using
        other methods. Such divided results are typical of
        single-gene analyses because of limited information (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~400</ENAMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>), necessitating combined analysis. Coelomata
        was supported significantly (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> bootstrap confidence,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> probability = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>) when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 four</NUMEX>-taxon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein alignments</ENAMEX> were concatenated and analyzed using
        neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> inference (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Using the
        Shimodaira-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hasegawa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX>) test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , this maximum
        likelihood topology was significantly different from the
        alternative hypotheses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypothesis III</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). These results agree
        with earlier studies involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-36</NUMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] .
        To test the stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> to taxon sampling, we
        included new sequences of the planarian 
        Dugesia japonica (Phylum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platyhelminthes</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 five</NUMEX>-taxon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein alignments</ENAMEX> (
        Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-taxon analysis). The results,
        upon concatenation with this additional taxon, were
        unchanged (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> continued to be
        significantly supported (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> bootstrap support, posterior
        probability = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>) and the alternative hypotheses were both
        rejected using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX> test ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), although the
        relationships among the basal phyla (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nematoda</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platyhelminthes</ENAMEX>) could not be resolved.
        Another potential bias is the specific taxa included in
        an analysis. For example, the original support for
        Ecdysozoa was obtained only with a particular genus of
        nematode, 
        Trichinella, that had a short branch
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18S</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rRNA tree</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . To test this, phylogenies were
        constructed using different species of nematodes. The
        Coelomata hypothesis was significantly supported (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>
        bootstrap support, posterior probabilities = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>; Ecdysozoa
        rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX> test, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypothesis III</ENAMEX> rejected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX> test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.027</NUMEX>) using either a genus in
        a different order, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brugia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>), or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trichinella</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C,
        2D). To further address the possibility that these results
        could be biased by taxon sampling, we included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from all available phyla for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The results indicate that an increase in the number of taxa
        does not decrease single-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX>; in
        fact, the trend is the reverse (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Simulation</ENAMEX>
        studies have shown that incomplete taxon sampling does not
        increase topological errors, and that most error is caused
        by limited sequence data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        In the initial study defining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , rate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> was considered to be the major bias affecting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> position of nematodes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18S</TIMEX> rRNA gene,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> typically have long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> indicating an
        increased rate of sequence change. Other nuclear genes also
        show this pattern, but to a lesser degree [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Phylogenetic methods can accommodate moderate amounts of
        rate variation among lineages without producing an
        incorrect phylogeny [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However, if the rate of change
        is sufficiently large, longer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> in a phylogeny will
        sometimes attract one another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . If that happens, an
        ingroup <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> may move to a more basal
        position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. In analyses of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18S</NUMEX> rRNA gene,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> typically appear basal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">arthropods</NUMEX> +
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX>. Because the use of a short branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nematode</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trichinella</ENAMEX> ) resulted in a tree
        whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nematodes</ENAMEX> clustered with arthropods, the basal
        position of nematodes in typical 18S analyses has been
        interpreted as long-branch attraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        If nematodes cluster basally because of long-branch
        attraction, then the strongest support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> should
        be obtained with the slowest evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This was
        tested in an analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but
        the results were equivocal. Therefore, we tested this
        suggestion with our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-taxon data set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        ordered by rate of evolution. Rate orders were determined
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: (i) nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> length and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
        vertebrate-arthropod pairwise distance. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> proteins
        were grouped into concatenations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to increase statistical resolution. The results
        show support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> at all rate orders, but the
        support is significant with the slowest evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        regardless of rate measure or number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> combined
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Concatenations of slow evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also
        show compositional homogeneity (pairwise disparity index
        test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , suggesting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> position of the nematode results from true
        phylogenetic signal and not compositional bias. Support for
        Coelomata was weakest with the fastest evolving proteins
        (which also showed compositional heterogeneity), indicating
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coelomata</ENAMEX>, may be the result of a rate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, compositional bias, or other artifact.
        To ensure that this result was not affected by
        mutational saturation in our data set, the mean number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> per variable site was determined for each protein
        and averaged for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> groups of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ordered by
        evolutionary rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>). As predicted, variable sites in
        the faster evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed a higher number of
        variants than those in slow-evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We also
        examined the minimum number of nucleotide changes required
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where only the nematode sequence varied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>).
        Slow-evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed a smaller number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> changes required to alter amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity,
        while faster evolving proteins required more changes. Thus,
        the nematode sequences in the slow-evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> do not
        appear to be mutationally saturated.
        Finally, the affect of lineage-specific rate variation
        on support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelomata</ENAMEX> was tested with the use of
        relative rate tests. Presumably, the selective elimination
        of genes with long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> will increase statistical
        support for the correct topology. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-taxon data set were each subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        different relative rate tests [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>
        determined to be rate-constant at the typically applied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stringency</ENAMEX> level (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> significance), and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stringency</ENAMEX> levels (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% and 40%</NUMEX> significance) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concatenated</ENAMEX> and bootstrap support was determined using
        neighbor joining. The results of the two tests were
        similar. As stringency increased, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-83%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        rejected, and the relative nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> length (to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthropod</ENAMEX> and vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>) dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16% to 0%</NUMEX>.
        However, in all cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coelomata</ENAMEX> remained highly
        significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Thus, the suggestion that a basal
        position of nematodes is the result of long-branch
        attraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] can be rejected.
        Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proteins</ENAMEX> analyzed and bootstrap support for each
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table-SuppInfo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">doc</ENAMEX>
        The importance of knowing the branching order of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> is illustrated by the immediate and wide acceptance
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX> hypothesis and its use in tracing patterns
        of developmental evolution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 10</NUMEX> ] . However, in the
        initial analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">18S rRNA sequences</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , Ecdysozoa
        was statistically significant only when a paralinear
        distance method was used; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other methods did not yield
        significant bootstrap support. In that study, Ecdysozoa
        also was not significant, using any method, when the
        flatworm sequence was included [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Subsequent analyses
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18S</NUMEX> rRNA gene have been interpreted differently [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] , but none has yielded statistically significant
        results supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the molting
        cuticles of arthropods (chitin) and nematodes (collagen)
        are not homologous [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The significance of other
        morphological characteristics bearing on the position of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> continues to be debated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Besides the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18S</NUMEX> rRNA evidence, other genetic evidence
        for the grouping of nematodes and arthropods has come from
        qualitative interpretations of 
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-thymosin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        evolution. In the case of 
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, support comes from a
        single posterior gene sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Y75B8A.1</NUMEX>) of the nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> argued to have
        greater amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> similarity with a posterior 
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Priapulus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Unfortunately, the
        
        Hox homeodomain is a short (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> with many sequence differences between these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxa</ENAMEX>. Definition of "sequence signatures" is qualitative
        and has not been tested statistically. In a subsequent
        study of nematode posterior 
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> were
        unable to determine if the simple nematode 
        Hox cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is an
        ancestral or a derived condition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-thymosin</NUMEX>, a sequence signature also has
        been argued to support a grouping of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . However, it
        is a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> known to have paralogs within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, the
        position of introns differs between sequences from the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> other metazoan taxa were surveyed.
        In addition, knowing the presence or absence of a gene can
        be problematic without the complete genome sequence of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> (in this case, genomes were known only in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> ). Thus, although
        suggestive, it is too soon to judge the significance of
        this sequence signature. One difficulty with interpreting
        such qualitative evidence, including 
        Hox gene orthology, is that almost
        any pattern can be found in nature if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks. In other
        words, sequence signatures have not yet been surveyed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systematically</ENAMEX> and objectively. In contrast, sequence
        evidence from randomly selected genes, analyzed
        phylogenetically, provides a more unbiased database
        amenable to statistical analysis.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Although it is possible that a basal position of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> is the result of some unknown and widespread bias
        not yet identified, a simpler explanation is that the
        grouping of nematodes with arthropods is an artifact that
        arose from the analysis of a single gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>. The
        results presented here suggest caution in revising animal
        phylogeny from analyses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or sequence
        signatures. Although many other aspects of animal phylogeny
        remain unresolved, our results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">arthropods</NUMEX>) are genetically and evolutionarily closer to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humans</ENAMEX> (vertebrates) than to nematodes.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> from 
        Dugesia japonica [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] were used to
        search the public protein database (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entrez</ENAMEX>) for orthologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis
        elegans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> thaliana, Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae, and 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe. When
        available, sequences from other major animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phyla</ENAMEX> (e.g.,
        Mollusca, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echinodermata, Annelida</ENAMEX>) also were obtained. In
        addition, the database was searched for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other nematodes, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brugia</ENAMEX> and 
        Trichinella, with orthologs in 
        Drosophila, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo</ENAMEX>, and 
        Arabidopsis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX>, or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schizosaccharomyces</ENAMEX>. Arabidopsis was
        used as the primary outgroup (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-taxon analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-taxon analysis, all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brugia</ENAMEX> and 
        Trichinella analyses); <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> was used
        as the outgroup when 
        Arabidopsis sequences were
        unavailable or paralogous. This was because many more genes
        were available for rooting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> than with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kingdoms</ENAMEX> are about equidistant from each
        other in terms of branch lengths [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and therefore a
        plant serves about equally well for rooting an animal
        phylogeny as does a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>. Orthology was assessed using
        reciprocal BLAST searches of the public protein database;
        those sequences receiving high scores in each search were
        also analyzed phylogenetically to ensure orthology. Short
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) sequences were omitted.
        Sequences were aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X [ 28</ENAMEX> ] and each
        alignment was visually inspected. Primary analyses of
        aligned protein data sets were conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MEGA2</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Phylogenies were reconstructed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        ] under a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> correction and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma distance (α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
        or estimated from the data for combined analyses), with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> replications) for all analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gamma</ENAMEX>
        parameters were estimated from the combined data using
        maximum likelihood under a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> correction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-taxon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.62</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-taxon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.94</NUMEX>, 
        Brugia, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>; 
        Trichinella, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>). In addition,
        phylogenetic analyses were conducted with maximum
        likelihood (JTT-F option) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and maximum parsimony
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Max-Mini Branch & Bound</ENAMEX> option) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] on combined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets; in all cases they resulted in similar results
        (topology and significance) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining
        analyses. Posterior probabilities of concatenated files
        were computed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> inference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> model
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> estimated from data; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>; 4
        chains with temp = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimodaira-Hasegawa</ENAMEX> tests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        were performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAML</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] (JTT-F option, fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>);
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-values for each topology were recorded.
        Rate constancy was assessed using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] under increasing stringency (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> significance
        levels); <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values were recorded for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-test
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] was also used under increasing stringency; z-values
        were recorded for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX> determined to be
        rate constant at different significance levels were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concatenated</ENAMEX> and analyzed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MEGA2</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Nematode
        position and evolutionary distance were determined for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concatenation</ENAMEX>. New sequences, accession numbers of
