        A synthetic form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant EPO</ENAMEX>, has been
        successfully used to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Some randomized trials (RCT)
        assessed the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in anemia related the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX>
        ] . However, many of these trials were underpowered and
        failed to identify clinically meaningful benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>
        treatment. As a result, there has been persistent
        uncertainty about the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> as a treatment for
        cancer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, despite the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in a
        clinical practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a decade ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Systematic</ENAMEX> reviews
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX>) are the best way to offer synthesis of evidence and
        are of special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in settings where many small trials
        fail to achieve a significant result [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        A recent comprehensive SR [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] addressed the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in treatment-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia in cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This SR
        included non-randomized studies and performed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> RCTs showing a significant effect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in reducing the need to transfuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are
        receiving chemotherapy. Although comprehensive, some issues
        were not addressed in this previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR/MA</ENAMEX>: a formal
        quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) was not performed
        according to different clinical aspects and to main
        methodological quality dimensions empirically linked to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        In contrast to this previous report [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] , in this SR
        we evaluated only data from randomized studies. We also
        investigated a broad range of clinical issues, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> use according to the level of hemoglobin (hb),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platinum</ENAMEX>-based chemotherapy and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor type</ENAMEX>. Finally, to
        investigate the stability of our conclusions, a broad
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">methodological</TIMEX> appraisal of the quality of the trials was
        performed, specifically examining those dimensions that
        have been empirically linked to bias [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        We also performed a conservative cumulative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis (CMA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] to determine the earliest point
        in time when the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> versus placebo reached a such
        statistical significance after which the uncertainty [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        about the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in cancer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> could have
        been considered resolved.
      
      
        Methods
        A previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SR</ENAMEX> served as a basis for location of the
        articles of interest [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . We also performed a search of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LILACS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CANCERLIT</ENAMEX> databases, last update in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July of 2001</TIMEX>, using the optimal search strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> for
        use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LILACS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] with the additional
        terms related to this review - (epoetin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR Erythropoietin</ENAMEX>)
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer OR neoplasm</ENAMEX>), in all fields.
        We included only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> that compared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> versus no
        therapy or placebo in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer related anemia</ENAMEX>. We excluded
        studies related to transplant setting and myelodysplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, since the physiopathology of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is
        different, more linked to pancytopenia than to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . We also excluded trials that used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> with the primary
        objective to magnify hb to improve the efficacy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiotherapy</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> trials described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> comparison of
        different doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> with only one control group [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . We approached these multi-arm studies in two
        different ways: in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was compared to
        the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> we combined all active arms
        in one, by adding all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and analyzed it
        against the control. Both combinations achieved virtually
        the same result and data are presented using the second
        method.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were abstracted on patient characteristics, type of
        tumor, treatment details and the major methodological
        quality dimensions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7</NUMEX> ] (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The end
        point studied was the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfusions</ENAMEX>. Results in a conventional meta-analysis were
        pooled using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Odds Ratio</ENAMEX> (OR) and relative risk
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX>), both in a fixed effect model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . We also
        extracted data on adverse effects of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>.

        Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>
        test (chi). The possibility of publication bias was
        assessed using the funnel plot method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . To assess
        the reasons for any heterogeneity found, we performed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta-regression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> and subgroup analyses
        according to the main methodological quality dimensions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] and a number of clinical criteria were also performed
        (see fig 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The results were calculated with
        corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>). When the
        results from pooled data were significant, we calculated
        the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> need to treat (NNT) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] in order
        to prevent one transfusion. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are
        advised to exercise due caution because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> (number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to harm) are more influenced by the baseline
        risk in a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than the odds ratio.
        The qualitative conclusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> was assessed
        using the method described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilberts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colditz</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX>
        ] and adapted to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> point scale, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> = control group
        highly preferred, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = control preferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        = about equal, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> a disappointment, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = about equal, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> preferred to control and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 = EPO</ENAMEX> highly
        preferred.
        Finally, we performed a cumulative meta-analysis (CMA) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] using a conservative approach, setting the α error at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tailored "p" in a random effects model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX> allowed us to determine the point when the
        results achieved a level of statistical significance after
        which we should expect no changes in the effect by
        performing new trials, and after which placebo controlled
        trials should not have been performed. In other words: CMA
        allowed us to determine the threshold point after which
        uncertainty about this question should have been considered
        resolved [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> randomized articles addressing the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer related anemia</ENAMEX> were located and retrieved for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> text appraisal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> fit our inclusion
        criteria. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> articles describing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small trials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX>
        ] with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were excluded from our
        analysis because they did not provide information regarding
        our end point of interest.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteen</ENAMEX> articles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 12 13 14 15 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] describing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> trials (see Additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">file 1</ENAMEX>) fit our inclusion criteria. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> paper [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different trials, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 26</NUMEX> ]
        were reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, in separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. We included data
        from these latest papers only. Therefore, we included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        trials from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> articles with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1896</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in cancer
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> trials with a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1511</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> described the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hb level
        < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> trials with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">369</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hb</ENAMEX> level >= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX>. Of the latter ones, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hb</ENAMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.6</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.0</NUMEX>
        g/dl. The analysis did not change when we excluded this
        trial in the sensitivity analysis.
        The possibility of publication bias was considered
        unlikely according to the visual inspection of the funnel
        plot [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The results of the critical appraisal
        according to the most important methodological quality
        dimensions of each article are shown in (see Additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">file 1</ENAMEX>). No single trial met all methodological quality
        criteria. All trials scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colditz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] scales, denoting strong
        qualitative support in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> ((see Additional file
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)).
        The meta-analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> trials (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1and 3</ENAMEX>) showed a
        significant beneficial effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in diminishing the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring transfusion [OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00001</NUMEX>], without statistical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> [chi = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.46</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>]. When we
        used relative risk (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 3</ENAMEX>) as a summary point estimate in
        the meta-analysis, the results remained significant [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.61</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00001</NUMEX>], but now with
        significant statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heterogeneity</ENAMEX>: [chi = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37.56</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0044</NUMEX>]. However, when the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porter et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] was removed from the analysis, heterogeneity
        disappeared from the analysis, and the analysis according
        to OR or RR did not differ. This is likely because in this
        small study including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, event rate
        was so high with all but one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> receiving
        transfusion.
        To further explain heterogeneity, we also performed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaregression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The variables related to the design
        and clinical features which possible could affect the
        treatment effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> were entered in the equation (see
        Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) We found no statistically significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between any of the variables with the treatment
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> when all data were simultaneously entered in
        a multiregression equation(data not shown). However, when a
        stepwise regression model was used, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables emerged
        of the potential significance which could explain most the
        heterogeneity of our results: (in)adequacy of allocation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concealment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.026</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb</ENAMEX> cut-off value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX> g/dl
        (p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.046</NUMEX>). The between study variation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tau2</TIMEX> estimate)
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0372</NUMEX> for the model containing no variables (i.e. the
        simple meta-analysis); this was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost zero</NUMEX> in
        the final model. In addition, most likely explanation of
        heterogeneity seen in our study is related to a small
        sample size of the individual trials resulting in random
        fluctuation of the effect between the studies. When we
        divided the trials according to the hb level, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX>
        g/dl as a cut-off point, the results remained essentially
        unchanged (i.e. highly significant in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>) (fig
        2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Thus, it appears that the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> is a rather
        robust despite heterogeneity noted in the meta-analysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> and subgroup analyses according to clinical
        and methodological quality dimensions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2and 3</ENAMEX>) showed
        consistency in the results, favoring the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>.
        Statistical heterogeneity was noted for some of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (see fig 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It was related to the
        magnitude of the treatment effect and not to its
        significance, since in all trials the point estimate of the
        effect favored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>. A stepwise metaregression analysis did
        point to the possibility that treatment effect could have
        been exaggerated by inadequacy in allocation concealment
        and that larger treatment effects are seen at hb level <
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11.5 g/dl.</ENAMEX> The heterogeneity was more common when we used
        RR than when we used OR.
        The overall result by pooling all trials indicates that
        for each 5 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 7</NUMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>, one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> will avoid transfusion. This result is maintained
        when we separately analyzed the trials that included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hb level < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb > 11.5 g/dl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 9</NUMEX>).
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> should be analyzed carefully, since they were
        calculated from a pool of data that in some analysis were
        not homogeneous.
        We also performed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>) using a conservative
        approach (i.e. setting α error at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>). Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CMA</ENAMEX> demonstrated
        that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> a high level of significance [OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0068</NUMEX>]; [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.53</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.90</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0003</NUMEX>] about the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> on reducing
        the use of blood transfusions had been achieved. Beyond
        this point, all new trials only improved the precision,
        without adding any additional useful information. We
        estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of the total
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who participated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> studies,
        were enrolled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> placebo-controlled randomized studies
        that were reported after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
        The previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] concluded that it was impossible
        to reasonably distinguish between adverse events related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> and concurrent treatments. We also tried to extract
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on adverse events, but were unable to make a
        reasonable approach due to the poor reporting. Therefore,
        we decided not to tabulate data on adverse events and
        perform quantitative pooling.
      
      
        Discussion
        According to our overall analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX>
        is related to an average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> reduction in odds of requiring
        a transfusion. A previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] pooled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> trials that
        used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous EPO</ENAMEX> (all also included in our analysis)
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian MA</ENAMEX> reached results similar [OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>] to ours. We could also demonstrate
        consistency of the results when analyzed according to OR,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX>, various quality dimensions and many different clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2and 3</ENAMEX>).
        Due to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> effects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are
        expected to have direct benefits through fewer transfusions
        and lower exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> effects. Furthermore, all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will benefit indirectly through conservation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> supply.
        The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> as summary statistics is less robust than
        OR [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and in this case resulted in greater heterogeneity
        than the analysis based on OR (see fig 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
        estimate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EPO</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> indicated a smaller
        effect than OR but both results were significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX> in both analysis). However, when events are common,
        the OR may overestimate the effect of treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Due
        to these characteristics of the analysis, we choose to show
        both (OR and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX>) as a summary statistics. Nevertheless, we
        should mention (see the RESULTS) that the most of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> could be explained by high transfusion rates
        in the trial by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porter et al.</ENAMEX> and inadequacy of allocation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concealment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> trials. Similarly, it appears that the
        larger treatment effects are seen when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EPO</ENAMEX> is given in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hb <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">> 11.5 g/dl.</ENAMEX>
        Because it was not possible to extract data on quality
        of life (QOL), this issue was not addressed here. However,
        a recent systematic review by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bottomley et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        indicated that solid evidence about the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> on
        this end point is lacking. We should also mention that the
        high cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> has deterred its widespread acceptance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] and more studies using economic analysis should be done
        to address the issue if the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> is
        cost-effective.
        A previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] found no increased incidence of
        adverse events of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> when compared with controls. We also
        did not find any side effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> consistently reported
        among trials.
        Our main goal here is to stress that the basic ethical
        requirement to randomize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in clinical trials is
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> must not have preferences for
        any of the therapies considered i.e. they should be in the
        state of uncertainty or equipoise [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . If uncertainty
        does not exist, it is felt to be unethical to ask patients
        to participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        To assess if uncertainty regarding a clinical question
        exists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> should evaluate the totality of
        pre-existing knowledge: if we already knew that one
        treatment is superior to another, nothing new could be
        learned and we would unnecessarily expose our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
        already known inferior treatment by performing a new trial.
        We showed here that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR/CMA</ENAMEX> had been used to formally
        address the uncertainty regarding the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, this uncertainty could have been
        conservatively considered resolved (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>) since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Our
        findings suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included
        in this SR participated in placebo controlled clinical
        trials that were reported after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> was shown to be
        superior to placebo. Had a CMA been performed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prospectively</ENAMEX>, it is possible that clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trialists</ENAMEX> may
        have decided against initiating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> clinical trials. We
        should note that we analyzed trials according to date of
        their report. It is conceivable that some trials were
        initiated before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, but were reported after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
        However, this only means that the uncertainty about the
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> could have been solved even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (if these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were available for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX> or a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX>). For
        example, if all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">656</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in randomized studies
        up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> had participated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>, large, randomized
        study, the uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> could have been solved
        earlier. An alternative approach to large studies in
        solving uncertainty is to use CMA to monitor accumulation
        of treatment effects in clinical trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The
        technique of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX> is a powerful scientific instrument to
        assess the significance of accumulated knowledge [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 38</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMA</ENAMEX> performed, there has never been a
        single case where the point estimate switched to indicate
        the opposite effect, once the difference between treatments
        reached statistical significance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPO</ENAMEX> is highly effective for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer-related anemia</ENAMEX>. This
        effect could have been detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX> had been
        performed at that time. The techniques of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMA</ENAMEX> should be
        used more frequently in the future to preserve "the
        uncertainty principle" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        consent to be randomized in clinical trials.
