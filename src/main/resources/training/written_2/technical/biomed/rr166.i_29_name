        The concept of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> as effector cells in the
        pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has
        recently evolved [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung</ENAMEX> fibroblasts respond, 
        in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines
        by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in
        fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix
        deposition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . In addition, activated lung
        fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of
        inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, 
        in vitro , and hence, these cells may
        also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic
        factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> act simultaneously as effector and target
        cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating
        the fibrotic process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Prostanoids are important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of fibroblast
        function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prostaglandin</ENAMEX> (PG)E 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is thought to have antifibrotic
        properties 
        in vitro , but also can have
        proinflammatory effects both 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Thromboxane
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>)A 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> increases proliferation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX> in several cell types, including fibroblasts
        and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Conversely, prostacyclin (PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) decreases smooth muscle cell
        proliferation and collagen synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types, including lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclooxygenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>), a proximal enzyme in prostanoid
        production, and can generate prostanoids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . It has
        been previously reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">decreased COX-2</ENAMEX> expression compared to normal lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and, hence, have decreased PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Because of
        these findings and the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> are important
        fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, we sought to investigate whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression could be associated with
        an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX>. We hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> (HF-IPF) have an altered PG balance
        compared to normal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (HF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>). This
        phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in
        the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Primary lung fibroblasts
          Fibroblasts from the lungs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>)
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> (HF-IPF) were harvested: a) from excised lung at
          the time of lung transplantation; b) during an autopsy
          performed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> from death; or c) during open or
          transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had advanced lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosis</ENAMEX> and were receiving prednisone ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were at an earlier
          stage of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and were not receiving
          immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The mean age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43-71</NUMEX>)]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-NL</ENAMEX> were cultured from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> human
          lungs that arrived at our transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with the
          intention of being used for transplantation, but for
          various reasons could not be transplanted; these were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macroscopically</ENAMEX> and microscopically normal. The cells
          were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described
          by Kumar 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, lung
          tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and
          incubated with serum free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin</ENAMEX>, DNAse
          and collagenase for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The procedure was repeated
          twice, and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 100</NUMEX> mm plate and incubated at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> humidified atmosphere. Culture
          medium (DMEM with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">penicillin/streptomycin</ENAMEX>) was replaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times per
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> and fibroblasts were passed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> split) at the time
          they became confluent. On passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> the cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and
          frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX>. For each experiment described below the
          cells were thawed, cultured and passed at least once. All
          the experiments were conducted with cells at passages 6
          to 8.
        
        
          Inducible cyclooxygenase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>)-2 expression and
          eicosanoid production
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> activity was determined by measuring PGE 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 , 6-keto-PGF</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX> (stable PGI 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 metabolite</TIMEX>), TXB 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (stable TXA 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 metabolite</TIMEX>), and PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2α</NUMEX> production in stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-IPF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-NL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were
          brought to ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> confluency in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100mm</TIMEX> plates and then
          placed on serum free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> to render them
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quiescent</ENAMEX>. Fibroblasts were then incubated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> alone or in the same medium with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml)
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the incubation period</TIMEX> the
          supernatant was aspirated and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          μM of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arachidonic acid</ENAMEX> was added to the plates. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> eicosanoid analysis. The cells were
          then resuspended and divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> aliquots, which
          were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extractions</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          The above experiments were repeated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-IPF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-NL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) using serum free media conditions.
          Prostanoids were measured by modified stable isotope
          dilution assays that used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> chromatography-negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX>-chemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deuterium</ENAMEX>-labeled internal
          standards of PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2α</NUMEX> , TXB 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">keto</NUMEX>-PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX> were added to the supernatants with
          isopropyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. Isopropyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> was removed by
          evaporation under nitrogen. After acidification to pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>, the samples were extracted on preconditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-18</ENAMEX>
          PrepSep columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fair Lawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>), and
          eluted with ethyl acetate. The extract was then converted
          to a pentafluorobenzyl ester by treatment with a mixture
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX> pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and
          disopropylethylamine at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min.
          After evaporation of reagents, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> was subjected
          to TLC plates, using the solvent system
          chloroform/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, vol/vol</ENAMEX>) for PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2α</NUMEX> and TXB 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ethyl acetate</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vol/vol</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">keto</NUMEX>-PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX> and PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Then PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2α</NUMEX> was converted to trimethylsilyl
          ether derivative by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-bis
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trimethylsilyl</NUMEX>) trifluoroacetamide and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimethylformamide</ENAMEX>. The methoxime derivative of TXB 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">keto</NUMEX>-PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX> was made by treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX>,
          followed by evaporation of the pyridine, addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and extraction with ethyl acetate. Derivatization
          was completed by formation of the trimethylsilyl
          derivatives by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-bis</ENAMEX> (trimethylsilyl)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trifluoroacetamide</ENAMEX> and pyridine. Eicosanoids were
          quantified by measuring the ratio of the intensity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ions m/z 569/573</ENAMEX> for PGF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2α , m/z 614/618</ENAMEX> for TXB 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">keto</NUMEX>-PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/z 524/528</ENAMEX> for PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . An analytical blank for each of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> was determined by measuring the amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nondeuterated</ENAMEX> material, detected after extracting and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">analyzing 2</ENAMEX> ml of saline to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deuterium</ENAMEX>-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> standards had been added.
        
        
          Western analysis
          After washing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were lyzed

          showed minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in unstimulated cells and

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> production, including mitogenic cytokines (e.g.,
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor β</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>], platelet-derived
        growth factor [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX>], basic fibroblast growth factor
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bFGF</ENAMEX>]), eicosanoids (i.e., PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , TXB 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), and antifibrogenic cytokines (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-γ</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . It is very likely that a complex
        interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair
        process, and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis, as in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>, results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts
        that affect the "normal" interaction of these factors.
        Our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of
        human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> with the proximal cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX>
        upregulates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA expression to a similar
        degree in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> fibroblasts. TXA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production tended to be greater in IPF
        than in normal fibroblasts at baseline; when stimulated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> this difference became statistically
        significant. The ratio of PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to TXA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> metabolites was lower in IPF
        fibroblasts at baseline and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> stimulation. The
        above results suggest that a decreased PGI 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 :TXA</TIMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio could be a phenotypic alteration
        present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> fibroblasts, resulting in a loss of their
        capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> production.
        The effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> on cell proliferation and collagen
        production have been widely studied in different cell types
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 26</NUMEX> ] . TXA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has been studied extensively because
        of its apparent role in atherosclerosis, due to its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prothrombotic</ENAMEX> and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth
        muscle cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . These mitogenic effects are
        potentiated by growth factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 27 28</NUMEX> ] . In vascular
        smooth muscle cells TXA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> stimulates synthesis of bFGF and
        increases the expression of the proto-oncogenes 
        c-fos , 
        c-myc , and 
        egr-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , which are associated with
        entry into the cell growth cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In addition, TXA 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> increases proliferation of fibroblasts
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and smooth muscle-like glomerular mesangial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] .
        On the other hand, PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> decreases vascular smooth muscle cell
        proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, via activation of adenylyl cyclase and
        subsequent production of cAMP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Betaprost, an analog
        of PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , decreases procollagen I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> mRNA
        expression in cardiac fibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . These effects
        may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and it is possible that an alteration
        of a "normal" physiologic balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGI</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and TXA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could increase tendency towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrogenesis</ENAMEX>.
        It is important to mention that our experiments were
        conducted at similar passage levels (passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 8</TIMEX>) in
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, since senescence of fibroblasts is associated
        with a shift from the biosynthesis of PGI 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to TXA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . It is possible that the
        difference seen in our study between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-IPF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-NL</ENAMEX> could
        result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages. HF-IPF
        might have been harvested from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibrotic lesions</ENAMEX> where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> had previously undergone a greater number of
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> than HF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>, obtained from nonfibrotic lungs.
        Although this is a possibility, the age-related shift in PG
        production has only been shown at very high cell passages
        and has not been documented 
        in vivo .
        We also found that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-IPF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-NL</ENAMEX> had similar PGE
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production at baseline, and a similar
        increase when stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>. PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can decrease fibroblast proliferation
        and collagen synthesis, and increase collagen degradation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Recent reports suggesting decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression and
        PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> have
        received significant attention [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 20 21</NUMEX> ] . In our study
        we found that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 protein</ENAMEX> expression and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production were upregulated to a
        similar degree in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> and normal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. We
        believe that differences in methodology and patient
        selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancheri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-α-stimulated fibrotic lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> had decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production, but they further showed
        that these findings were a result of decreased expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-α receptors</ENAMEX>. The latter finding would argue against
        a primary defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression, since no other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX>, other than TNF-α, was tested. In another study,
        Keerthisingam 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] reported that fibrotic
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> had decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production in response to TGFβ
        stimulation. This study differed from ours in that a
        different stimulus was used. Of significance is the fact
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gene is known to be NF-κB dependent, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>, but not TGFβ, is a potent inducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-κB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Hence, the pathway involved in the induction of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gene by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> may be different.
        Furthermore, a significant proportion of the fibroblasts
        used in the study by Keerthisingam 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] were obtained from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">systemic sclerosis</ENAMEX>, which makes their
        fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> more heterogeneous.
        Wilborn 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] also reported a
        decreased production of PGE 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 by IL-1β-stimulated IPF</ENAMEX> fibroblasts,
        due to decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . There is a
        possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> selection may have differed
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies. However, we feel certain that the
        diagnostic accuracy of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> was high, due
        to the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> out of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> IPF subjects
        included in our study underwent lung transplantation with
        confirmatory pathology results consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>. The
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had biopsy-proven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>. In addition, our
        results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts
        obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with advanced stage IPF with those
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at an earlier stage of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, who had
        received no therapy. Although the reasons for our different
        results are unclear, the fact that we found similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        expression and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX> lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> suggests that loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression is not a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the
        lungs of subjects with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IPF</ENAMEX> human lungs have a significant and similar induction of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> enzyme when stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>, but that IPF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> produced more thromboxane and had a
        significantly lower prostacyclin:thromboxane ratio. We
        hypothesize that the lower PGI 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 :TXA</TIMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF-IPF</ENAMEX> may be a
        phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPF</ENAMEX>.
