        One mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction
        is through cytokine production or induction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prostaglandin E-2</ENAMEX> (PGE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), constitutively produced by many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> has been identified as one factor that has direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> properties and is known to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL10</ENAMEX> in
        mononuclear cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . IL10 is a dominant
        immunosuppressive cytokine found in the NSCLC environment
        known to directly affect T cell-mediated immunity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> have been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">suppress antigen</ENAMEX> presentation, to suppress cytotoxic T cell
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTL</ENAMEX>) responses, and to inhibit cytokine production by T
        cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX>, perhaps most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">importantly IL12</ENAMEX>, that plays a central role in initiation
        and potentiation of cellular immune responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX>
        ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . We asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGE</ENAMEX>-2
        levels and/or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> levels were elevated in plasma of NSCLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, whether monocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NSCLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> produce
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL10</ENAMEX> than normals, and whether there was correlation
        within our findings. As an additional 
        in vitro correlate, we evaluated
        differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> production by normal adherent
        peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in conditioned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> from cell lines that produce variable amounts of
        PGE-2.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> produced by tumor cell lines correlated with
          IL10 production by normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> adherent PBMC
          To confirm observations from the literature,
          supernatants from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> different NSCLC cell lines producing
          variable amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> (ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 pg/ml/5 × 10</ENAMEX>
          5cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>50,000 pg/ml/5 × 10 5cells</ENAMEX>) were compared
          directly for their ability to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL10</ENAMEX> in adherent
          mononuclear cells. Each cell line induced <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL10</NUMEX> in
          adherent mononuclear cells that was greater than control.
          This relative increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> correlated with PGE-2
          produced by each cell line (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels in plasma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
          NSCLC
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> separate assays yielded similar elevations in
          plasma levels of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">PGE2</NUMEX> above normals. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> used
          different sets of normals for comparison. Significant
          differences were seen when comparing measurements from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NSCLC samples</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9 normals</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-40</ENAMEX> vs.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">519</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-54</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0167</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> NSCLC patient samples to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> normals
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">846</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-62</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1838</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-213</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0011</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Absolute measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> differed between assays that
          prevented the pooling of results; relative values may
          reflect differences in sample handling or assay
          conditions, or differences in ELISA kits themselves.
          Plasma <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> levels measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> patient samples were
          not significantly elevated above controls (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.6 ± 4.6</NUMEX> vs.
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.9 ± 3.6</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>; not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels did not
          correlate with stage or histology (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > 0.1 all
          comparisons).
        
        
          Cytokine profiles of adherent mononuclear cells
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> patients
          Adherent cells, predominantly mononuclear phagocytes,
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were evaluated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> production.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> show adherent mononuclear cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> patients
          produced baseline levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL10</ENAMEX> significantly greater
          than those of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 ± 25</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX>; p
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). IL10 production did not correlate
          with stage or histology (not shown).
        
        
          Correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> production
          from adherent mononuclear cells
          Paired comparisons of plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels and
          mononuclear cell IL10 was possible in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> patient samples.
          Paired comparisons in patient sample did not reach
          statistical significance (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.1</NUMEX>), although in a
          subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> samples with the
          highest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels, a positive correlation of PGE-2
          levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> production was apparent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>;
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). There was no simple explanation for these
          outliers, nor rationale for excluding these samples.
          There was a significant correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> production in normal samples (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), but
          combining normals and patient data did not strengthen the
          statistical observations.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is an inducible enzyme upregulated in inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Notably, many NSCLC and what have been
        characterized as "premalignant" lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> have been
        shown to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX> express the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> and
        produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-2</ENAMEX> (PGE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), the primary product of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, PGE-2
        production by tumor cells has been linked to tumor-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppression</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to directly suppress T cell mediated immunity, the
        primary effector against tumor cells, at a variety of
        levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        induce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IL10</TIMEX> in mononuclear cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . IL10 is a
        prominent immunosuppressive cytokine that may have a
        dominant role in preventing innate antitumor responses in
        the NSCLC environment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Among myriad suppressive effects on T cells
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> is known to inhibit IL12
        production [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . IL12 plays a key role in
        the initiation and potentiation of cellular immune
        responses and alteration of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL12</NUMEX> producing function in
        circulating mononuclear phagocytes may be a critical factor
        in suppressed T cell immunity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        We evaluated both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> in plasma of NSCLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> finding only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> to be significantly elevated
        above controls. Elevations were independent of stage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor histology</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> also show mononuclear
        phagocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NSCLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> produce significantly more
        IL10 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 24</NUMEX> hr in primary culture than controls,
        consistent with reports of altered cytokine profiles of
        adherent mononuclear cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] . Although 
        in vitro experiments suggest there
        could be a direct link between elevated plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels
        and increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL10</ENAMEX> production by adherent mononuclear cells
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX>, the measurements of patient samples do not
        support a simple causal relationship. The correlation seen
        in a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples may reflect only the
        presence of underlying malignancy, however, it is tempting
        to speculate on the physiologic relationship between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> can be induced by a number of inflammatory
        conditions, however no single factor, other than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, is
        likely to account for the significant differences seen in
        this series. Absolute values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX>, that may vary with
        different assays, are likely less important than the
        observed differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and normals. The lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> stage or histology, and the
        nonspecific production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> by multiple cell types, may
        limit the usefulness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> as a specific, independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX>.
        Apart from standardized measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> as a marker
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, a biologically relevant aspect of elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGE-2</ENAMEX> would be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with altered immune
        profile of mononuclear phagocytes, specifically IL10
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, serum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> levels were established
        as an independent marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and response to
        therapy by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Vita et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The source of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL10</NUMEX> in
        that series was thought to be from mononuclear cells. Based
        on the observations and conclusions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>,
        and the measurable increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> production by
        mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phagocytes</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NSCLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared
        to controls, plasma levels of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">IL10</NUMEX> from these patients
        might be expected to also be elevated. In the current
        series, however, there was no difference between patient
        and control plasma <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> levels. The reasons for this
        discrepancy are unclear, and may be related to differences
        in handling/processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> or differences in the
        sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> used in the studies. Further,
        there was no significant correlation between IL10
        production by mononuclear cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> stage, as might
        be inferred from the previously mentioned studies. There
        was no correlation with histologic type of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Plasma PGE-2</ENAMEX> levels may be a nonspecific marker for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and warrants further investigation. In contrast,
        plasma <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> levels did not appear to be sensitive markers
        in our studies; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL10</ENAMEX> production by circulating mononuclear
        cells, however appears to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The
        reasons for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL10</TIMEX> production by mononuclear cells in NSCLC
        are speculative and may be varied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plasma PGE-2</ENAMEX> may
        contribute but cannot be simply and directly linked.
