        Rab <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> comprise a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ras</ENAMEX>-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> that function in the anterograde and retrograde
        trafficking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX> reside in specific subcellular
        membranes or organelles, where they mediate vesicular
        transport between discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor compartments
        in the endocytic or exocytic pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Detailed
        studies of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g</ENAMEX> .; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab5 and Rab9</TIMEX>) have led
        to a general model wherein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX> are presumed to
        cycle on and off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor membranes in connection
        with changes in their guanine nucleotide state [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        In the active GTP-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> associate with
        budding transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] and appear to
        participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of membrane docking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Following vesicle fusion with the acceptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the inactive</TIMEX> GDP-bound Rab
        is extracted from the membrane by a carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> termed
        guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX>
        ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> can then re-enter the transport cycle
        through nucleotide exchange promoted by a specific exchange
        factor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> vesicle membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition to changes in guanine nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the
        posttranslational prenylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX> plays an
        important role in the cycling mechanism. Non-modified Rabs
        have a low affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 17</NUMEX> ] and do not associate
        effectively with membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Rab24, originally identified by Olkkonen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , remains one of
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> without a confirmed
        biological function. We have described several unusual
        features of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> that distinguish it from all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> studied to date [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Rab24
        has a markedly reduced GTPase activity, due primarily to
        the presence of a serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> instead of the usual
        glutamine at the position equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Q61</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-Ras</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> is not efficiently geranylgeranylated
        and does not form a detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDI</ENAMEX>. These
        unique properties of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> suggest that it may not function
        according to the accepted cyclical model.
        In the present study we set out to learn about the
        biological function of Rab24 by using a well-established
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paradigm</ENAMEX> in which a dominant-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rab</ENAMEX> construct is
        expressed in cultured cells, anticipating that it will
        suppress the trafficking step(s) mediated by its endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> at the position
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognate</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">N116</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-Ras</ENAMEX> typically yield soluble Rab
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have a reduced affinity for guanine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. Such constructs have been used successfully to
        define the functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab1A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab1B</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] , Rab4
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab5</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Unexpectedly, we
        found that expression of the mutant forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> in
        cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> resulted in their accumulation in a striking
        array of insoluble intranuclear inclusions which disrupt
        the integrity of the nuclear envelope.
      
      
        Results
        
          Mutant forms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> accumulate in nuclear
          inclusions
          In all of the known Ras-related GTPases the guanine
          nucleotide binding site is surrounded by a set of highly
          conserved sequence elements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, termed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G2</NUMEX> motif, consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NKxD</ENAMEX> (with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">asparagine</ENAMEX> located at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-Ras</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>,
          and in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, threonine occurs
          instead of the asparagine. Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif cause a drastic reduction in the
          affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ras</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> for guanine nucleotides [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . When overexpressed in cultured cells, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant GTPases</ENAMEX> function as dominant-suppressors of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 31</NUMEX> ] , presumably because
          they can compete for interaction with effectors, exchange
          factors or docking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but cannot cycle on and off
          membranes in a nucleotide-dependent manner. We set out to
          assess the function of Rab24 by making substitutions in
          its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TKxD</ENAMEX> motif, starting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D123--->I.</ENAMEX> To facilitate
          localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the wild-type and mutant
          constructs were made with a myc-epitope tag at the amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX>. The addition of such tag sequences to
          Ras-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, does not appear to alter their function or
          subcellular localization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] .
          When mycRab24(wt) was transiently expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX>
          cells, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a diffuse
          reticular distribution throughout the cytoplasm, with a
          concentration in the perinuclear region (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). In
          contrast, when the same studies were performed with cells
          expressing mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>), we observed a striking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in punctate structures
          localized in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.
          In most cells the inclusions appeared to be concentrated
          predominantly within the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Identical
          structures were seen when immunofluorescence microscopy
          was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal myc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal hypervariable domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>,
          indicating that the immunofluorescence pattern reflected
          the localization of full-length mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>). Finally,
          the localization pattern of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) remained the
          same when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was expressed without the myc tag
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          Western blot analyses of cytosol and particulate
          fractions obtained from the transfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells
          indicated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mycRab24</TIMEX>(wt) was present in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX>, consistent with previous results with Rab24
          and other wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab GTPases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 39</NUMEX> ] . In contrast,
          mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) was found exclusively in the particulate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fraction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). When transfected cells were disrupted
          in a buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP-40</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> deoxycholate and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>, most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) was recovered in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-insoluble fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D). This suggested
          that the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was concentrated in inclusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> rather than membrane components.
          The nuclear inclusions containing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) were
          not cell-type specific. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Ashows that similar
          punctate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were formed when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D123I</NUMEX> mutant was
          expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. We also verified that
          the unique behavior of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> mutant was not related
          specifically to the substitution at the aspartate
          position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif. Thus, similar inclusions
          were observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> was expressed with substitutions
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N/T</ENAMEX> position; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T120A</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A) or T120I
          (not shown). To test the possibility that protein
          aggregates might be formed when 
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPase</ENAMEX> is overexpressed
          with a mutation that impairs nucleotide binding, we
          examined the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> containing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif. In all cases, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> exhibited a
          general cytoplasmic localization with no evidence of
          nuclear inclusions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          Rab24 is known to be expressed endogenously in many
          cell types, including the cell lines used in these
          studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , and we have estimated that both
          mycRab24wt and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D123I</ENAMEX> are transiently expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-10</ENAMEX> fold
          over the level of endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> (data not shown).
          Therefore, a question raised by these studies is whether
          the genesis of nuclear inclusions occurs indirectly,
          through dominant suppression of endogenous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> function
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D123I and T120A</TIMEX> mutants, or directly, through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the accumulating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We attempted to distinguish between these
          possibilities by using an alternative strategy to make a
          dominant-negative form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
          have shown that in addition to mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>, which reduce overall nucleotide binding,
          dominant-negative Rab constructs can be generated by
          introducing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g. , asparagine) at the position
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognate</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S17</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S22</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 40 41 42</NUMEX>
          ] . Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are thought to be locked in an inactive
          GDP-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> because the mutation markedly reduces
          their affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>, compared to GDP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B, when mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S22N</NUMEX>) was expressed in 3T3
          cells, there was no evidence of nuclear inclusions.
          However, when the bound 32P-labeled nucleotides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were analyzed by
          thin-layer chromatography (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C), we were surprised to
          find that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S22N</NUMEX> mutant was predominantly in the
          GTP-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The inability of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S22N</NUMEX> substitution
          to substantially reduce the affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> for GTP
          adds to the growing list of fundamental differences
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Rab24</TIMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In a
          previous study we observed that replacing S67 with Q
          (which occupies this position all other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX>)
          increases the GTPase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , resulting
          in a modest increase in the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the GDP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">versus GTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). When this mutant was
          expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells we again failed to observe
          inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Since neither Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S22N</NUMEX>) nor
          Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S67Q</NUMEX>) showed evidence of being locked in a
          GDP-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, it is unlikely that either would
          function as a dominant-negative. Thus, the question of
          whether the nuclear inclusions containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D123I</TIMEX> and
          T120A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are caused by dominant-negative suppression
          of endogenous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> function remains to be resolved.
        
        
          Morphological characteristics of the nuclear
          inclusions
          Several follow-up studies supported the notion that
          the punctate structures containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> mutants were
          inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> rather than membrane-bound organelles.
          For example, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
          little or no overlap between these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and markers
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rab6,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lens</ENAMEX> culinaris lectin), endosome
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EEA1</NUMEX>) or lysosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LAMP-1</ENAMEX>) membranes (data not shown).
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab24</ENAMEX> has been proposed as a possible regulator
          of autophagic processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 43</NUMEX> ] , the accumulation of
          punctate bodies in cells expressing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) was not
          prevented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methyadenine, a known inhibitor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autophagosome</ENAMEX> formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Most importantly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopy with immunogold labeling of
          mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) in ultra-thin sections confirmed the
          initial impression that the inclusions are in fact
          localized within the nucleus. The expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          concentrated in clusters of dense granules of fairly
          uniform diameter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80-150 nm</NUMEX>) with no evidence of a
          surrounding membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inclusions</ENAMEX> containing mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) were similar to
          those observed inside the nucleus, except that they were
          larger, with a diameter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times that of the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D). Such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were never observed
          in cells expressing mycRab24wt or any other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPase</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Disruption of nuclear architecture by inclusions
          containing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>)
          The accumulation of nuclear inclusions in cells
          expressing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) led to progressive degeneration
          of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Figure 4shows a series of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representative</ENAMEX> photographs of transfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells that
          were co-stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> myc
          epitope, combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX> to visualize the chromatin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A), or an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamins A</ENAMEX> and B to
          visualize the nuclear envelope (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after
          transfection, we observed many cells with
          mycRab24-positive inclusions that showed fairly uniform
          staining of the nuclear envelope with no loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> or deformation of nuclear shape. However, in
          some cells with larger and more numerous inclusions we
          observed discontinuities in the anti-lamin staining of
          the nuclear envelope and some co-localization of lamin
          with mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) in the intranuclear aggregates. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> in the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> were clearly visible in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> micrographs of cells with large numbers of
          intranuclear aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). In the most extreme
          cases, the nuclear envelope was significantly distorted
          and fragmented and there was leakage of chromatin into
          the cytoplasm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A& <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, lower panels). The number
          of cells with obvious nuclear disruption increased with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, so that by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-h this was seen in the majority of
          the transfected cells (not shown).
          The morphological changes occurring in cells with
          accumulated Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) inclusions did not match the
          hallmark features of apoptosis ( 
          e.g. , membrane blebbing,
          condensation of chromatin at the nuclear periphery). This
          was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assays where cells at various
          stages of nuclear inclusion body accumulation showed no
          evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX>, either before or after
          disruption of the nuclear envelope (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). In
          contrast, TUNEL-positive cells were readily detected in
          parallel cultures where apoptosis was induced by
          treatment with staurosporine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
        
        
          Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) disrupts nuclear import of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor
          Rab24 contains a unique arginine-rich insert,
          126EEDRRRRR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] in the domain cognate to loop-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-Ras</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The latter sequence is reminiscent of
          unusual arginine-rich nuclear localization signals that
          allow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tet</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rev</ENAMEX> to undergo nuclear
          translocation by association with importin-β, in the
          absence of importin-α [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . Since the loop-8 insert
          in Rab24 lies adjacent to the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD
          nucleotide binding cassette, we hypothesized that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes caused by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D123I</TIMEX> substitution
          might render <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rab24</TIMEX> mutant capable of disrupting the
          nuclear import machinery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . To test this
          possibility, we co-expressed mycRab24wt or
          mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR-GFP</ENAMEX>, a fusion between the
          glucocorticoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contains a prototypical nuclear localization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> but remains in the cytoplasm when expressed in
          cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>. Upon addition
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 μM</NUMEX> dexamethasone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dex</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is translocated
          into the nucleus within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR-GFP</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells, we
          observed normal ligand-dependent translocation of GR-GFP
          into the nucleus when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dex</ENAMEX> was applied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). However,
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR-GFP</ENAMEX> was coexpressed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mycRab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) there
          was a striking perturbation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor localization</ENAMEX>.
          Instead of remaining in the cytoplasm in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">steroid</ENAMEX>, nearly all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR-GFP</ENAMEX> was found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and nuclear inclusion bodies containing the
          Rab24 mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). The latter point is clearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the overlap of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR-GFP</ENAMEX> (green) fluorescence
          with rhodamine-IgG staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mycRab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) (red) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B. The possibility that the inclusions induced by
          mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) contain aggregated nuclear import
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> was further supported by immuno-staining with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against importin-β (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">karyopherin-β</ENAMEX>), which
          revealed focal concentrations of importin-β in these
          structures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). However, other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as Ran
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ran GAP</ENAMEX> (not shown), which
          are recruited to the nuclear import complex through
          interactions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ran GTPase</ENAMEX>, did not appear to be
          present in the inclusion bodies.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal hypervariable domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> is
          required for the formation of inclusions
          To learn more about the structural features of
          Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) that are responsible for triggering the
          formation of nuclear inclusions, we focused on regions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that distinguish Rab24 from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. We began by deleting a portion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">loop-8</ENAMEX> insert, described in the preceding section. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids (ΔEDRR</ENAMEX>) were removed from both Rab24(wt) and
          Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>). Immunofluorescent localization studies
          showed that this modification had no effect on
          distribution of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A) and, contrary to expectations, did not
          interfere with the accumulation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D123I</NUMEX> mutant in
          nuclear inclusions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> region where the sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> differs
          substantially from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPases</ENAMEX> is the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail. This region, commonly
          referred to as the hypervariable domain, plays a major
          role in the subcellular targeting and functional
          specificity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . In accord with
          this view, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of the hypervariable domain of
          Rab24(wt) with the corresponding domain from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab1B</TIMEX>,
          caused the resulting chimera to exhibit a discrete
          juxtanuclear Golgi-like fluorescence pattern typical of
          Rab1B in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] . (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C). When the D123I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> was introduced into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> portion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rab24/Rab1B</ENAMEX> chimera, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was no longer targeted
          to inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8D), but instead exhibited a
          diffuse distribution similar to Rab1B(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N121I</NUMEX>) and other
          Rabs with mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To
          confirm the importance of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> hypervariable domain
          for targeting to inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, we performed the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reciprocal</ENAMEX> experiment, replacing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain of
          Rab1B(wt) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rab1B</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N121I</NUMEX>) with the hypervariable domain
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from Rab24</TIMEX>. Instead of the usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab1B</TIMEX> juxtanuclear Golgi
          localization, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rab1B</TIMEX>(wt)/Rab24 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chimera</ENAMEX> showed a
          broader cytoplasmic distribution similar to that of
          Rab24(wt) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8E). Most notably, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of
          hypervariable domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab1B</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N121I</NUMEX>) with the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> caused a major
          change in the localization of the chimera from a
          predominant cytoplasmic distribution typical of
          Rab1B(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N121I</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) to a pattern of large intranuclear
          and cytoplasmic inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8F).
          To determine whether the hypervariable domain of Rab24
          was sufficient to promote the formation of inclusion
          bodies when fused to a heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, we prepared
          fusion constructs with enhanced green fluorescent protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX>) containing either full-length Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) or just
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24 C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Rab24</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) accumulated in inclusion bodies similar
          to those described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mycRab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>). In
          contrast, the EGFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing only the
          hypervariable domain of Rab24 exhibited a diffuse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and nuclear localization that was essentially
          identical to the pattern observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          9B& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9C</ENAMEX>). Therefore, it appears that although the
          C-terminal domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> is required to promote its
          incorporation into inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, it does so only when
          expressed in the context of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPase</ENAMEX> with a mutation
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD nucleotide binding motif.
        
        
          Nuclear inclusions generated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>)
          contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ubiquitin</ENAMEX> and Hsp70
          Although the formation of intranuclear inclusions has
          not been observed in previous studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ras</ENAMEX>-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX>, it is a common feature of several
          neurodegenerative disorders where abnormal proteins
          containing poly-Gln tracts are synthesized as a result of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> codon expansions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . Examples include
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington's disease</ENAMEX> (huntingtin) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54</NUMEX> ] ,
          spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ataxin-1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ataxin-3</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atrophy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">atrophin-1</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . These poly-Gln protein
          aggregates typically contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ubiquitin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] and members
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Hsp70</NUMEX> chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] , consistent with a
          proposed pathway for cellular clearance of toxic
          misfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We noted that the inclusions caused
          by expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) were similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologically</ENAMEX> to those described in some of the
          poly-Gln <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> and hypothesized that they might arise
          via a similar pathway. An immunofluorescence study was
          performed to determine whether or not the intranuclear
          Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) aggregates might sequester ubiquitin and
          Hsp70. Both ubiquitin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10A) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp70</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10B)
          showed substantial overlap with nuclear and cytoplasmic
          aggregates containing mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>). In contrast, the
          aggregates did not contain Hsp90 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10C), suggesting
          that the sequestration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp70</ENAMEX> was specific.
          To determine whether ubiquitin was conjugated directly
          to Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>), it was necessary to solubilize the
          protein aggregates in a high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> buffer that was
          incompatible with standard immunoprecipitation methods.
          Therefore, we generated a mammalian expression vector
          encoding a His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -tagged version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) and
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ni 2</ENAMEX>+affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> to isolate the expressed protein
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> extracts. When expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells the
          His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) accumulated in
          inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> that were morphologically identical to
          those formed by the myc-tagged and untagged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (not
          shown). When the His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was extracted from
          the inclusions and subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, we saw no
          evidence of higher molecular mass forms that would
          correspond to poly-ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, using either
          anti-His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 11A) or anti-Rab24 (not shown)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of the His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) isolated from cells
          treated with lactacystin (to block degradation of
          poly-ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 26S</TIMEX> proteasome) showed
          no detectable ubiquitin associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          although the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> detected multiple
          ubiquitinated polypeptides in the whole-cell lysate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          11B). Again, these findings agree with recent studies of
          poly-Gln <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> aggregates, which indicate that although
          ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are present in the inclusions,
          they are not conjugated directly to the initiating
          poly-Gln polypeptide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Here we have shown that single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitutions
        ( 
        e.g. , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D123I and T120A</TIMEX>) in one of the
        conserved guanine nucleotide binding domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> can
        cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to accumulate in a massive array of
        nuclear inclusions in mammalian cells. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras GTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX> have been studied for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
        using site-directed mutagenesis approaches, there have been
        no previous reports demonstrating cytopathic effects of
        this kind. In particular, as we have shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, a
        variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX> bearing similar mutations are
        localized in the cytoplasmic compartment.
        It remains unclear whether the nuclear inclusions
        induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) are generated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> inside the nucleus or instead
        penetrate the nuclear membrane after being assembled in the
        cytoplasmic compartment. Rab24 does not have a classic
        nuclear localization signal sequence, but monomeric
        mycRab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) is theoretically small enough (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24 kDa</NUMEX>) to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffuse</ENAMEX> across the nuclear pores [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . However, it is
        less likely that this could occur in the case of the larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Rab24</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) fusion construct (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 kDa</NUMEX>), which also
        formed abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intranuclear inclusions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Our
        preliminary observations indicate that some of the
        intranuclear inclusions containing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) are
        immunoreactive for lamins, while those outside the nucleus
        are not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). Moreover, the electron micrographs show
        that nuclei containing clusters of inclusions often have
        regions where the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> appears to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discontinuous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). Based on these findings, we
        believe that aggregates formed in the cytoplasm may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> associate with and disrupt the nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX>, then enter the nucleus through the resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, the accumulation of nuclear inclusions in
        cells expressing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) causes a catastrophic
        disruption of the nuclear architecture, although this does
        not appear to be accompanied by classic signs of apoptotic
        cell death such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> or caspase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
        The molecular mechanism underlying the formation of
        nuclear inclusions in cells expressing the mutant forms of
        Rab24 remains to be defined. An extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of published
        work supports the notion that Rab <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> bearing
        mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD nucleotide binding motif function
        as dominant-suppressors of their endogenous cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. Our domain-exchange experiments with Rab24
        and Rab1B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) indicate that incorporation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into nuclear inclusions requires the
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal hypervariable targeting domain of
        Rab24. Therefore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possibility is that the inclusions
        arise as a consequence of disruption of the normal
        physiological function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>. To explore this issue
        further, we attempted to generate another potential
        dominant-negative form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>, predicted to be locked in
        the GDP <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. However, when we made the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        substitution customarily used to generate such Rab mutants
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">i.e. , S22N</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab24</ENAMEX> unexpectedly
        remained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Therefore, pending further
        investigation, we cannot rule out the alternative
        hypothesis that mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>,
        combined with features in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain, cause
        Rab24 to misfold in a unique manner, attracting
        non-physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> that can promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and nuclear localization.
        As a framework for future studies we can envision at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> models that could explain the accumulation of
        inclusion bodies in cells expressing Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>). Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) suggest that the
        inclusions are complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein assemblies</ENAMEX> containing Hsp70
        and ubiquitin. Therefore, the first possibility is that the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp70</ENAMEX> and ubiquitin reflects a failed attempt
        by the cell to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded protein</ENAMEX> aggregates via
        the proteasome pathway. Indeed, a similar explanation has
        been invoked to explain the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp70</ENAMEX> and ubiquitin
        in nuclear aggregates observed in cells expressing abnormal
        gene products with poly-Gln tracts, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">huntingtin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
        ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ataxin-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Based on reports that
        overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaperones</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 62</NUMEX> ] or a
        dominant-negative form of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] can suppress the formation of poly-Gln protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaytor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] proposed a three-stage
        model wherein (i) molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> initially associate
        with the misfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) failure to diminish the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded protein</ENAMEX> leads to aggregation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitination</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) inefficient degradation of the
        aggregate by the proteasome is manifested by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of inclusion bodies. Although this model
        implies that the misfolded poly-Gln <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might be the
        primary substrate for ubiquitination, a recent study by
        Suhr 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] suggests that this may
        not always be the case. Specifically, they found that when
        aggregates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells expressing poly-Gln <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        dissociated, the ubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> were not conjugated
        directly to the poly-Gln <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or the sequestered
        Hsp70.
        An alternative mechanism for the formation of inclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> conformation <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> is suggested by a
        recent study showing that clearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">poly-Gln</ENAMEX> and
        poly-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> inclusions is accelerated by compounds like
        rapamycin, which stimulate protein degradation by autophagy
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . Along similar lines, the work of Kegel 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] hints that poly-Gln
        huntingtin may be degraded mainly in autophagic vacuoles
        containing lysosomal proteases. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> has
        been implicated as a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of autophagy in a
        recent study where wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Rab24</ENAMEX> was observed to
        accumulate on large autophagic vacuoles in cells subjected
        to amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Thus, if Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>)
        functions as a true dominant suppressor of endogenous
        Rab24, the inclusions observed in the present study may
        consist of misfolded endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that cannot be
        degraded because basal activity of the
        autophagosome-lysosome pathway is blocked.
        Although the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two preceding</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may explain the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp70</ENAMEX> and ubiquitin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rab24</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>)-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, the incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) and importin-β (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) may point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>
        distinct scenario. Aside from its well-characterized role
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> folding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp70</ENAMEX> is known to associate
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm, where it promotes formation
        of a heterocomplex between the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp90</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ]
        . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp70</ENAMEX> becomes concentrated in the nucleus
        when cells are exposed to environmental stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . Of
        particular note, the nuclear accumulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Hsp70</TIMEX>,
        Ssa4p, in response to nutrient deprivation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> appears
        to occur by a novel mechanism that involves its direct
        interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mmd5p</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the importin-β <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> ] . A role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> in nuclear trafficking would be
        unanticipated, since the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> known to function in
        nuclear import/export (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ran</ENAMEX>) is structurally distinct from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab</ENAMEX> subgroup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superfamily</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 71</NUMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, we can speculate that if Rab24 participates
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> for nuclear import of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp70</ENAMEX> in
        mammalian cells, the constitutive overexpression of
        Rab24(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) might stimulate aberrant accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hsp70/importin</ENAMEX>-β aggregates at the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complex</ENAMEX>.
        This might ultimately result in disruption of the nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX> and penetration of the aggregates into the
        nucleus. If the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Hsp70</NUMEX> in these aggregates retains the
        capacity to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX>, this could account for the
        sequestration of nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        It is well established that mutations affecting the
        guanine nucleotide state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neoplastic</ENAMEX> transformation of mammalian cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 72 73</NUMEX> ] .
        However, the potential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab</ENAMEX> mutations in disease is
        just beginning to be explored. Menasche 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] found mutations in the
        Rab27A gene in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Griscelli's syndrome</ENAMEX>, an
        autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pigmentation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lymphocyte</ENAMEX> and macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. While several of the mutations were deletions,
        a few were missense mutations that changed single amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in conserved regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Mutations
        in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab27A</NUMEX> gene have also been detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the
        coat color mutation 
        ashen , which is regarded as a model
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Griscelli's syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 76</NUMEX> ] . Rab24 can be detected
        in many tissues and cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , but expression
        appears to be highest in neuronal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . At present
        there are no available data specifically linking Rab24
        mutations to human disease. However, there are many case
        reports describing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with progressive
        neurodegenerative disorders of unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etiology</ENAMEX>,
        collectively referred to as neuronal intranuclear inclusion
        disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] . While these may consist mainly of
        unidentified poly-Gln or poly-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> disorders, the present
        study raises the possibility that some forms of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> may arise through unexpected mechanisms, perhaps
        involving mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX> or other poorly characterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that mediate trafficking
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded proteins</ENAMEX> within autophagosomes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysosomes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Previous studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> exhibits several
        unusual characteristics that distinguish it from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rab GTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The studies
        described in this report demonstrate that putative
        dominant-negative mutant forms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>, bearing single
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD
        nucleotide binding motif ( 
        e.g. , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D123I and T120A</TIMEX>), are targeted
        to numerous inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> that disrupt the nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX> and enter the nuclear compartment. The inclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> a superficial resemblance to those described in some
        of the polyglutamine disorders, and appear to sequester
        Hsp70, ubiquitin, importin-β, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid receptor</ENAMEX>.
        Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rab24/Rab1B</ENAMEX> chimeras indicate that the unusual
        cytopathic effects induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D123I</TIMEX> mutant require
        sequence elements within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rab24</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal hypervariable
        targeting domain. Similar mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)KxD motif of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab proteins</ENAMEX> typically yield soluble cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confirmatory</ENAMEX> studies with other potential
        dominant-negative mutants, such as those bearing
        substitutions at the position cognate to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S17</ENAMEX>, were not
        possible with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>, because such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutants</ENAMEX> remained in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The present results further highlight the unique
        nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> and raise the possibility that it may
        function in autophagic degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded proteins</ENAMEX>,
        or perhaps play an unanticipated role in nuclear protein
        trafficking or maintenance/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the nuclear
        envelope.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Expression constructs
          The cDNA encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab24</ENAMEX> was obtained by PCR
          amplification from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA template
          reverse-transcribed from mouse brain mRNA, using 
          Taq <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin Elmer</ENAMEX>).
          Oligonucleotide primers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction were based
          on the published sequence of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rab24</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Kpn1
          and BamH1 restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          primers respectively, to facilitate cloning of the PCR
          product in frame with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' sequence cassette encoding a
          myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL), previously introduced into the
          pCMV5 expression vector [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rab24</NUMEX> cDNA was
          altered by overlap-extension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] , using
          appropriate mutator oligonucleotides and 
          Pfu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (Stratagene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA), so as to introduce amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(ΔEDRR</ENAMEX>). The cDNA encoding human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rab11</ENAMEX> was obtained by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA template,
          reverse-transcribed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hela</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell mRNA</ENAMEX>. This sequence
          was cloned into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pCMV5</TIMEX>, in-frame with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' myc epitope tag
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and altered to encode <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N124I</TIMEX> substitution as
          stated above for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rab24</TIMEX>. Other pCMV5 expression vectors

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was eluted with
          Buffer D containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> imidazole. Samples of the
          eluted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and immunoblot
          analysis as described previously, using a polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against Rab24 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , or monoclonal antibodies
          against the His

          Cell death assay
          Cells were transfected with pCMV5 expression vectors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mycRab24</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D123I</NUMEX>) as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX> was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
          transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
          assay, using fluorescein-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-dUTP, according to the
          instructions supplied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega Corp.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> reaction, the cells
          were incubated with monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-myc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and
          Rhodamine-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAM IgG</ENAMEX> to detect the expressed Rab
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine
          the number of transfected cells that were TUNEL-positive,
          compared to non-transfected cells in the same culture. As
          a positive control for apoptosis, parallel cultures were
          treated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 μM</NUMEX> staurosporine.
