        The factors responsible for the age-related incidence of
        post-diarrheal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemolytic uremic syndrome</ENAMEX> (HUS) are unknown.
        Clinical data indicate that the peak incidence of HUS
        occurs around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years of age</TIMEX>, but the disease clearly
        occurs in significant numbers of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Population-based studies suggest that there is a decline in
        the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> from a peak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 1-2 years</TIMEX> until a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nadir</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about age 11 years</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In addition, a
        case-control study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX> outbreak of HUS
        revealed that the mean age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, while the mean age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These studies raise the possibility,
        therefore, that the appearance or disappearance of a factor
        or factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> reduces susceptibility
        to end-organ injury in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> is thought to be due, at least in large part, to
        Shiga <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX>)-mediated cell toxicity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Since the
        kidney is a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX>, it
        has been hypothesized that the preferential renal injury
        occurring in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> is related to heightened
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal susceptibility</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> in this age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Such
        increased renal sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, if it does
        indeed exist, could be due to a wide variety of factors.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> immediately apparent factor that has been examined is
        age-related alterations in renal Stx binding and Stx
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (galactose-Î±-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>, galactose-Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose-ceramide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Gb3</NUMEX>)) expression. An autopsy study
        determined that total kidney <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gb3</TIMEX> levels were lower in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> under
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 years of age</TIMEX> were examined) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Another study using
        immunostaining of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biopsy samples</ENAMEX> found that glomeruli from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infants</ENAMEX> (under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years of age</TIMEX>), but not from older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This provocative
        finding, albeit involving a relatively small sample size
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who often had glomerulopathies, provided a
        potential explanation for augmented glomerular Stx
        sensitivity in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Confirmation of these
        observations is needed, however they do suggest that Gb3
        levels, and in particular the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> Gb3
        expression, may be a factor in the age-related incidence of
        renal injury in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX>.
        The decreased incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HUS renal disease</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adolescents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> raises the possibility that factors
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with puberty may be involved. There have been no
        studies, to our knowledge, that have examined the effects
        of puberty-related hormonal alterations on renal cell
        sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX>. Indeed, there is no information
        whatsoever on how any sex steroid affects Stx
        responsiveness of any cell type. It seemed reasonable,
        therefore, to examine whether sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> (estrogen,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and testosterone) could modify the cytotoxic
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> on renal cells. Further, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gb3</TIMEX> levels may
        be altered with aging, the effect of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> on renal
        cell Gb3 expression was examined.
        Several renal cell types have been demonstrated to
        respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX>. Based on histologic evidence, glomerular
        endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been invoked as being primarily
        involved in HUS renal injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In vitro studies have
        demonstrated that human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEN)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bind Stx-1</ENAMEX> and are modestly sensitive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>'s
        cytotoxic effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Recent work indicates that other
        renal cell types may be Stx <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in HUS: cultured human
        proximal tubule (HPT) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and human visceral glomerular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> (HGEC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] cells express abundant amounts of
        Gb3 and are highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of
        Stx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Consequently, the current study examined the effect
        of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity on, and Gb3
        expression by, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture
          Primary cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> were obtained from Clonetics
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA) and studied at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> passage. The
          identity and purity of these cultures was established by
          immunofluorescent staining as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          (in addition to the extensive characterization by
          Clonetics, we have determined that these cells lack von
          Willebrand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and platelet endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> (PECAM), but are positive for cytokeratin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> and alkaline phosphatase activity).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> were maintained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco's Modified Eagle</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM L-glutamine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">250 Î¼g/L</ENAMEX> amphotericin
          B, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml hydrocortisone, 10 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml
          transferrin, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.7 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml selenium, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/L</ENAMEX> ethanolamine,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml L-thyroxine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml epidermal growth factor,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum (FBS). Hydrocortisone was
          present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> do not grow well in the
          absence of corticosteroids (personal observation).
          Primary cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX> were obtained from Cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kirkland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>) and studied at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> passage.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been extensively characterized by Cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX>; in addition, we determined that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrand</ENAMEX> factor and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PECAM</ENAMEX>, but lack cytokeratin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX> were maintained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">EGM2</NUMEX>-MV media
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clonetics</ENAMEX>) which contains epidermal growth factor,
          hydrocortisone, vascular endothelial cell growth factor,
          basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX>, heparin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>.
          Primary cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEC</ENAMEX> were obtained from
          nephrectomies as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and studied
          at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> passage. Briefly, glomeruli were obtained by
          sieving <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal cortex</ENAMEX>, collagenase digested, and cultured
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml Endothelial</ENAMEX>
          Growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Supplement</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PerImmune, Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">penicillin/streptomycin</ENAMEX>). Primary cultures were passaged
          when <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> confluent and maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEC</ENAMEX> media
          thereafter. Cell identity and purity was determined as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] : all cells stained (by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX>) negative for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrand</ENAMEX> factor,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PECAM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-myosin</ENAMEX>, but were positive for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokeratin</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Stx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cytotoxicity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gb3</ENAMEX> expression
          Confluent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well plates were placed in their
          maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> without serum for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr and exposed to
          either high or low concentrations (see Results) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX>, Î²-estradiol or testosterone (all from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> in
          serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> (purified in our
          laboratory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ) was added for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr at concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 -5- 10 -11grams/liter.</ENAMEX> The neutral red cytotoxicity
          assay was performed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly, 50 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> neutral red
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199</NUMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> serum was added for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 hours</TIMEX>
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Cells were washed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> and solubilized in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absorption</ENAMEX> was read at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gb3</ENAMEX> content, cells grown in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-well plates were placed in serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr
          followed by addition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>.
          Gb3 was quantitated as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Briefly, cells were scraped off the plates, centrifuged,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pellet</ENAMEX> extracted in chloroform:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and
          separated on high performance thin layer
          chromatography-silica plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallinckrodt Baker Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KY</ENAMEX>) by ascending chromatography. The plates were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dried</ENAMEX>, immersed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> polyisobutylmethacrylate in
          acetone, and sequentially incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX>,
          anti-Stx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (purified from a hybridoma

          standardized to total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Prior to centrifugation, a
          cell aliquot was solubilized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N NaOH</ENAMEX>, mixed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford</ENAMEX> reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX>, CA) and protein
          concentration determined by measuring absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistics
          All data were analyzed by one way analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>. Individual conditions were compared using
          Student's t-test after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were taken as
          significant.
        
      
      
        Results
        Stx-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>) dose-dependently killed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> had an LD50

        As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stx-cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>, none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, at any dose
        or exposure time, modified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gb3</ENAMEX> content in any cell type (n
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> each condition, data not shown).
        Immunoreactive steroid concentration was determined in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> samples at the start and conclusion of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 day</TIMEX>
        experiment (analyzed in clinical laboratory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX>
        Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pathologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>) in
        order to determine the stability of the added <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estradiol</ENAMEX> and testosterone concentrations did not vary over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> in culture media. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Progesterone</ENAMEX> levels also
        did not fall after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 days</TIMEX> in culture media, however after
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> in media the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> concentration
        significantly dropped (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> decrease). Consequently, fresh
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX> was added to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 day</TIMEX> experiments every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        The failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity was
        not due to inactivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid preparations</ENAMEX>. Similar
        preparations and concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> from the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) were tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Meikle</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division of Endocrinology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Utah</ENAMEX> using
        an in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrogen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone binding assay</ENAMEX> and a
        testosterone-dependent stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> cell
        apoptosis assay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ; all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> retained biologic
        activity (data not shown).
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusion
        The reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> primarily affects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are
        unknown. It is evident that the peak incidence of HUS
        occurs in very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2 years of age). The
        factors responsible for this apparent heightened
        sensitivity to infection with Stx-expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have
        not been extensively investigated and were not examined in
        the current study. Indeed, it is conceivable that not all
        of the factors involved in HUS occurrence in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        are identical to those involved in the diminished HUS
        incidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Numerous factors could
        be involved in age-related Stx sensitivity, including
        differences in the degree of enteric invasion by
        Stx-producing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> transport across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gut</ENAMEX>, in circulating red or white blood cell toxin binding
        and delivery to the kidney, in the immune response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stx</ENAMEX>,
        in renal Stx binding, and/or in intrinsic or
        cofactor-regulated (e.g. inflammatory cytokines) renal Stx
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX>. The current study evaluated one of these
        possibilities, namely that renal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> responsiveness
        decreases with age due, at least partially, to hormonal
        changes associated with puberty. As stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, there
        is no precedent in the literature for examination of the
        effect of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> responsiveness, however, the
        coincidental fall in clinically apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX> in adolescents
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] raises the possibility that hormonal
        changes associated with puberty induce a relatively
        Stx-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the kidney.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> were chosen for examination in this
        study because these cell types, at least 
        in vitro , have been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">injured by Stx-1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Mesangial cells were not
        examined since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx-1</ENAMEX> has not been demonstrated to affect
        their viability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Previous studies have separately
        examined the cytotoxic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , HGEC
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , however this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to
        directly compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> sensitivity of these renal cell
        types. These data indicate that, as suggested from the
        previous studies, within the limits of the cell culture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> are the most sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cell types, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEC</ENAMEX> are slightly less sensitive, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGEN</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> orders of magnitude less sensitive
        than either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HGEC</ENAMEX> or HPT. Such differential sensitivity is
        quite interesting, particularly considering that glomerular
        endothelial cell damage is a prominent histologic feature
        in biopsies obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with clinically well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">established HUS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The significance of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> remains, therefore, to be determined. Although
        speculative, it is tempting to propose that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPT</ENAMEX> and HGEC
        may be early targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx-1</ENAMEX> and that this could play a
        role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathophysiologic</ENAMEX> processes that characterize
        renal injury in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUS</ENAMEX>.
        Estrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> or testosterone did not affect
        Stx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal cell cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> or Gb3 expression.
        Cells were exposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to one week</TIMEX> in
        order to allow time for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>-regulated gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and protein expression. In addition, both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> and pharmacologic concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>
        were utilized. Despite these efforts to be insure that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was optimized in order to detect a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>-mediated
        alteration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> responsiveness, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> still exists
        that this system may not really reflect the influences of
        sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> in vivo. Indeed, one might argue that an
        animal model, in which the testes or ovaries are removed
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stx</ENAMEX> in the presence and absence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> replacement, would be better. Such studies
        would, however, be problematic. Traditional animal models,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, rabbits or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pigs</ENAMEX> do not develop typical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX> when given either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stx</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0157</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H7</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Further,
        animal models that most closely reflect human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HUS</ENAMEX> are only
        in the early stages of development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Hence, the cell
        culture system remains the most reasonable means to assess
        an effect of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> on renal cell Stx-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX>; such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have clearly been demonstrated
        to be responsive to sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> (e.g.
        testosterone-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity in proximal
        tubule cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] as well as estrogen-regulated
        endothelial cell function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ). Given these
        limitations, our data suggest that sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> do not
        alter renal cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of
        this Stx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Consequently, the reasons why clinically
        apparent HUS primarily occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> remains to be
        determined.
