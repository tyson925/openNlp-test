        Cystic fibrosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX>) is an autosomal recessive disease
        caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR chloride
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> is known to possess multiple cellular
        functions beyond its role as an apical membrane chloride
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . For example, regulation of other ion
        channels, such as the epithelial sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and the
        outwardly rectified chloride <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, are well-described
        functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Numerous other functions, such
        as regulation of intracellular vesicular pH, regulation of
        membrane recycling, and regulation of mucin exocytosis are
        less firmly established. Phenotypic expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, with multiple organs affected. The disease is
        commonly but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variably</ENAMEX> expressed in the lungs, the exocrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pancreas</ENAMEX>, and the gastrointestinal mucosa [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Significant intestinal malabsorption of various
        substrates, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>, is a consistent finding
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The total bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> pool is contracted
        unless supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is provided.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> losses can be so severe that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid taurine</ENAMEX> can occur due to
        excessive losses of taurine-conjugated bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid malabsorption</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> has been attributed to an
        inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">un-hydrolyzed</NUMEX>, intraluminal
        triglycerides on the intestinal absorption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>.
        However, in several studies the correlation between fecal
        fat excretion and fecal bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> loss could not be
        demonstrated, suggesting that additional factors are
        responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid malabsorption</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . 
        In vitro studies using brush border
        membrane vesicles or bathed tissue samples from patients
        with cystic fibrosis have shown that total ileal bile acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> is diminished [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        The present study was designed to determine if the
        activity and density of the ileal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transporter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> is diminished in heterozygous and homozygous cftr
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX>. The results indicate that bile acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malabsorption</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> is not caused by a defect in
        sodium-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transport at the brush border
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membrane</ENAMEX> suggesting another mechanism is operative.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cftr knockout mice</ENAMEX>, with targeted disruption of the
          cftr gene created at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of North Carolina</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] , were maintained at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Care Facility</ENAMEX> under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UW</ENAMEX> Cystic

          more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 days old</TIMEX> (strain V129Xl<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/SvJ</ENAMEX>) were used,
          including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> homozygous cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> heterozygous cftr
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wild-type cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/+</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had been
          kept on a standard liquid diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peptamen ®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deerfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>)- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> until immediately prior to
          sacrifice. On this diet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed no evidence of
          obstruction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice underwent inhalation</ENAMEX> anesthesia with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> methoxyflurane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metophane ®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallinckrodt</ENAMEX>,
          Mundelein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) for the harvest of the intestines and were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacrificed</ENAMEX> subsequently by cervical dislocation under a
          protocol approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Use</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geno-typing</ENAMEX> was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated from the
          mouse tails. Following isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> by
          standard techniques, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using primers
          specific for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cftr knockout mice</ENAMEX>.
          The primer sets used and the expected size products were
          as follows:
          WT: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAGTGAAGCTGAGACTGTGA/GCATAATCCAAGAAAATTGAG</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1 kb</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGGTTCTTTTTGTCAAGAC/ATCCTCGCCGTCGGGCATGC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 bp</ENAMEX>).
          Wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressed cftr <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by immunoblotting,
          while cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) did not [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> were from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigma</ENAMEX> unless otherwise stated (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> performing the uptake and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> experiments were blinded to the
          results of the geno-typing.
        
        
          Preparation of intestinal segments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized and the abdomen opened. A
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-cm segment of jejunum was resected at the ligament of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treitz</ENAMEX>. The terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cm segment of ileum was removed
          and immediately transferred into 2°C cold mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ringer solution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM CaCl

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 /5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). The intestinal length was
          measured and the tissue cut into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 one</NUMEX>-cm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-cm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-cm segment beginning
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distally</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-cm gut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 cm</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> to ileocecal valve was used for uptake
          experiments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was cut into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cm</NUMEX> pieces.
          These specimens were everted and the intestinal sleeves
          secured onto <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mm</NUMEX> diameter stainless steel rods using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-0
          silk ties as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The distal
          ileal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cm proximal to the ileocecal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">valve</ENAMEX> (immediately adjacent to the tissue used in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> experiments) and the jejunal segments were used
          for immunohistochemistry studies. The ileal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-1</ENAMEX> cm proximal to the ileocecal valve,
          respectively, from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> were pooled and used for
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Uptake measurements
          All uptake measurements were performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1 and 2</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after excision. Samples were randomized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Intestines from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group were exposed to
          an identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radioactive taurocholate solution</ENAMEX> containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodium</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group were exposed to a
          sodium-free taurocholate solution. Mounted tissues were
          preincubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">37°C</ENAMEX> warm, oxygenated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s
          solution. Then rods were suspended with the tissue
          positioned <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 mm</NUMEX> above stirring bars rotating at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> rpm
          and uptake was measured for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min. in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">37°C</ENAMEX> warm,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxygenated Ringer</ENAMEX>'s solution with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM taurocholate. To
          the uptake solutions tracer amounts of radiolabeled
          sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">taurocholate</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">taurocholate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>

          substance not subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>-mediated transport and
          with a very low diffusion coefficient, was added to these
          solutions to account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-radiotracer in the adherent
          fluid. The incubation time was chosen based on validation
          experiments that showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEG equilibrated</ENAMEX> in the
          unstirred layer after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>. In contrast,
          taurocholate uptake rates remained linear for at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> (data not shown).
          To measure Na-independent uptake, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Na</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s
          solution was prepared by replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> with Choline-Cl
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaHCO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> with KHCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Na</ENAMEX>-free solutions,
          taurocholate was added as a potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>.
          Potassium-taurocholate was prepared by ion exchange of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M solution Na-</ENAMEX>taurocholate with potassium-loaded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AmberLyte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biorad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). The potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> was
          subsequently recrystallized. Absence of sodium ions
          following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion exchange</ENAMEX> was confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">flame-photometry.</ENAMEX>
          After incubation, tissues were removed from the rods,
          placed in scintillation vials and solubilized in TS-2
          tissue solubilizer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Products International</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Prospect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). Then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 ml</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Safety-Solve</ENAMEX> scintillation

          appropriate standard spectra and quench curves for the
          dual-labeled samples. Calculations of uptake rates were
          performed as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> and purified by immuno-affinity chromatography as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The ileal tissue segments were
          snap-frozen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX> cold isopentane and then stored in
          -70°C until the tissues were processed. Frozen sequential

          Western blots
          Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared as
          described by deRooij [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, frozen ileal
          tissue fragments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-25</NUMEX> mg) were thawed and homogenized

          decanted into another vial and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The pellet
          was resuspended in buffer and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes this</TIMEX>
          suspension was centrifuged as before. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> supernatant

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,000</NUMEX> × g to spin down the brush border membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μl</NUMEX> of the brush border membrane preparation

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biorad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA) in glycine-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> buffer
          following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s suggestions. Blots were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All data were collected from individual tissues and
          processed as independent data points as well as grouped
          by their origin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cm, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cm from the ileocecal valve,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) Results were expressed as mean +/- standard error
          of the mean (SEM). Comparisons were made between multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and the unpaired student t-test as a
          post-hoc test. Significance was assumed at p <

        Results
        Active rates of taurocholate uptake were twice as high
        in the heterozygous cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>) compared to
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) (average of all data points in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">terminal ileum 109 ± 8</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 ± 13</NUMEX> cm <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pmol/mm 2</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) and fourfold higher in the homozygous cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) mice
        (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">212 ± 32 pmol/mm 2</ENAMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> vs. wild-type).
        Increases occurred similarly at different sites in the
        terminal ileum in locations from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cm to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cm from the
        ileocecal valve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). However, only differences in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> cm reached a level of significance of p
        < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. Differences in rates of passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of
        taurocholate were not statistically significant among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Microscopic morphology of the mucosa was
        similar in the different study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Prior to use for Western blotting, brush border membrane
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vesicle</TIMEX> suspensions were tested for enrichment of brush
        border enzymes and showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold increase of alkaline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 - 11</NUMEX>-fold increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-glucosidase activity using standard methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        On densitometric evaluations of Western blots, IBAT
        concentrations were twice as high in heterozygotes as in
        controls (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 ± 3</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">density units</ENAMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as high in homozygotes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 ± 4</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 ± 1</NUMEX> density
        units; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A similar relationship
        was found in intensity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> immunostaining on
        examinations of microscopic sections treated with anti-IBAT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. The highest increases in signal density were
        noted at the base of the crypts of cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) animals
        (arrow in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These unusual changes were never found
        in any jejunal samples and occurred only occasionally as
        weak signals in ileal samples from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Untreated children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis
        excrete amounts of fecal bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> similar to patients
        with ileal resections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Based on kinetic studies,
        this increased fecal loss appears to be secondary to an
        interrupted enterohepatic circulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        ] . Bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid malabsorption</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis appears to
        be due in part to diminished secretion of pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> and the presence of un-hydrolyzed triglycerides.
        Supplementation with pancreatic enzymes and a low-fat diet
        can markedly reduce the fecal excretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 20 23</NUMEX> ] . Other evidence, however, suggests that a
        diminished capacity of the ileal mucosa for bile acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uptake</ENAMEX> plays a significant role in bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> malabsorption
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis that is independent of
        triglyceride concentrations. Findings supporting this
        notion include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. The absence of a correlation between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fecal fat excretion</ENAMEX> and fecal bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> loss; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fecal bile acid</ENAMEX> losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with liver disease
        compared to excessive losses in those without liver disease
        despite similar fecal fat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">excretion</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The finding
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with almost normal fat excretion continue to
        lose large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX>.
        Based on these findings, a defect in ileal bile acid
        transport mechanisms in cystic fibrosis has been suspected.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> in support of this hypothesis are contradictory.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fondacaro et al.</ENAMEX> bathed ileal biopsies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        taurocholate solutions. They found a decrease in total
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">apical</NUMEX> + basolateral) bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> uptake compared to normal
        controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and hypothesized that bile acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malabsorption</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis was due to a primary
        mucosal defect although they had not specifically studied
        apical, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Na +-dependent absorption</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Rooij et al.</ENAMEX> found
        significant decreases in active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid uptake</ENAMEX> when
        examining ileal brush border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and
        proposed that altered viscosity of the ileal mucus was
        likely not a factor in ileal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> malabsorption
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis. In another study using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> perfusions with taurocholate and glycocholate in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, however, the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> uptake rates with
        cystic fibrosis were similar to control subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The results from our study stand in contrast to these
        earlier studies. We found a significant increase in bile
        acid transport in cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) and cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> function was paralleled by increases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBAT protein</ENAMEX> concentrations. Similar discrepancies between
        measurements of solute uptake with brush border membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> or tissue biopsies and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments have
        been observed in studies examining sodium/glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotransport</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis. Jejunal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> absorption
        was enhanced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis when measured
        with catheter perfusion techniques [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Ussing chamber
        studies of intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> biopsy specimens suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        and alanine uptake rates are markedly increased in cystic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> also studied intact jejunal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biopsies</ENAMEX> and found that the rate of active sodium/glucose
        transport approximately doubled in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> compared to normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jejunum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Contrary to these findings, other investigations have
        been unable to demonstrate any changes in sodium/glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transport when examining brush border membrane vesicles
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The up-regulation of intestinal sodium-linked
        nutrient absorption by cftr may occur via a mechanism that
        does not involve changes of the brush border membrane but
        rather intracellular components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Intestinal
        sodium-linked nutrient absorption would then be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in brush border membrane vesicle studies.
        However, a number of studies using biopsies in Ussing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX> have also been unable to demonstrate enhanced
        glucose absorption in cystic fibrosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        Phenotypic expression is variable in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> carrying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> or heterozygous mutations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> gene. The
        ΔF508 mutation is the most common genetic disturbance
        affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> gene. ΔF508 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> are affected
        to a lesser degree than are homozygotes. In heterozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT/ΔF508</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX>, sweat chloride
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excretion</ENAMEX> is elevated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold over normal values compared
        to a tenfold increase in homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ΔF508/ΔF508</ENAMEX> genotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Adult heterozygous patients
        have fewer problems with respiratory infections compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygotes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Our findings that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> absorption
        was moderately increased in heterozygotes and markedly
        increased in homozygotes were therefore not unexpected.
        Heterozygotes are able to produce a limited number of
        intact, correctly localized CFTR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> molecules
        resulting in partial phenotypic expression. The correlation
        between zygosity and level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBAT protein</ENAMEX> expression
        suggests a close relationship between the function of the
        CFTR chloride <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and the sodium-dependent ileal bile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">acid</ENAMEX> transporter.
        Our study is the first that correlates changes in
        function of another intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">solute</ENAMEX> transporter with the
        expression level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX>. Increased bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transport in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cftr</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is associated with an increase in the
        abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBAT protein</ENAMEX> in the brush border membrane.
        Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> exist in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>. In hamsters,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, increases and decreases in bile acid
        absorption at the brush border membrane are mediated by an
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>- or down-regulation in IBAT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ]
        . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several rodent</TIMEX> species including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> is clearly dependent on intraluminal bile acid
        concentrations and occurs via a negative feedback mechanism
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . Feeding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> suppresses
        transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> mRNA and reduces IBAT protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX>; feeding of the bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binder cholestyramine
        has the opposite effect. In normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, this negative
        feedback mechanism keeps the enterohepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> pool
        in equilibrium. As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acids</ENAMEX> are lost, increased
        absorption by a greater number of transporters, in
        combination with increased hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid synthesis</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, helps restore normal bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> levels. In
        contrast, cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-/-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> may experience bile acid
        malabsorption even though their ileal mucosal cells express
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold more IBAT transporters than normal cells. This
        apparently paradoxical finding would suggest a luminal
        factor that prevents bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from entering the mucosal
        cells in the ileum.
        Based on this evidence, we postulate that the more
        viscous mucus layer in the ileal crypts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        cystic fibrosis limits access of luminal bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micelles</ENAMEX> to the ileal crypt cells. This may result in an
        altered programming of ileal stem cells and transit cells
        that give rise to absorptive enterocytes over-expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBAT protein</ENAMEX>.
        Further investigations are needed to corroborate this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. Additional studies should examine changes in
        mucus layer thickness, mucus viscosity and permeability for
        bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> associated with hetero- and homozygosity for
        CFTR mutations. An alternative mechanism for the
        upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> acts
        as a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX>, as it does for the
        epithelial sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> is a
        sodium-dependent apical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">membrane</ENAMEX> transporter, it might be
        regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX>, as is the epithelial sodium channel
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENaC</ENAMEX>) present in the apical membrane of the ileal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterocyte</ENAMEX>. CFTR regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENaC</ENAMEX> has been described in
        the colon in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cftr knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENaC</ENAMEX> suggests that direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> to closely regulate
        the activity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . Our results
        suggest that knockout of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CFTR</ENAMEX> leads to an analogous
        increase in expression and function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX>. Of course, a
        more widespread perturbation of ion channel regulation in
        the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> is also a possibility, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> has been
        demonstrated to be a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of such diverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na/K</ENAMEX> pump [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , the basolateral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na/K/2</ENAMEX>Cl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transporter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , and the inducible nitric oxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, in the widely studied cftr knockout mouse
        model (which clearly demonstrates intestinal pathology),
        the apical sodium dependent ileal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile acid</ENAMEX> transporter is
        expressed and functions at higher levels than in wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, with intermediate levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> expression and
        function in heterozygous cftr (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The results of
        this study open up further avenues of investigation with
        respect to the role of the mucus layer in causing a
        secondary up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> expression and function. In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBAT</ENAMEX> may be yet another apical membrane transport
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX>.
