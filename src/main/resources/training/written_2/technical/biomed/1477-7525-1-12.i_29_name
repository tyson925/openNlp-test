        New antiretroviral therapies introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX> 1990s
        have allowed many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection to live longer
        before progressing to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and to have longer survival
        following an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> diagnosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number
        of deaths due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> peaked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
        and has since declined [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , resulting in an increase in
        the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prevalent AIDS</ENAMEX> cases. Current clinical
        guidelines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] call for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> to take
        a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medications</ENAMEX> to decrease
        viral load, maintain immune cell function, and prevent the
        development of resistant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. Thus, for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> has evolved more toward a
        model of chronic disease management, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> taking a
        variety of potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> for extended periods of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        Besides clinical outcomes, health-related quality of
        life (HRQOL) and disability are important issues for
        persons treated for chronic diseases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] ,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Populations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> have reported different levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>,
        both in clinical trials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] and
        population-based research [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . We present summary
        information from a multi-site supplemental surveillance
        project that describes the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> reported by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in different demographic and
        behavioral risk factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, stressing the relationship
        between disease progression and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) has conducted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplement</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surveillance</ENAMEX> (SHAS) Project, an ongoing cross-sectional
        interview study designed to collect supplemental behavioral
        surveillance data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Persons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years of age or older</TIMEX> reported with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        through routine case surveillance were eligible for
        participation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were enrolled using one of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> methods: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) facility-based recruitment of all
        eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> seeking treatment at selected health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based recruitment
        of all eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based recruitment of
        a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who have sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (MSM) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of
        all other eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. During the period examined for
        this analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection in
        addition to those with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>. (Three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-opted not to collect data using
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> module and were excluded from all analyses.)
        Informed consent was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> prior
        to the interview, and the study has received institutional
        review board approval at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> and local levels.
        Trained interviewers conducted a standardized interview in
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> that includes questions on
        demographic characteristics, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, sexual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX>, and medical and social service information. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
        are self-reported and are not verified through medical
        record review or clinical tests. On average interviews take
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 45 minutes</TIMEX> to complete. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>
        without any personal identifying information.
        The format of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SHAS</ENAMEX> Project allows the questionnaire
        to be modified to collect data on additional topics of
        interest. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From January 1995 through December 1996</TIMEX>, a module
        of questions adapted from research conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Wu</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] was added to study the levels of
        self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et al</ENAMEX> compiled questions from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAND Medical Outcomes Study</ENAMEX> (MOS) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] as well as
        additional items to measure other dimensions of health
        (energy, distress, and cognitive function) potentially
        relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et al</ENAMEX> found that their modified
        health status questionnaire reliably and distinctly
        measured aspects of health among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive persons
        recruited for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clinical trials of zidovudine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who were asymptomatic had higher
        scores on most HRQOL dimensions-indicating relatively less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disability</ENAMEX> and a better quality of life-than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who
        were diagnosed with early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS Quality of Life</ENAMEX> module was used to collect
        information on self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> in the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overall Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physical Functioning</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Role Functioning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Functioning, Mental Health</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy/Fatigue</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cognitive Functioning</ENAMEX>. These eight
        HRQOL dimensions were measured using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> questions (a subset
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> MOS questions used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et al</ENAMEX>). Response scores
        for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> dimension were transformed linearly on scale
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 100</TIMEX>. Multi-item dimensions were scored by summing
        item responses, and internal consistency coefficients
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronbach</ENAMEX>'s alpha [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ) were calculated. For each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimension</ENAMEX>, lower scores indicate relatively lower
        self-perceived quality of life for that health measure
        compared to higher scores.
        Analysis of variance tests were used to compare crude
        mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> across demographic and behavioral
        categories; because the sample was large the significance
        level for univariate analysis was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>.
        Multivariate linear regression (least-squares means) was
        used to identify independent factors associated with HRQOL
        in the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>; analyses included variables
        noted from the literature as potentially associated with
        quality of life (e.g., age, sex, education, and income).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were then constructed using the
        separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> dimension scores as the outcomes; here, the
        significance level was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. Tukey-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramer</ENAMEX>
        adjustments for multiple comparisons were used where
        appropriate. Age and education were included in the models
        as continuous predictor variables; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count, gender,
        income, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity, mode of exposure, time known to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>+, currently taking antiretroviral therapy (yes versus
        no), and type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS</ENAMEX> recruitment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility-based</ENAMEX>) were included as categorical predictor
        variables. To simplify comparisons across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> dimensions,
        we report results for models including all predictor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, regardless of whether any individual variable
        was predictive of the outcome. All analyses were conducted
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 6.12</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Results
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From January 1995 through December 1996, 6128</TIMEX> persons
        were identified for interview at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> that
        administered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> module. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">614</NUMEX> were found to
        have died before they could be contacted. Of the remaining
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5514, 4246</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.0%</NUMEX>) completed SHAS interviews, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4%</NUMEX>)
        refused to participate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">394</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.1%</NUMEX>) could not be located,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">353</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4%</NUMEX>) were located but were too ill (either
        physically or mentally) to participate. Sites phased out
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> module at various times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-year</TIMEX>
        period; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> data were available from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3778</TIMEX> interviews.
        Persons administered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> module were demographically
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who did not participate in SHAS
        (refused, could not be located, or too ill), except that a
        slightly higher percentage of those who did not participate
        were male (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76.0%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.5%</NUMEX>) and white (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40.5%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.0%</NUMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> test of proportions, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        The multi-item HRQOL dimensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physical Functioning</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Role Functioning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy/Fatigue</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cognitive Functioning</ENAMEX> were internally consistent in our
        sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronbach</ENAMEX>'s alpha â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 0.84</NUMEX>).
        Demographic characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> module
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The median age of those
        providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> information was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</TIMEX> (range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-84</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> had been diagnosed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81.1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70.9%</NUMEX> had
        known of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> or more, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.0%</NUMEX> were currently taking any antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
        (i.e., zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">experimental HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX>). The
        population mean score on the dimension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overall Health</ENAMEX>
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50.4</NUMEX> (on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 100</NUMEX>).
        Mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> scores were stratified across demographic and
        behavioral categories and compared by using the analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, lower Overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> scores
        were associated with older age, female sex, black or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV exposure</ENAMEX> through injection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> count, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 12 years</TIMEX> of education,
        no private health insurance, and lower income. Mean scores
        for each of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> dimensions were also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX> and similarly compared by demographic
        characteristics. In most instances in which significant
        differences were found, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> was associated with the
        factors already listed (data not displayed).
        In linear regression analyses, lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> count, less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, lower income, and older <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> were consistently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with lower HRQOL scores. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the HRQOL
        scores stratified by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count adjusted for the other
        predictor variables, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Least Squares Means</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> labeled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">CD4 Unknown</ENAMEX>" includes those
        who never had a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> test as well as those who had a CD4
        test but could not recall the result). On all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        the HRQOL measures, self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> decreased as CD4
        count decreased. CD4 count was not associated with the
        measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health and Cognitive Function</ENAMEX>.
        We were also interested in the relationship between
        antiretroviral therapy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>. Most of the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.0%</NUMEX>) was currently taking antiretroviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>. Taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medication</ENAMEX> differed
        significantly by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75.1%</NUMEX> of those with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><200</NUMEX> were currently taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medication</ENAMEX>,
        compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.5%</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200-499</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.3%</NUMEX>
        with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â‰¥</ENAMEX> 500 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mantel Hantzel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> test for trend). In univariate analysis, current
        antiretroviral therapy was associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> HRQOL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>: therapy was negatively associated with Role
        Function and positively associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health</ENAMEX>. For
        the dimension of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Role Function</ENAMEX>, currently taking
        antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> was associated with a lower HRQOL
        score (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44.3</NUMEX>) than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> not currently taking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medication</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49.8</NUMEX>; P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). However, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multivariate</ENAMEX> models examining HRQOL scores stratified by
        CD4 count, currently taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medication</ENAMEX> was
        not associated with differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disability</ENAMEX> and health-related quality of life are
        becoming increasingly important issues associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. New developments in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> have
        produced dramatic improvements in the clinical and
        immunologic health for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with a resulting
        reduction in deaths due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Along
        with clinical indicators of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality,
        measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> (such as physical functioning, mental
        health, pain, and energy) can help guide treatment
        decisions for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>.
        Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, we found that lower HRQOL scores
        and poorer perception of health were associated with more
        advanced disease. A majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> diagnosis at the time of their interview. However,
        a broad range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> levels is represented in the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Both facility-based and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based
        strategies were used to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> included large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        racial/ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        through injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use or heterosexual risk. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have not been extensively reported in previous
        studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have
        been more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of white male clinic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Where significant differences were found
        by univariate analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> through injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use had
        lower mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> scores. However, in multivariate linear
        regression, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection risk
        were not associated with differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> when
        stratified by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count.
        Several limitations should be considered in the
        interpretation of our findings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS</ENAMEX> is a cross-sectional
        interview study with data self-reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>.
        Critical indicators of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, such as CD4
        count, were not confirmed through clinical testing or
        review of medical records. Among those who reported having
        ever had a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX> could not recall the most
        recent <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count; on most HRQOL dimensions their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> lay
        between the scores for the lowest and middle CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        This finding suggests they were more advanced in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>; indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.6%</NUMEX> were reported to the national
        surveillance system as having <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>. The SHAS questionnaire
        also did not adequately capture the composition of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s past and current antiretroviral therapies, or the
        duration of, and adherence to, those therapies.
        Specifically, this questionnaire does not assess the
        effects of protease inhibitor therapy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX>, as those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> were introduced during the period the HRQOL
        module was used. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> taking antiretroviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> at the time of interview, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 39</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6%</NUMEX>)
        reported taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Although other studies
        have also reported that questions adapted from the MOS
        discriminated differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] , the SHAS questionnaire's shorter
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-item subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOS</ENAMEX> questions may limit direct
        comparison of our results with those of other studies.
        Still, our findings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRQOL</ENAMEX> analysis in SHAS
        generally agree with those in other published research.
        Quality of life issues are also important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> as they relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication adherence</ENAMEX>. Complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication regimens</ENAMEX> and side effects can affect both
        quality of life and adherence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">viral strains</ENAMEX> may emerge when adherence to antiretroviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> is suboptimal. After the initial HRQOL module was
        used, the SHAS questionnaire was modified to include
        questions on use of past and current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (including
        protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>), duration of current therapies,
        measures of adherence, and reasons for lack of adherence.
        These questions should provide valuable new data on the
        relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, therapy, and HRQOL
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAS Project</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The evolution toward treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX> as a
        chronic illness presents additional challenges for patients
        and clinicians. Measures of health-related quality of life
        can provide important information to behavioral and
        clinical studies of antiretroviral treatment, adherence,
        and viral resistance - factors that ultimately influence
        HIV-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality.
