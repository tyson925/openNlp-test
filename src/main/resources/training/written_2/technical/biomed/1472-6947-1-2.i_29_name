        With the rising trend towards consumerism in health,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are increasingly encouraged to become involved in
        making decisions about their health. Marketing campaigns
        for prescription drugs are now being directed towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with advertisements appearing in the popular
        press suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and
        treatment options with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. A recent study
        examining the effect of drug advertisements on consumer
        behavior found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> asked for a
        prescription, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> asked a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> for information
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> after seeing a drug advertisement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In
        order for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to be effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the
        decision making process, they need information on the
        effects of treatment on their health risks that they can
        use to make health care decisions. The challenge to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> is how to present risk information to patients
        that they can use in a format that they prefer.
        Several studies have examined how presentation, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX>
        ] wording, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and framing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
        interpretations of numeric data as well as their
        willingness to initiate treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, few
        studies have examined the effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of framing
        risk data with different metrics, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> or
        absolute risk and the number needed to treat (NNT).
        Relative risk describes the ratio of the risk of disease in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to that in another and does not take
        into consideration a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s baseline risk. Absolute risk
        describes the difference between the risks of disease in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and varies according to baseline risk. A
        derivative of absolute risk is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> with a specific
        therapy to prevent one adverse outcome (the inverse of the
        difference in absolute risk). Framing the benefits of
        treatment in relative rather than absolute terms may
        emphasize the short-term benefits of a treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Conversely, framing the risks of treatment in relative
        rather than absolute terms may emphasize its risks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Comparing relative and absolute risk reduction and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> as
        methods to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> about preventive therapies, Hux
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> illustrated that the metric used to present data can
        affect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s perception of a therapy's effectiveness
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        In addition to consideration of which metric is used to
        describe risks, the time horizon over which risks or
        benefits occur may affect risk interpretation. Typically,
        risks framed in relative terms are not explicit about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> frame involved and may be erroneously interpreted as
        accruing immediately. On the other hand, risks framed in
        absolute terms or as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> tend to report a specific time
        frame and hence may be interpreted as being delayed in
        onset. In addition to issues related to comprehension,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may prefer to have risks presented over specific
        time periods.
        While most framing studies focused on a treatment's
        effect on a single outcome over a single time horizon,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> often need to decide on treatments that affect
        multiple outcomes, both beneficial and harmful. For
        example, the decision of whether or not to use hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause involves weighing
        the benefits of treatment (immediate symptom relief, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        decreased future risk of hip fracture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and possible
        decreased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] )
        against its risks (increased future risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] ). Framing effects appear to be smaller when both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> and harmful effects of a treatment are included,
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] but little information is available to guide
        clinicians about how to explain complex risk information to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Most studies exploring risk communication and
        decision-making have focused on the use of different
        metrics. However, data can be described using a variety of
        different graphical formats as well. Survival curves are
        commonly used in the scientific literature and can also be
        used to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> understand risk information when
        deciding between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Figures using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        faces or ovals to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with and without a
        condition, displayed in a random [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] or consolidated [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] fashion, have gained increasing popularity in the lay
        press, as have simple bar charts.
        The choice of graphical formats may affect patient
        performance on cognitive tests, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] accuracy
        of comprehension, and speed of processing probabilistic
        information. Vertical bars, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">horizontal bars</ENAMEX>, numbers, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> consolidated ovals performed better than either pie
        charts or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> random ovals when testing simplified
        cognitive tasks (e.g., identifying the larger of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        quantities) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The type of visual graphic used to
        present information can also introduce bias in risk
        perception, with risk perceived to be less when using a bar
        graph versus a stick figure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Numerous criteria have been used to evaluate graphical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formats</ENAMEX>, including clarity, helpfulness, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] accuracy
        and efficiency, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] though these criteria may not
        necessarily be those of greatest importance to patients
        themselves. Although it is unclear which criteria should be
        used to evaluate formats to use with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, patient
        preferences may be an important consideration. Formats
        preferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may reflect higher perceived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relevance</ENAMEX>, familiarity, usefulness, usability, and
        meaningfulness, and hence may be more successful in
        engaging their attention. The aim of this study is to
        determine patient preferences for the presentation of
        complex benefit/risk information describing the impact of
        treatment on multiple clinical outcomes over multiple time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizons</ENAMEX>, including preferences for graphic format,time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizons</ENAMEX>, multiple outcomes comparisons, and metrics. The
        specific example tested was deciding on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> among a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of peri-and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Graphic format
          We identified the following graphic formats as being
          the most commonly used in the scientific and popular
          press, and therefore the most recognizable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>:
          bar graphs, line graphs, thermometer graphs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative faces</ENAMEX> displayed in a consolidated fashion,
          and survival curves (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The survival curve
          was atypical in that its y-axis presented a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          chance of not developing a disease instead of the more
          standard "chance of survival". This modification was made
          to keep the data presented consistent with data presented
          in the other graphical formats since survival was not
          presented in the other graphs (the chance of not
          developing a disease is the closest equivalent to
          survival, which is the chance of not dying). Pie charts
          were not included because this format did not readily
          lend itself to describing risks over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>

          were sequentially presented with all graphic formats and
          each was briefly explained. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were asked to
          rate how much they liked each graph on a likert scale of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 5</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponding to "not at all" and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          corresponding to "extremely", and then to rank order the
          graphs according to preference.
        
        
          Time horizons
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were also asked to rank order their
          preferences for risk estimates over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX>, or
          lifetime horizons, presented using bar graphs predicting
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s risk for developing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, hip fracture
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Multiple Outcomes</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>' preferences for risk displays about
          multiple clinical outcomes were elicited by asking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to choose between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> graphs. In Set
          A, each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> diseases was displayed separately over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          time horizons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set B</ENAMEX>, the same three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> were displayed together over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one time</TIMEX> horizon;
          this was repeated for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> time horizons (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Note that the exact same data were presented in each
          set, differing only in format.
        
        
          Metrics
          Preferences for absolute vs. relative risk estimates
          were obtained by asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to choose between
          risk estimates for heart disease framed in either
          absolute or relative terms, both graphically and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textually</ENAMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> evaluated the concept of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NNT</ENAMEX> presented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> written explanations. The first
          explanation (referred to as "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in x") was worded "If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> just like you took lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX>, it would prevent
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> from having <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> took
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifelong HRT</ENAMEX>, it would prevent one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> from having a
          hip fracture. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> took lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX>, it would
          cause one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. There is no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of knowing in advance who these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> might be." The
          alternative explanation (referred to as "x out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>")
          was worded "If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> just like you were to take
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifelong HRT</ENAMEX>, treatment would prevent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of them from
          developing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of them from developing a
          hip fracture. However, treatment would cause <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of them to
          develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. There is no way of knowing in
          advance who these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> might be."
          We assessed differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' preferences
          between the two graphs with the highest mean rating using
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> signed-rank test. Descriptive statistics were
          performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> stratified according to race
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> vs. non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> household income
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><$50,000</NUMEX> vs.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>‰¥<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>), and education (<2 years
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â‰¥</ENAMEX> 2 years college). Statistical comparisons
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> were not performed due to the small
          sample size.
        
      
      
        Results
        Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> included a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> peri-
        and post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Half of our sample
        identified themselves as non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        had at least some high school education; most (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) had an
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> household income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $50,000</NUMEX>.
        The mean preference rating for the bar graph exceeded
        those of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other graphs in this set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>) ranked the bar graph as being their first
        or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most preferred graph, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) selecting the bar graph as their first
        choice (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> graph was consistently rated
        highest when the sample <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was stratified according
        to race, income and educational status. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sub-group</ENAMEX> analyses
        are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, recognizing that these analyses are
        limited considering the small sample size.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> preferred receiving risk estimates over
        multiple time horizons vs. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time point. When asked to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prioritize</ENAMEX>, a majority preferred receiving lifetime risk
        estimates instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 or 20-year</TIMEX> time horizons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        3a). There was no clear preference for the type of
        presentation comparing risks for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple disease</ENAMEX> outcomes
        over different time horizons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3b</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Respondents</ENAMEX>
        preferred risk estimates framed in absolute rather than
        relative terms for both graphical and textual displays
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3c</ENAMEX>); this finding was consistent across racial,
        income, and educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
        consistently stated that they wanted graphical and textual
        explanations of absolute risks provided together. In
        describing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> preferred the written
        explanation which rescaled data from "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-in x" to "x out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3d</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Limitations
          The present study included a small, self-selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were more likely to be interested
          in health-related activities. Our sample size was small
          because focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-on-1 interviews were
          originally conducted to discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> and decision-making
          issues. When convergence was reached on these broader
          topics, we ceased recruitment and analyzed data from
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. While these results may not be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizable</ENAMEX> to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, our sample included a diverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with respect to race, income, and
          educational background. Recognizing that focus group
          discussions might lead to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> think", we control for
          this by asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to privately write down their
          personal preferences before they were discussed.
          A formal analysis of patient comprehension for each
          presentation format was beyond the scope of the present
          study; however data on this topic has been previously
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . While responses from focus group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reflected how well they felt they could
          understand the information in various formats, no formal
          testing of comprehension was performed. Analyzing
          comprehension of each format at this stage was not
          feasible considering the additional time burden it would
          have imposed on our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (focus group
          sessions lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a full 2 hours</TIMEX>). Presentation formats
          that are not understandable may be misinterpreted;
          formats that are unappealing may be ignored. Therefore,
          future studies might test both comprehension and patient
          preferences simultaneously to develop future risk
          communication tools.
          The graphical presentations utilized were hypothetical
          in that they did not present each individual's personal
          risk estimates, but those of a theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. It is
          unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' preferences for risk estimate
          presentations would have been different had they been
          shown their own risk estimates. Not all possible graph
          types were presented to study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, although we
          attempted to include the most common graph types from the
          scientific and popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>. Although we did not
          systematically study the reasons for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' stated
          preferences, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were asked open-ended questions
          to understand these preferences. Finally, since
          scientific literature traditionally presents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-year
          survival data, it might be difficult to compare our data,
          based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> and lifetime horizons, to that
          in the current literature.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> preferred health risks to be framed in absolute
        terms, using bar graphs, and calculated over their expected
        lifetime. There was no clear preference for presenting a
        treatment's effect on multiple outcomes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNT</ENAMEX> is not an
        easily understood concept for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but if used to
        discuss multiple outcomes, it should be re-scaled to "x out

        a clear and useful manner.
