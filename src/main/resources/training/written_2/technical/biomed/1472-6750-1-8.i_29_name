        Comparative gene expression using microarrays plays an
        increasingly important role in analysis of biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> mechanisms, phenotyping, cell classification, and a
        variety of other applications (see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , for review).
        There are now several commercial purveyors of microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> and reagents, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that perform
        experiments on a contract basis. The output of microarray
        experiments typically consists of intensity measurements
        that are manipulated by scaling, background subtraction and
        other correction procedures, the details of which are often
        proprietary. In the case of experiments performed by
        contract, computer files are returned to the customer which
        contain lists of sequences, matched intensities and, in
        some instances, intensity ratios compared to internal
        references.
        Representation of intensity data as ratios has
        considerable value for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. Seldom are absolute
        levels of mRNA expression of interest. Rather, the relative
        changes in expression of individual genes between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        samples are more informative. But the use of ratios to
        characterize differences may have drawbacks. For example,
        estimates of significance are more difficult to determine.
        In addition, potential improvements in estimates of high
        signals compared to low signals may not be adequately
        represented by a ratio. Thus, a conservative evaluation of
        confidence levels is called for, limiting useful
        information that may be extracted from the intensity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> approaches that rely on signal subtraction
        may have certain advantages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Variances for such
        difference values are the sums of the variances for the
        individual measurements. Therefore, a simple, general
        method to estimate variance at specific signal intensities
        may permit more effective data analysis. In the absence of
        replicates, the intensity distributions for individual
        genes (and, therefore, the distribution mean (μ) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">variance (σ 2</ENAMEX>)) are unknown. For an experiment that
        examines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hybridizations that involve the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        sample, each gene is matched with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intensities, 
        S1 and 
        S2 . The μ's for the distributions of
        each 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> are not known and range widely,
        reflecting low or high gene expression. However, for
        properly handled data, μ for the difference, 
        S1 - 
        S2 = Δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> , should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately zero</NUMEX> for
        all intensity levels. If the intensities are distributed
        normally, then the Δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distribution</ENAMEX> can be used in
        principle to determine σ 2for a given signal (σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) because σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= σ 
        Δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S  2/2</ENAMEX>; that is, the variance of
        the difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical distributions is twice the
        variance of the individual function.
        Here we present results from investigation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        commercial microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> system and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte Genomics</ENAMEX> system. We show that the control data
        for both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, after proprietary manipulation
        procedures, are well behaved using some statistical
        measures. We further show that intensity differences can be
        used to supply variance estimates of these differences in a
        simple way, without the need for multiple replicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>. These variances can be applied to non-control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to estimate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values for specific changes in gene
        expression. The method described here is intended to
        supplement more elaborate analytical procedures that depend
        on larger numbers of independent observations.
      
      
        Results
        
          Reproducibility of intensity measurements
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> were examined independently and all
          comparisons were limited to datasets within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one</NUMEX> platform.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogastor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were used;
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> experiments, human HEK293 cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (see
          Methods). Intensity measurements from the mRNA samples
          were analyzed using the data provided by the commercial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; no scaling or background subtraction was
          performed other than the proprietary modifications to
          intensities carried out prior to distribution of the
          files to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>.
          To investigate the general properties of the data, the
          intensities from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent experiments using the
          same control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> ( 
          S1 and 
          S2 ) were plotted (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1, 2</ENAMEX>). In
          both cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incyte</ENAMEX>, the data fit a
          straight line with slope approximately equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and
          intercept near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Thus, the data produced by both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX> were judged to be well behaved, with no obvious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skewing</ENAMEX> or bias in the expression measurements.
        
        
          Distributions of intensity differences
          To analyze data scatter in a different way,
          intensities of the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> within each data type
          were subtracted from one another and the differences ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1-S2</ENAMEX> ) were graphed as a histogram
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 4</ENAMEX>). As expected from the intensity plots in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the differences in each dataset were
          distributed as a bell-shaped curve with a mean near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
          The histograms revealed some outliers, suggesting
          possible divergence from the normal distribution.
          However, at least some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outliers</ENAMEX> resulted from
          the non-continuous distribution of signal intensities in
          the datasets. Standard deviations of each histogram were
          different, probably due to differences in the detection
          methods, scaling, etc. used by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However,
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histogram</ENAMEX> had general attributes of a Gaussian
          distribution (e.g., area as a function of 
          z value (where 
          z = ( 
          x - μ) /σ; not shown). Because a
          sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussians</ENAMEX> is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaussian</ENAMEX>, this finding was
          consistent with normally distributed individual intensity
          measurements.
        
        
          Variance of intensity difference as a function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity
          In many cases, measurement accuracies (and the
          signficance of individual measurements) are related in a
          straightforward way to the magnitude of the signal.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photon</ENAMEX> counts are such a case, and it is expected that
          higher signal strengths (intensities) should have smaller
          percentage errors compared to weaker signals. If such
          measurement errors could be estimated, confidence values
          could be calculated for specific differences.
          To obtain such estimates, an average intensity was
          calculated for each signal pair (= ( 
          S1+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2</NUMEX> )<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>). The averaged
          intensities were sorted in descending rank order and were
          averaged again, using a sliding window with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          consecutive values incremented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position at a time.
          The matching differences (Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) were also grouped in sets of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> in the same way. However, instead of averaging, the Δ
          
          S sets were used to compute σ 
          Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S  2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plots</ENAMEX> revealed the
          relationship between the intensity and σ 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
           <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(=σ 
          Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S  2/2; Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). To these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plots</ENAMEX>, various curves were fitted, including polynomials
          and straight lines, and goodness-of-fit values (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2)
          calculated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> fits to the signal vs. σ 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
           2data did not produce acceptable approximations to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.789</NUMEX>). However, quadratic and
          cubic polynomials fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data reasonably well (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>). A linear equation fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data
          well (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.943</NUMEX>), but visual inspection revealed a poor
          fit at lower intensities; thus a quadratic was used. Such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polynomials</ENAMEX> provided a means to estimate σ 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
           <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and hence, 
          z values for each difference.
          Notably, it was important to use data spanning the entire
          relevant intensity range; extrapolation from low
          intensity data to high-intensity data did not give
          reliable results (not shown). Functions were also fit to
          plots of average signal vs. σ 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
           . These plots suggested that the scatter in the data
          increased at a rate intermediate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between σ and σ 2</NUMEX>, with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data more closely approximating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionality</ENAMEX> to σ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2than</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data (not
          shown).
          The fine structure of the signal vs. variance plots
          was also interesting. In both cases the plots were noisy,
          though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data was smoother than the Incyte
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Fine-structure patterns were not preserved among
          different experiments using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and, therefore,
          probably do not reflect any fundamental trend for a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platform</ENAMEX> (see Discussion). Quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data was
          arguably poorer than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data, based on the
          analysis of signal vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ 2</NUMEX>. However, other Incyte
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX> displayed smoother behavior, though the general
          form of the intensity vs. σ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2data</ENAMEX> was similar (see
          Discussion).
        
        
          Application of the method
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> described above was applied to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment designed to compare gene expression
          in human cells harboring either a cadherin-derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cad5CD</NUMEX>) of the β-catenin pathway, or a
          dominant-negative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Tcf inhibitor</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TcfDN</ENAMEX>) of the pathway [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The biological interpretation of the results will
          be presented elsewhere (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamb</ENAMEX>, unpublished).
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample was compared to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (made
          from cells without expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>) used in the
          analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Incyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> described above. Plots of
          all single dye intensity combinations were fit well by
          unit slope lines through the origin (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), and
          the Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">histogram</ENAMEX> was approximately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> (not shown), suggesting reasonable data quality.
          No dramatic differences in gene expression were detected;
          the single largest ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2.3</NUMEX>-fold compared to
          the control. 
          z values for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cad5CD</NUMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TcfDN - Control</ENAMEX> were compared, using σ computed from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic polynomial</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A. All measurements with
          low averages (( 
          S1+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2</NUMEX> )<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">/2 < 400</NUMEX>), corresponding
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20%</NUMEX> of the total dataset were excluded.
          Comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> using the
          difference-averaging method described above yielded many
          more significant differences than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s
          suggested ratio threshold (intensity ratio < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.7</NUMEX> or
          > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For the application of the difference
          averaging method, | 
          z | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX> (corresponding to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX> for normally
          distributed data) was chosen as cutoff. All the ratio
          outliers, with a single exception that had low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> in both experiments, were also present in the
          set of sequences selected based on 
          z . The biological relevance of
          this set of selected points was suggested by inclusion of
          a gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclinD1</TIMEX>, known to be down-regulated by
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TcfDN</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . This gene ( 
          z < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.4</NUMEX>) displayed only a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-fold suppression compared to the control, but its
          high measured intensities pushed it over the limit for
          significance using the signal difference-averaging
          method. Furthermore, for all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the sequences
          selected by | 
          z | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX>, the sign of the
          difference was the same in both datasets, as expected
          based on the biological actions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
          Ratios <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> were deemed significant for | 
          z | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX> (not shown). Such low
          ratios may have biological significance, especially
          considering the steep dose/response of many signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments provide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population-</ENAMEX>averaged rather than single-cell measurements
          of mRNA changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In using intensity ratios for comparison of gene
        expression levels, a choice must be made about data
        presentation. In particular, it is necessary to confront a
        mathematical problem inherent in expression ratios.
        Consider a comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>, A and B, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> intensity values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and b 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . If, after background subtraction,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (b 
        i ) is undetectable while a 
        i yields a measurable signal, then a 
        i / b 
        i approaches infinity. Moreover, for a 
        i > b 
        i , a 
        i / b 
        i > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; but for a 
        i < b 
        i , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0 <</NUMEX> a 
        i / b 
        i < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, resulting in an asymmetric
        representation of comparative intensity values. These
        situations can be rectified in arbitrary ways; for
        instance, by setting backgrounds to a non-zero value and
        using a logarithm transform of the ratio. Alternatively,
        introduction of a discontinuity along with sign/ratio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inversion</ENAMEX> (e.g., for a 
        i > b 
        i , use a 
        i / b 
        i ; for a 
        i < b 
        i , use -b 
        i / a 
        i ) solves the problem. Such
        considerations do not arise if intensity differences are
        used.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> have been developed to analyze
        microarray data both in the private and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>.
        Some attention has been devoted to the problem of
        estimating backgrounds, scaling data for dataset merging,
        and determining statistical significance of intensity
        differences or ratios. The most sophisticated published
        treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of significance use Bayesian
        probability methods, maximum likelihood procedures, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">multiparameter</ENAMEX> fitting to analyze samples of gene
        expression data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . As pointed out by others, the
        lack of replicates of individual sequence intensities
        blocks the most direct route to estimates of variance.
        However, certain statistical treatments can provide
        estimates for the means and variances of small numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ) within microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>. However, collection of even a few repeats can be
        technically impractical or prohibitively expensive.
        Nevertheless, repetition is the most reliable way to
        collect statistical information and the strategy described
        here is intended to supplement, not replace, such
        replication experiments.
        The method of microarray data analysis presented here is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platform-independent</ENAMEX> and can be used to explore data
        quality and to estimate variances. The calculated variances
        provide a statistical basis for interpreting significance
        of intensity differences. The relationship between
        intensity values ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ) and σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         2is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">discerned</ENAMEX> using an averaging procedure that groups
        sets of points of related intensities to estimate σ 
        Δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S  2</ENAMEX>, and hence, σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The use of all data together to fit a function
        argues for a high degree of robustness in the procedure
        that should resist fluctuations in the intensity
        measurements caused by noise. Furthermore, local averaging
        of intensity differences and calculation of σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         2coupled with a global data fit provides the most
        reliable estimates for σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         2as a function of signal, assuming that variance is
        mainly a result of signal intensity and is not otherwise
        sequence-specific. The general smoothness of the plots
        supports this view. Within a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, the σ 2plots
        have similar general shapes that can be fitted well by low
        order polynomials. Higher order polynomials yield better R
        2values, but are probably not justified due to the noise in
        the data. A general function is desired, not one that fits
        the idiosyncratic noise in a specific pairwise comparison.
        Despite its presumed robustness, the difference-averaging
        method is expected to perform better with higher quality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> as input.
        The estimators derived from this type of analysis can be
        used to evaluate the significance of intensity differences
        in non-control datasets, because they relate the magnitude
        of the intensity value, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> , reported in the data file to the
        standard deviation of an intensity distribution with μ = 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). For example, a given pair
        of signals corresponding to measurements for one sequence
        (e.g., a gene) can be compared statistically by computing
        the variance for each signal using the function derived
        from the fitted data (e.g., a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic polynomial</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        The variance of the difference ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1-S2</ENAMEX> ) is simply <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">σ1 2</NUMEX>+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">σ2 2</NUMEX>. The
        observation that distributions of intensity differences
        were approximately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> in form suggests that 
        z values may provide reliable
        estimates for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX> are
        required. In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dye experimental platforms
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incyte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inter-</ENAMEX>chip variances can be estimated in
        the manner shown here. Intra-chip variances can be
        estimated in a similar way, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dyes on a single
        chip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inter-</ENAMEX>chip estimators for σ 2provide a
        conservative statistical measure of significance if applied
        to inter-chip experiments and provide a justification for
        determining significance of differences in merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX>.
        Due to its simplicity, the approach does not require a
        sophisticated understanding of statistical principles.
        Furthermore, the entire analytical procedure can be
        performed inside a spreadsheet application such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microarray platforms</ENAMEX> tested here use different
        types of sequence on the chip. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> employs sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> to interrogate a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> uses
        a single spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of substantially greater length. In
        contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data, the final intensity measurement in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> case is a function of individual intensities
        derived from the oligonucleotides. The data from Affymetrix
        chips were, at least superficially, well behaved. The data
        from both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte's</ENAMEX>, appear to include
        noise other than the counting statistics type. The scatter
        does not scale with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ 2</NUMEX>. This behavior was not restricted
        to the dataset that was the principal subject of the
        present study; all other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Incyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX> analyzed,
        including those with a much smoother appearance, displayed
        similar dependence (not shown). Such noise may originate
        from variability in the spotting or detection.
        There are some peculiarities in both datasets regarding
        the fine structure of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> vs. σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         2plots (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 5, 6</ENAMEX>). In particular, there are
        positions where sudden discontinuities arise. The
        explanation for some of these jumps may involve outliers;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, single poorly measured array points. However, in many
        cases the jumps were inconsistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> aberrant
        measurements that might produce spikes in the averaged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Rather, the jumps resulted from a stable change in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> vs. σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, causing an abrupt transition to a new level,
        discernible as a sudden offset in the scatter plot data. It
        is noteworthy that plots of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> vs. σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(as in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Figs. 5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) do not display the same fine
        structure features, though they all are of similar general
        form (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9for</TIMEX> another example). For instance, the
        large jump at intensity ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX> visible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Awas not as
        dramatic in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Incyte</ENAMEX> datasets. The origin of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX> is not clear.

      
      
        Conclusion
        We have presented a simple analytical approach based on
        differences in signal intensities and averaging for
        analysis of microarray data which can be performed without
        advanced statistics or specialized software. This procedure
        provides insight into the properties of the data under
        consideration, as well as estimates of variances as a
        function of signal strength. Application of the method
        gives statistical support for a more aggressive
        interpretation of microarray intensity data.

          Software
          All analytical procedures and graphing was performed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; no other software packages or

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          A basic summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chip data is
          provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; similar information was not
          available for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> files were imported into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' internal controls were removed.
          Intensity differences for pairs of control signals ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1-S2</ENAMEX> ) were calculated, as well as
          average signals for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (( 
          S1+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2</NUMEX> )<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>). These columns were
          sorted on average signal in descending order and
          averaging window sizes were tested. After settling on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points as the window, an averaged (

          each time was calculated along with σ and σ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2for</TIMEX> the

          averaging process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polynomials</ENAMEX> and lines were fit to
          plots of avg. (
