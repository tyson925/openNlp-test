        Soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugars</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and sucrose, have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated</ENAMEX> to act as signaling molecules that help regulate
        a wide variety of plant developmental and physiological
        processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . These
        processes include flowering [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , seed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germination</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] and photosynthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . One
        of the most thoroughly characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-regulated
        processes is the breakdown of starch by germinating cereal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>. Starch metabolism by germinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> must be
        tightly controlled to ensure an adequate supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> to
        the developing seedling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 23</NUMEX> ] .
        As alpha-amylases play a critical role in starch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, the regulation of alpha-amylase activity has
        formed a major focus of studies on starch metabolism.
        Increasing sugar levels have been shown to repress
        expression of alpha-amylases in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice seedlings</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and
        suspension culture cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Studies using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX>
        embryos provide evidence for the existence of independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and disaccharide signaling mechanisms in the
        regulation of alpha-amylase expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Sugar
        regulation of alpha-amylase expression has also been shown
        to occur at multiple levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar</ENAMEX> levels affect not only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-amylase transcript levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , but also mRNA
        stability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] and protein transport and turnover [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar</ENAMEX>-signaling pathways may also interact with other
        signaling pathways in the control of alpha-amylase
        activity. For example, sugars repress a
        gibberellin-dependent pathway for alpha-amylase expression
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley embryos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Little is known about the signal transduction pathways
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> responses. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins postulated</ENAMEX> to act in control
        of at least some sugar-regulated processes include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexokinases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SNF1</NUMEX>-related protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . Hexokinases have been suggested to play
        a role in sugar repression of alpha-amylase activity. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is based on findings that only those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        analogs that are believed to be substrates for
        phosphorylation by hexokinases are effective in repressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-amylase expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . However, the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexokinases</ENAMEX> in sugar responses remains under debate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] .
        Genetic approaches are being used to identify additional
        components of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-response pathways. Arabidopsis mutants
        that are defective in sugar-regulated expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding patatin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , beta-amylase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plastocyanin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ApL3</NUMEX> subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>-glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrophosphorylase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] have been isolated. Additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-response mutants have been identified by taking
        advantage of the fact that high concentrations of exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sugars</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or sucrose) inhibit early seedling
        development of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        Arabidopsis mutants that are resistant to the inhibitory
        effects of high sugar concentrations have been isolated [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Characterization of these mutants
        reveals that the 
        sis5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , 
        sun6 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] , 
        gin6 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] and 
        isi3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are allelic to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abscisic acid</ENAMEX> insensitive mutant 
        abi4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] and the 
        sis4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , 
        isi4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] and 
        gin1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are allelic to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abscisic acid</ENAMEX> biosynthesis mutant 
        aba2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In addition, the
        ethylene constitutive response mutant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ctr1-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] , as well as the
        ethylene-overproduction mutant 
        eto1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] , display <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Conversely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-response mutant 
        sis1 exhibits an ethylene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutive</ENAMEX> response phenotype and is allelic to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ctr1-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . The 
        prl1 mutant, which exhibits increased
        sensitivity to exogenous sugars [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] , carries a
        mutation in a gene that encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WD protein</ENAMEX> that interacts
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNF1 protein kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
        Although a large number of studies have been conducted
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> regulation of starch breakdown by germinating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereal seeds</ENAMEX>, very little work has focused on determining
        whether lipid breakdown by germinating oilseeds is also
        sugar regulated. Findings that the expression of at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in lipid metabolism is sugar regulated [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] and that sucrose can affect total lipid content in
        germinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] suggest that lipid metabolism may
        also be sugar regulated. Work presented here indicates that
        storage lipid breakdown is significantly delayed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">germinating Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> seeds exposed to exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Seedlings growing on media containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          exhibit reduced rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid
          mobilization
          Exposure to exogenous sugars, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and
          sucrose, has long been known to retard rates of starch
          mobilization in germinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereal seeds</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 23</NUMEX> ] .
          Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether
          exogenous sugars also affect rates of lipid mobilization
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">germinating</ENAMEX> seeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, such as 
          Arabidopsis thaliana , that store
          their energy reserves in the form of lipids. Seed storage
          lipid levels were monitored by measuring eicosenoic
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> levels. Eicosenoic fatty acid
          represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 17%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> lipid reserves, but
          is present in only very low amounts in membrane lipids.
          For example, in one study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was found to
          constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2%</NUMEX> of the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> present in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> roots and was below the detection threshold
          in shoots [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the rate of decrease in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:1</TIMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> levels reflects the rate of decrease in
          seed storage lipid levels.
          Seeds of wild-type 
          Arabidopsis thaliana var. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>
          were sown on plates containing solid minimal Arabidopsis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] , supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and/or sorbitol.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Seeds/seedlings</ENAMEX> were harvested at different time points
          after the start of imbibition. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds sown</ENAMEX> on media containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> metabolize
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:1</TIMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> at a significantly slower rate than seeds
          sown on media lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. The effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> mobilization is not solely due to the increased
          osmotic potential of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equi-molar</ENAMEX> and even
          twice equi-molar concentrations of sorbitol have little
          effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> mobilization (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Growth on mannose, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-methylglucose</ENAMEX>, leads
          to reduced rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid
          mobilization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannose</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose analog</ENAMEX> that has been postulated
          to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed germination</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-regulated
          gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] via a signaling pathway that
          requires hexokinase activity. For reasons that remain
          unclear, mannose inhibits seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">germination</ENAMEX> and early
          seedling development at concentrations that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-200
          fold lower than the concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> required to
          exert similar effects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 46 47 48 50</NUMEX> ] . As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, growth on low (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4 mM</NUMEX>) concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mannose</ENAMEX> also leads to a significant reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          breakdown. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX> has little effect
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> that, in at least some organisms, is transported
          by hexose transporters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61 62 63 64</NUMEX> ] but is
          phosphorylated very inefficiently, if at all, by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexokinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . Seedlings grown on media containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> -methylglucose have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> levels
          that are similar to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> grown on
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equi-molar concentrations of sorbitol, but
          that are much lower than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> grown
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">equi</NUMEX>-molar concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          High concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or sorbitol almost
          eliminate breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipids
          Growth on high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or sucrose has been shown to severely inhibit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development of Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 46 47 48 49 50</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> ] . Most seedlings grown on high-sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> lack true
          leaves and have cotyledons that have undergone little
          expansion, even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three weeks</TIMEX> of growth. As
          more moderate sugar concentrations slow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mobilization</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), it was of interest to determine whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seedlings</ENAMEX> arrested by growth on high-sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are able
          to mobilize any of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> arrested by growth on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          retain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid,
          even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 days</TIMEX> of growth. In contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22-day</TIMEX> old
          seedlings grown in the presence of equi-molar sorbitol
          retain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4 to 5%</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid.
          The effects of high glucose concentrations on lipid
          breakdown could be due to a non-specific inhibition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developmental</ENAMEX> and/or metabolic processes. Consistent with
          this possibility are findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> arrested by
          growth on very high concentrations of sorbitol (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Glc</ENAMEX>) also retain almost all of their
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:1</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, although the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Glc</ENAMEX> on lipid mobilization are
          comparable to the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Glc</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sorbitol</ENAMEX> +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.03 M Glc</ENAMEX> inhibits lipid accumulation to a significantly
          greater extent than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M Glc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For example,
          seedlings grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 days</TIMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M Glc</ENAMEX>
          accumulate approximately twice as much membrane fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> as seedlings grown on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Glc</ENAMEX>.
          These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sorbitol + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Glc</ENAMEX> on lipid breakdown are less
          specific than the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Glc</ENAMEX>. Both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M Glc</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Glc</ENAMEX> also retard seed
          germination rates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, both these media
          supplements delay seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">germination</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 4 to 5 days</TIMEX>.
          In contrast, storage lipid mobilization is retarded for a
          significantly longer time period. For example, whereas
          seedlings growing in the absence of added <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glc</ENAMEX> or sorbitol
          mobilize <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> of
          the start of imbibition (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), seedlings grown on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.3 M Glc</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sorb</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Glc</ENAMEX> mobilize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:1</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 days</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Seedlings become resistant to the inhibitory
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid metabolism</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the start of imbibition
          Previous work indicates that wild-type Arabidopsis
          seedlings become resistant to the inhibitory effects of
          high concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) of exogenous sugars
          on seedling development within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 days</TIMEX> of the start
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">imbibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, it was of interest to
          determine whether seedlings become resistant to the

          storage lipid mobilization within the same time frame.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Seeds</ENAMEX> were either sown on low (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> media and
          then transferred after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> to high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or
          sorbitol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, or were sown directly on high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or
          sorbitol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, seedlings sown
          directly on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> exhibit little shoot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> of growth. In contrast,
          seedlings grown on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and then for

          significant shoot systems. In fact, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> have
          slightly larger average shoot systems than seedlings
          grown continuously on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, whereas seedlings sown directly on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose produce</ENAMEX> larger shoot systems
          than seedlings sown directly on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, seedlings
          transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>

          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, seedlings sown directly on media
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">containing 0.27 M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose metabolize</ENAMEX> only a small
          percentage of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> of
          growth. In addition, these seedlings exhibit a
          significant reduction in accumulation of membrane fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In contrast, seedlings shifted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX> metabolize almost all of their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:1 fatty</TIMEX> acid
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> of the shift, despite the fact that only
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid is metabolized prior to
          the shift. In addition, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> actually show
          increased accumulation of membrane fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> relative
          to seedlings grown continuously on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. As an
          osmotic control, seedlings were grown on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> sorbitol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+ 0.03 M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>, or on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>

          significant reduction in accumulation of membrane fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, whereas seedlings sown directly on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> sorbitol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+ 0.03 M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> exhibit only a slight reduction.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sis5-1/abi4-101 mutant</ENAMEX> is resistant to the
          inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid
          mobilization
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> mutants that are
          resistant to the inhibitory effects of high
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous glucose</ENAMEX> or sucrose on early
          seedling development have been isolated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49 50</NUMEX>
          ] . A representative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar-insensitive</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sis</ENAMEX> ) mutant, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sis5-1/abi4-101 mutant</ENAMEX>, was
          analyzed to determine whether mutants of this type can
          also exhibit altered responses to the effects of
          exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on lipid metabolism. As shown in Figure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sis5-1/abi4-101</ENAMEX> seedlings

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. In contrast, mutant and wild-type plants
          metabolize similar amounts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> when grown
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> sorbitol (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Although numerous studies have shown that high
        concentrations of exogenous sugars repress the ability of
        germinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereal seeds</ENAMEX> to mobilize the starch they use as
        energy reserves [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 23</NUMEX> ] , little work of a similar nature
        had previously been conducted on oilseed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. Among the few studies done previously is one
        showing that expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> is negatively regulated by sugars [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, a study of glyoxylate cycle mutants showed a
        small inhibitory effect of sucrose on total lipid content
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">germinating seeds</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Results presented here
        indicate that mobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid by 
        Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings is
        significantly retarded in the presence of exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. For example, seedlings grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        glucose retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately five</NUMEX> times as much seed
        storage lipid as seedlings grown in the absence of
        exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. This effect is not due to osmotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equi-molar</ENAMEX>, or even twice equi-molar,
        concentrations of sorbitol have little effect on lipid
        breakdown.
        Growth of seedlings on media containing higher (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>)
        concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> results in almost complete
        elimination of lipid breakdown. For example, seedlings
        grown in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> retain approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid, even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 days</TIMEX> of
        growth. The effects of high glucose concentrations on lipid
        breakdown could be relatively specific or could be due to a
        non-specific inhibition of developmental and/or metabolic
        processes. Interestingly, sorbitol can also inhibit seed
        storage lipid breakdown. However, the effect of sorbitol on
        seed storage lipid breakdown is only manifested at sorbitol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sorbitol + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>) that
        also almost completely eliminate seedling growth. In
        addition, the effects of sorbitol on seedling growth appear
        less specific than the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbitol</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose exerts</ENAMEX> a similar effect on
        storage lipid breakdown as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, but has a
        significantly greater effect on accumulation of membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX>. In addition, although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser
        extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbitol retard seed</ENAMEX> germination rates, both
        additives retard mobilization of storage lipids to a
        significantly greater extent than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> germination.
        The effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose analogs</ENAMEX> on lipid breakdown were
        also determined. Seedlings grown on media containing
        mannose, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX>, exhibit decreased
        rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid breakdown. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mannose</ENAMEX> has been shown to be a substrate for hexokinases
        whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX> is metabolized
        poorly, if at all, by hexokinases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 65</NUMEX> ] . As a result,
        processes that are affected by mannose but not by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> -methylglucose have been postulated
        to be regulated via a hexokinase-mediated pathway(s) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . By this logic, the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid
        breakdown is repressed by the presence of mannose but not
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX> could also be
        interpreted to mean that inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid
        breakdown occurs via a hexokinase-mediated pathway.
        However, alternative explanations cannot be ruled out at
        this time. First, the extent to which mannose and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> -methylglucose are metabolized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexokinases</ENAMEX> and other enzymes has yet to be determined for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. In addition, a recent report indicates that
        mannose may affect some processes by sequestering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>, rather than by stimulating a hexokinase-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-response pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Although the mechanism by
        which mannose acts is uncertain at this time, the fact that
        it retards lipid breakdown when present at concentrations
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.4</NUMEX> mM indicates that the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mannose</ENAMEX> cannot
        be attributed to osmotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> sugar-response mutants have been
        isolated that, unlike wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, are able to develop
        substantial shoot systems in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sucrose</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Analysis of a
        representative mutant of this type, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sis5-1/abi4-101 mutant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] ,
        reveals that it is resistant to the inhibitory effects of
        exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid breakdown. This
        result indicates that mutations that alleviate the negative
        effects of exogenous sugars on early seedling development
        can also reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage
        lipid breakdown.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX>-shift experiments indicate that wild-type
        seedlings become insensitive to the inhibitory effects of
        exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid metabolism within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days of the start of imbibition</TIMEX>. Interestingly, wild-type
        Arabidopsis seedlings were shown previously to become
        insensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibition of early seedling
        development within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 days of the start of imbibition</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] . In addition, seedlings of 
        Brassica napus , a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of
        Arabidopsis, undergo a dramatic metabolic shift during the
        same time period [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after the
        start of imbibition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. napus</ENAMEX> seedlings shift from being
        dependent on lipid breakdown to being dependent on
        photosynthesis for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> formation. The similar timing with
        which these events occur suggests that completion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolic</ENAMEX> transition from lipid breakdown to photosynthesis
        as the primary source of sugars results in loss of
        sensitivity to the negative effects of sugars on lipid
        breakdown and early seedling development. However,
        exogenous sugars can completely compensate for mutations
        that disrupt the glyoxylate cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . This finding
        suggests that the negative effects of high concentrations
        of exogenous sugars on early seedling development and seed
        storage lipid breakdown are not the result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibition of the glyoxylate cycle. Further
        experiments will be required to clarify the relationship
        between inhibition of early seedling development and seed
        storage lipid breakdown by exogenous sugars.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Although many studies have examined the effects of sugar
        levels on rate of starch breakdown by germinating cereal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, little effort has been devoted to characterizing the
        effects of sugar levels on lipid breakdown by germinating
        oilseed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Work presented here demonstrates that
        growth in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous glucose</ENAMEX> significantly
        retards mobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid in germinating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-insensitive mutant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sis5-1/abi4-101</ENAMEX> is resistant to the
        inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous glucose</ENAMEX> on lipid breakdown.
        The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage lipid breakdown is
        not solely due to the osmotic potential of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, as
        substantially higher concentrations of sorbitol than of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> are required to exert significant effects on lipid
        breakdown. Mannose, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O -methylglucose</ENAMEX>, also inhibits lipid
        breakdown. This result suggests that phosphorylation by
        hexokinase may be required for inhibition of lipid
        breakdown. However, as metabolism of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> analogs
        remains to be characterized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>, alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explanations</ENAMEX> cannot be ruled out at this time. The
        inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on lipid breakdown are
        limited to a narrow developmental window. Within
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days of the start of imbibition</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">germinating Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> seeds become insensitive to the
        inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous glucose</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage
        lipid mobilization. This result suggests that completion of
        some critical metabolic transition results in loss of
        sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> on lipid
        breakdown.

          has been described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Seeds/seedlings</ENAMEX> to
          be used in fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid assays</ENAMEX> were grown on sterilized 3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW Gel Blot Paper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) placed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petri</ENAMEX> plates containing solid Arabidopsis
          minimal media [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] , supplemented with the indicated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX>. The gel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blot paper</ENAMEX> prevented growth of the
          roots into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, allowing for easy and quantitative
          removal of seedling tissue for analysis. Unless otherwise
          noted, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were grown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 60 to 80 Î</TIMEX>¼mol photons m-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s-1</ENAMEX> continuous fluorescent light, at a temperature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          to 25Â°C.
        
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> extraction and derivatization
          Lipids were extracted and fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids derivatized</ENAMEX> to
          form the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl esters</ENAMEX> using an established
          procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . Typically, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 to 50</TIMEX> seeds/seedlings
          were collected from a sector of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Petri</ENAMEX> plate for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>/seedlings were incubated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ml 1 N</ENAMEX> methanolic-HCl (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supelco, Bellefonte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80 to 83Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h. Equal</ENAMEX> volumes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) NaCl
          and hexane were added to each sample. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          shaken by hand for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 2</TIMEX> min and then spun at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at room temperature.
          The top (hexane) layers of each sample were transferred
          to vials and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX> prior to being analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas chromatography</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gas</ENAMEX> chromatography
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl ester</ENAMEX> levels were measured by gas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> using a previously described program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>
          ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> Î¼l aliquots of each fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl</ENAMEX> ester
          extract were injected onto a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5890</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series II</ENAMEX> gas
          chromatograph from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> containing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> m
          SP2330 column with an inner diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.75 mm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supelco</ENAMEX>,
          Bellefonte, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The column was exposed to the
          following temperature program: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, ramp to
          160Â°C at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25Â°C</NUMEX> per min, ramp to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220Â°C</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10Â°C</NUMEX> per min,
          220Â°C for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> min. The pressure program for the column
          was: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> kPa for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 min</TIMEX>, ramp to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kPa at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 kPa per min</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kPa for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> min. The temperatures of the injector and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> ionization detector were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">220Â°C and 250Â°C</TIMEX>,
          respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helium</ENAMEX> was used as the carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid identification</ENAMEX> and quantitation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gas chromatograph</ENAMEX> peaks were identified by comparing
          their column retention times with the retention times of
          fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl</ENAMEX> ester standards (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The quantities of all major fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in each
          sample were determined by comparing the sizes of the gas
          chromatography peaks produced by each sample with the
          sizes of the peaks produced by fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl</ENAMEX> ester
          standards of known concentration. This data was used to
          calculate the net amounts of membrane fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          produced by the seedlings in each sample. In oilseeds
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>, the bulk of the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> present
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> and very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> are found in storage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX>. For example, storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of the
          total lipid found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ungerminated</ENAMEX> seeds of 
          Brassica napus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] , a plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that is closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. The
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> lipids consist of non-storage
          lipids, such as membrane lipids. To calculate the
          increase in the amount of membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> in a
          particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of seedlings, it is necessary to
          subtract the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed fatty acid</ENAMEX> (both storage and
          non-storage) remaining in those seedlings from the total
          amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> present in the seedlings.
          The amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> remaining in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">seedlings</ENAMEX> harvested at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "x" can be calculated using
          the following equation:
          (Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>-storage fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x"</ENAMEX>) = (Î¼g fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>)(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.93</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">(Î¼g 20</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x"</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/(Î¼g 20:1</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>)]
          As <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 93%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> lipids consist of storage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] , the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> found in
          ungerminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> is multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX> to determine the
          amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> present in the storage lipid of
          ungerminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>. This number is then multiplied by the
          fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (eicosenoic) fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> remaining at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>
          "x", to account for the percentage of storage lipid that
          has been metabolized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "x". Assuming that different
          seed-storage fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are metabolized at similar
          rates, eicosenoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> levels will reflect seed
          storage lipid levels as eicosenoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> is present
          in significant amounts in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX> but is
          almost entirely lacking from non-storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX>, such as
          membrane lipids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] .
          The amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> non-storage fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> present in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seedlings</ENAMEX> can be calculated using the following
          equation:
          (Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> non-storage fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">= (Î¼g fatty acid</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>)(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.07</NUMEX>)
          As <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> lipids consist of
          non-storage lipids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] , the total amount of fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> found in ungerminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> is multiplied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX> to
          determine the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> present in the
          non-storage lipid of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ungerminated seeds</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the increase in the amount of fatty acid
          present in the membranes of seedlings harvested at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>
          "x" after the start of imbibition can be calculated using
          the following equation:
          (Increase in membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x"</ENAMEX>) = (total
          Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x"</ENAMEX>) - (Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>-storage fatty acid
          remaining at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x"</ENAMEX>) - (Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> non-storage fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>)
        
        
          Seed germination
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Seeds</ENAMEX> were surface sterilized and sown on the
          indicated media. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Seeds</ENAMEX> were scored for germination at
          regular intervals. Seed germination is defined as the
          emergence of any part of the seedling from the seed
          coat.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX>-shift experiments
          For media-shift experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW Gel Blot Paper</ENAMEX> was
          placed on top of solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petri</ENAMEX> plates. Nytex mesh
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3-300/46</NUMEX> screens (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tetko Incorp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          were then placed on top of the blot paper and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> sown
          on top of the nytex screens. At the indicated times, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nytex</ENAMEX> screens and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>/seedlings were transferred to
