        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> are increasingly realizing the importance of
        
        true biological replicates for
        assessing statistical confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , but replication is often hindered by
        financial or technical constraints. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem is that
        large, prefabricated microarray chips can be relatively
        expensive, driving up the total cost of an experiment. (In
        fact, the cost of a subject is often lower.) Another
        obstacle to using replicates is that the biological tissues
        from which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is extracted can often be of such small
        quantity by nature that it is technically difficult to get
        enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX> from one subject for hybridization to one
        array [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Either or both of these problems have
        motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> to pool <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> together before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. Many research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> using this method have
        been published [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , but the statistical properties
        of pooling have not been explicitly addressed. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different approaches of sample pooling. One is dubbed
        "complete pooling", where all samples from one treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> are pooled onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chip and there is no replication
        of chips for one treatment. This approach does not provide
        an estimate of variability among chips and therefore can
        not be used for statistical analysis. The other approach is
        dubbed "sub-pooling", where subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are randomly
        selected and pooled onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chip but there are still
        multiple chips within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Here we investigated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> properties and the technical and financial
        implications of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, sub-pooling approach.
      
      
        Results
        
          Simulation study of statistical
          characteristics
          First, simulated microarray data were used to
          investigate the statistical properties (see Methods for
          details). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the simulated power curves (for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t tests) with respect to different Î± levels
          (i.e. type I error rates), effect sizes (i.e. differences
          of the means divided by common standard deviation), and
          sample sizes. Some well-known statistical properties are
          shown here: power increases with effect size and/or
          sample size when other conditions are fixed (e.g. curve 8
          vs. curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, or curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> vs. curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); but it decreases
          when Î± level is lowered with other conditions being fixed
          (e.g. curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> vs. curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, the main purpose of
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1is</NUMEX> to demonstrate the effect of pooling. Consider
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">curves 5 to 8</TIMEX>, all of which have Î± level fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
          Without pooling, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine replicates</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) give
          much higher power than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three replicates</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (curve
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). With pooling, power curves are intermediate. Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">curve 6</ENAMEX> and curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> reveal the power of pooling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          samples onto <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> chips each. The difference between
          them is that equal pooling with replicates in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> contributing equally (curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) has better power than
          non-equal pooling (curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). See methods section for
          statistical justification. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that power curve 7 is
          not very far from power curve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one third</NUMEX> the
          number of chips being used.
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2shows</TIMEX> that approximately equivalent power to
          non-pooling can be achieved if the number of gene chips
          is reduced but the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is increased. The
          simulated power curves for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t tests for
          different pooling schemes under the same type I error
          rate control are very similar. In this figure, n25c5
          means that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are randomly
          pooled onto <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5</NUMEX> chips with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> contributing equally
          to each pool. Specifically, the power of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n25c5</NUMEX>) â‰ˆ power
          of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n24c6</NUMEX>) â‰ˆ power of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n22c11</NUMEX>) â‰ˆ power of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n21c7</NUMEX>) â‰ˆ power
          of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n20c20</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that power of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n25c5</NUMEX>) â‰ˆ power of
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">n20c20</NUMEX>), which suggests that by randomly pooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chip with equal
          contributions, we can decrease number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chips</ENAMEX> needed per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 5</TIMEX> while number of subjects per group
          only needs to be increased from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 25</TIMEX>. As will be
          shown later, this may have great financial
          consequences.
        
        
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Virtual</ENAMEX>" pooling example using data from an
          Affymetrix microarray experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blalock et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] investigated the correlation of
          gene expression with cognitive impairment in rats of
          different ages. Original data were from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. To further study the effect of pooling, we
          used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> arrays to do "virtual pooling". <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Namely,</ENAMEX>
          we first randomly selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> arrays and assigned them to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-values from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t-tests on
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were recorded. Next, in each of the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, we "virtually" pooled the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> samples onto <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 4, 3</ENAMEX>
          arrays respectively (assuming equal contribution in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>). The statistical tests were then conducted on the
          "pooled" data with degrees of freedom being reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2*</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-1</ENAMEX>)), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2*</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-1</ENAMEX>)), or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2*</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-1</ENAMEX>)),
          respectively. The P-values from the "pooled" data were
          then plotted against the original P-values. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, there is a good agreement of the P-values among
          the pooling schemes for the majority of the genes among
          the pooling and no pooling schemes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that a
          moderate percentage of those genes that are found to be
          significant at a fixed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) level can be picked up by
          designs with pooling at the same Î± level.
          Multiple-testing adjustment was not considered here
          because it is a separate statistical issue. Note that
          "virtual" pooling serves as indirect evidence only.
        
        
          Effect size considerations
          Because we are testing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes
          at the same time, it is not easy to determine the effect
          size needed for power or sample size estimation. Effect
          size can vary from experiment to experiment, from one
          kind of biological sample to another, as well as from
          gene to gene. If we set the goal of an experiment to
          detect all genes that are differentially expressed at any
          scale, then the sample size needed to do so would be
          prohibitively large. Therefore, we need to set up a
          realistic goal, say, to detect genes with effect size â‰¥
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. For a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t test, this means the true
          difference between the means is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of the common
          standard deviation. Empirical data from many experiments
          suggest that this goal is often achievable. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> study
          is also desirable to obtain an estimate of approximate
          effect size for specific experiments and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. To assist
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in making such estimates, we include here
          some empirical results from several experiments conducted
          in our core <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, which may provide a rough idea
          regarding the range of effect sizes that might be
          realistically expected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of microarray - the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix oligonucleotide GeneChip Â®array.</ENAMEX> Of course,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> should be cautious in relying on these
          numbers, as they are estimates based on pilot studies
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> microarray core <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Financial implications of sample pooling and
          optimal pooling design
          Since a microarray chip often costs more than a
          biological subject and we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> pooling
          design to achieve the same statistical control, it is
          possible for us to search for the most cost effective
          pooling design while maintaining the desired statistical
          properties. For a given combination of maximal type I
          error rate, minimal power, and the estimated or expected
          effect size to be detected, there are multiple pooling
          designs that may satisfy these conditions. We can compare
          the total cost of chips and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> for each design and
          choose the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with minimal total cost, provided it is
          technical feasible. While this is a simplified economic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">framework</ENAMEX> (because it does not consider other cost in the
          experiment), it manifests the major point of the
          financial efficiency with pooling. An example function
          written in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> language used to automate the searching and
          comparing process is attached as an additional file.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Assessing variability on a per gene basis is an
        increasingly important aspect of microarray analysis. In
        the present paper we demonstrate that variance could be
        estimated accurately with different pooling schemes, and
        that the chip cost (and therefore experimental cost) can be
        dramatically affected by decisions regarding the pooling
        scheme employed. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are aware that replicates
        of biological samples are needed to assess experimental
        error. Even though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes are interrogated
        simultaneously on each chip, estimates of variance based on
        these measures do not of course include biological variance
        for any single gene in question. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we
        addressed the question of how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX> are needed to
        achieve adequate power while considering an efficient
        technical procedure that is applicable in microarray
        experiments.
        Since the specific design and data processing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> can cause some confusion about what constitutes
        true replicates, it is important to distinguish technical
        replicates from biological replicates. In the Affymetrix
        microarray, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 to 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs are used to measure
        expression level of a probe set. It is important to note
        that these duplicated probe pairs are different measurement
        units rather than experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The true biological
        replicates are the arrays (provided that they do not
        measure the same biological sample). An estimate of
        variability among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs reveals the precision of
        the measurement at the probe level but not the variability
        among biological samples. The latter is usually what is
        needed when conducting statistical hypothesis testing in
        order to make inferences about differential gene expression
        under various treatment or environmental conditions.
        Confusion between technical duplicates and biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> can sometimes lead to misconceptions in
        conducting and interpreting statistical tests. Based on the
        intensity readings on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs, Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite Version 5.0</ENAMEX> gives a "change P-value" for
        the comparison analysis of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set ("gene") between
        a baseline chip and an experiment chip (MAS V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> manual)
        based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> signed rank test. According to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manual</ENAMEX>, the change P-value indicates the significance of
        the difference between the experimental chip and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baseline</ENAMEX> chip. However, it should be noted that a
        significant difference of gene expression between a 
        single chip from the experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and a 
        single chip from the baseline group
        can not provide statistical evidence to show that the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are different. Often the goal of comparing a
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is to detect the true
        difference of the population means, and the "change
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-value" is not the appropriate P-value for that goal.
        To overcome the difficulty of estimating the variance of
        microarray data with few or no biological replicates,
        so-called "cross-gene models", "global error models" or
        "local error models" have been proposed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . According
        to such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, genes with similar expression levels from
        the same chip can be "borrowed" to construct a pseudo
        sample as the basis to estimate the "global" or "local"
        errors for each individual gene. This is very appealing
        because "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> comparisons can now be done on
        experiments without replicates by using the global error
        model" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, these algorithms are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        implicit assumptions that are difficult to support:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). The measurement of the expression of a gene on one
        single chip can be used to estimate the 
        true population mean expression of
        that gene. This assumption is often false because an
        observed intensity can be far from the 
        true mean with moderate or high
        probability. For example, even if gene expression
        measurements follow a perfect normal distribution, the
        chance that a measurement falls beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard
        deviation from the mean on either side is as large as
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). Genes with similar measurement values "share" the
        same variance within the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This assumption
        may be reasonably accurate for some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (e.g. those with
        low expression intensities), but empirical observations
        show that it is clearly not true for all genes, especially
        for those with high intensity.
        The cross gene error model references for support the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> component error model proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocke et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durbin et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] but those papers made it very clear
        that true replication could not be circumvented, especially
        to estimate variances for genes with high expression. (For
        additional discussion on different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .)
        Except under very restrictive models, duplicate
        observations per chip do not provide valid estimates of
        variability among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Hence, multiple chips per
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, each measuring an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX> from a
        separate biological subject or pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of subjects,
        are required for statistical analysis. However, this
        approach often entails financial and/or technical
        difficulties. To address these issues, we tested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooling</ENAMEX> and showed that it provides an efficient
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>. Because arrays are usually more
        expensive than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, sample pooling frequently may help
        defray the total cost of an experiment. The larger the
        difference between the cost of a single array and that of a
        single subject, the more the sub-pooling strategy will
        save. Simulated microarray data and "virtual pooling" of
        actual data utilized here as well as statistical theory
        suggest that the underlying principles of this proposal are
        sound. Note that even with pooling, we still show a
        requirement for reasonable replication of (pooled) arrays
        because there is no other way to assess biological
        variation.
        A limitation of our current study is that we have yet to
        conduct a definitive experiment in which the same
        biological samples are compared with or without pooling.
        Although this has not been done, we nevertheless have
        indirect supporting evidences from multiple actual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. After analyzing data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 50</NUMEX>
        research projects ( 
        with replications ) done in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX>, we have consistently seen smaller within-group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> (and more genes with significant differences)
        in experiments using appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pooling strategies
        than those with approximately the same number of arrays
        that did not employ pooling. This observation implies that
        experiments with pooling have greater power than those
        without pooling for a fixed number of chips, when
        conditions are comparable (i.e. similar experimental
        conditions, statistical methods and multiple testing
        correction procedures, etc.). In addition, a recent study [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] found high correlation between the intensities from the
        calculated pool and those from the actual pool using the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, (although in that study the pooling effect on
        reducing variance was not explicitly addressed).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA pooling</ENAMEX> may also have adverse consequences, and can
        be inappropriate in some cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooling</ENAMEX> should not be used
        if inferences are needed for single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. For example,
        when the goal of the research is to correlate gene
        expression with some other variables measured at the
        subject level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] or to identify gene profiles that help
        classify individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and predict their membership
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> vs. normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooling</ENAMEX> will also prevent later analysis of the data on
        variables that may have been ignored initially. As an
        example, suppose that we pooled all samples from the same
        gender and compared the differential expression of some
        genes between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genders. This would make it
        impossible to subsequently analyze differential gene
        expression related to aging effects since samples from
        different ages would have been pooled together. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> must decide at the outset whether the potential
        loss of information is outweighed by the increased
        statistical power and cost-efficiency of the design.
        Similarly, pooling will prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> from finding
        differences in expression that might divide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> set of
        samples. For example, if the goal of the experiment is to
        find genes that help differentiate subtypes of colon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> rather than between colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and healthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, then it is inappropriate to pool cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>.
        As pointed out by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reviewer, sample pooling is able
        to reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-specific variance, but assumes that
        residual individual variance is not influenced by the group
        variable. While this assumption may be a reasonable first
        approximation, it does not allow for the possibility of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-product relationship in which a group-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> (for example, toxic exposure) might lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informative</ENAMEX> sub-states that exhibit separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        coordinately regulated responsive genes as a function of
        the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> responds. Thus, there
        may also be loss of information regarding possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-product relationships by pooling. The experimenter
        should be aware of this caveat before deciding to pool
        samples.
        There are also a few technical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with pooling.
        Theoretically, the more samples pooled, the greater the
        improvement in power. Practically, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> may
        be reluctant to pool <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chip due
        to technical limitations, and here we restricted our
        comparisons among pool sizes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than five</NUMEX>. Further,
        we recommend pooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> instead of tissue or cell
        samples, because the variability at the tissue level is
        usually larger than at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level. However, as long as
        equal contribution is assured, pooling at the tissue level
        should not make a big difference.
        Finally, although we used only Affymetrix
        oligonucleotide data models as examples in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, the
        same principles should be readily applicable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> color
        cDNA arrays as well. In general, pooling should have
        similar advantages for more complex experimental designs
        (such as factorial designs, time course designs, etc.),
        when inferences are being made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> level.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Appropriately designed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample pooling can provide
        adequate statistical power, and improve efficiency and
        cost-effectiveness, for many types of microarray
        experiments when inferences are made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> level.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have to consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons of
        pooling for their experimental objectives. Designing
        optimal pooling schemes to achieve statistical control with
        minimal total cost is readily possible before the
        experiments are conducted.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mixtures of Individual Gene Expressions</ENAMEX>
          Gene expression levels for a single gene for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> will be denoted as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,...,<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are randomly selected
          and pooled, then we can model the resulting gene
          expression level as , where w 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,..., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
          
            p 
           are the mixing coefficients. These coefficients may
          be random. If the original gene expression levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,...,<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , are identically and independently
          distributed random variables with mean Î¼ and variance Ïƒ
          2and the mixing coefficients are independent of the
          individual gene expression levels, then we have
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ïƒ 2/</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p â‰</ENAMEX>¤ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Var</ENAMEX> ( 
          X *) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¤ Ïƒ 2</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          This result follows immediately from the fact that
          
          and
          
          Since , (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) follows. Note that the lower bound is
          achieved when the mixing coefficients are equal; i.e.,
          uniform mixing. This shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pooling reduces
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> and the minimal variance of the mixture is
          achieved with equal pooling.
        
        
          Relative Efficiency
          As far as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chips</ENAMEX> needed is concerned, the
          relative efficiency of pooling 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> subject to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> chips with uniform mixing can be
          computed as:
          
          as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n â†’ âˆž</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n â†’</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX>. Hence, when 
          p samples are equally mixed, we
          need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1/</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> of the original number of chips
          to achieve similar power with pooling when both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is large and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is small. This is a large sample
          result and does not take into account the loss of degrees
          of freedom for the test. Next, we consider the effects of
          both aspects on statistical power.
        
        
          Power Equivalence
          Although pooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> with uniform mixing
          substantially reduces the variability among chips within
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, this may not result in an increase in power
          while testing differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with a fixed
          number of subjects. Here we investigate the power of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t-test. Let X 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,...,<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> be identically and independently
          distributed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N(Î</ENAMEX>¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , Ïƒ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ,...,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> be identically and independently
          distributed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N(Î</ENAMEX>¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , Ïƒ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 2</NUMEX>). For simplicity, let Ïƒ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>= Ïƒ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ïƒ 2</NUMEX>. Suppose we use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test to test H 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 : Î</TIMEX>¼ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = Î¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> against H 
          a : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <Î¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Without pooling, the t statistic
          follows the central t distribution 
          f ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>, df 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) with 
          df 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n - 1</ENAMEX>) under H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ; while under H 
          a , it follows a non-central t
          distribution with 
          df 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and non-centrality parameter , which
          is inversely related to the standard deviation Ïƒ. For a
          fixed Î± level, we can find a critical value t 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> under H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> such that . To compute the power, we
          only need to find the rejection region corresponding to t
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> under the alternative non-central t
          distribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>, df 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 , Î´</ENAMEX>): . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</TIMEX> when the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are randomly assigned
          into pools of size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> with equal mixing, power is
          decreased because the degrees of freedom are reduced to 
          df 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p - 1</ENAMEX>), which makes the tails of
          the central t distribution under H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> heavier and thus the critical value
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 *</TIMEX> will be further from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, while the
          non-centrality parameter is unchanged: (since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> is reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ïƒ 2/</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> and the number of chips reduced
          to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ). However, if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with pool size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> are compared to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without pooling, then
          the power change is not monotonic. The loss of power due
          to reduction of degrees of freedom will be partially
          compensated by gain of power due to increase of effect
          size. This can be seen by noting that the non-centrality
          parameter for pooling is now , which is non-trivially
          larger than . This shifts the alternative distribution
          further away from the null distribution and thus
          increases power. Hence we have heuristically shown that
          the power change is not monotonic when decreasing
          replication of chips while simultaneously increasing
          number of subjects. This implies that power can be
          preserved with the right choice of (subject) sample size
          and pool size. Many statistical software packages, such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, have built-in functions for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> and non-central t distributions and thus we can
          write programs to evaluate the power change or equivalent
          power curves under different pooling schemes. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          sided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t test or experiments with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX>
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, we can use the central and non-central
          F distributions rather than t distributions. The power
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equivalence</ENAMEX> should be very similar. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> not very
          familiar with the above statistical concepts are referred
          to [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Simulation study
          To investigate the above properties, we generated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-treatment design and then
          compared the performance of different pooling schemes. We
          simulated microarray data as follows: randomly generate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data matrix</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> rows and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> columns, with each row represents
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and each column represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> subject. The
          first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are random samples from
          a normal distribution with mean Î¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and standard deviation Ïƒ; the last 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are random samples from
          a normal distribution with mean Î¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and standard deviation Ïƒ, where .
          For each row, Î¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was generated from a uniform
          distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 30000</ENAMEX>) and standard deviation Ïƒ is set
          to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.2 * Î</TIMEX>¼ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . The effect size Î´ was specified
          for every data matrix.
          Simulation of power curves without pooling: for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î´</NUMEX> from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 30</TIMEX>, we generated data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrices</ENAMEX> and then performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t tests on each
          row between the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> observations and the last 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> observations. For each specified
          Î´, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and Î± level (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>), we
          repeated the above simulation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> times and recorded the
          proportion of rejections, 
          R 
          Î±, Î´, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>  , for each iteration. We
          then calculated the averaged 
          R 
          Î±, Î´, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>  as the simulated power.
          Simulation of power curves with pooling: similar to
          the above with the only difference being that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample t tests were performed on first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> pools and last 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> pools, where each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> pools is the average of 
          p subjects randomly selected from
          the original 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Note that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> * 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> and we used sampling without
          replacement. This is to simulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> of equal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooling</ENAMEX>.
