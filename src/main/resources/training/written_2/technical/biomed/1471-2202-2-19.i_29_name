        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observable changes at a developing
        neuromuscular synapse is the aggregation of nicotinic
        acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (AChRs) in the postsynaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. This aggregation can be detected within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of stimulation by a nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> or by alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimuli</ENAMEX>, and is crucial to the function of the mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synapse</ENAMEX> in that it ensures both speed and reliability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction. Extensive studies in varied
        experimental systems have identified specific
        intra-cellular [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] and extra-cellular [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] components which appear to be involved in the
        formation and maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates.
        In addition to a contacting nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>, receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> can be induced by several experimental stimuli
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agrin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , electric fields [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , polystyrene beads [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , culture substratum
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] , and high calcium or neuraminidase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26</NUMEX>
        ] . Among these agrin is the only one for which a strong
        argument of physiological relevance can be advanced.
        Published accounts have demonstrated that the neuromuscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">junction</ENAMEX> does not develop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agrin deficient mutant mice</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] , in strong support of "the agrin hypothesis" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        .
        More recently a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the laminin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">laminin-1,</ENAMEX>
        has been shown to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregation. Interestingly,
        this induction appears to be independent of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanism</ENAMEX>(s) by which agrin acts based on an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> dose
        response relationship, the lack of requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuSK</ENAMEX>,
        and the lack of tyrosine-phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aggregation</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . Note that in this context
        "independent" simply means that there is at least some
        difference in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences of events besides the
        signaling event, and (from the dose response data) that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> do not share a rate limiting step. The
        existence of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> is important because many
        studies over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decades</TIMEX> have implicitly assumed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX>, whether spontaneous or induced by
        various stimuli, constitutes a single phenomenon carried
        out by a common mechanism.
        To further address the extent to which commonality of
        mechanism exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentially induced</ENAMEX> receptor
        aggregates we have compared the ultra-structural
        arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within spontaneous and agrin or
        laminin-1 induced aggregates. We previously demonstrated
        that agrin induced receptor aggregates are aligned on a
        hexagonal grid of ca. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.9 ¬± 0.5 nm spacing</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        We show now that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin-1 induced</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates do
        not exhibit this regularity in ultrastructure, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spontaneous</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates display heterogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, with some aggregates showing regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX> while others do not.
      
      
        Results
        Laminin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> clearly induces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregation over and
        above that found spontaneously in control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Using software designed to quantify aggregate number, size,
        and position similar to that reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ,
        we have determined that there are significant increases in
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> and size of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> aggregates following
        treatment with laminin-1 (e.g. aggregates per cell = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX> ¬±
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.23</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.9 ¬± .26</NUMEX> for control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student T</ENAMEX> p < .0001 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        ] ). This finding parallels reports in mouse muscle cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] , but is in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> report from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        At the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">scanning electron microscopy</ENAMEX>, membrane
        regions rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> (whether spontaneous or induced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agrin</ENAMEX> or laminin) show receptor distributions which appear
        decidedly non-random (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). That is, numerous
        "nanoaggregates" - very dense nanometer scale particle
        clusters - are seen which give an appearance markedly
        different from what is seen, for example, in plots of
        points selected at random. This heterogeneous,
        nanoaggregate rich visual impression is confirmed by
        quantitative analysis of the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distances
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In both laminin induced and control AChR
        aggregates there are far more small (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> nm) distances
        found than would be expected in truly random distributions
        (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>, dashed curve; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods
        for theoretical distribution). This means that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are closer to each other than predicted by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> distribution, exactly as would be expected by the
        formation of nanoaggregates. The same theoretical random
        particle distribution function can be better fit to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> by artificially increasing the density many fold
        (solid curves). These are still statistically inconsistent
        with the data of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3B</ENAMEX>, in part because the
        predictive equation assumes a sharp cutoff at the hindrance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) while the data clearly
        show a more gradually decreasing probability as a (somewhat
        smaller) hindrance distance is approached.
        With respect to structure within aggregates, the arrows
        in these figures indicate the positions at which agrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates were found to peak, which
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were arranged in a hexagonal array
        with a spacing of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 9.9 nm</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . It can
        be seen that these peaks are not present in laminin-1
        induced aggregates (A), but may be weakly present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spontaneous</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). To examine whether
        these small peaks in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-40</NUMEX> nm range are significant,
        the distributions were fit to quadratics and tested
        statistically against them. This is not to suggest a
        quadratic form for the distribution, but rather to test
        whether that region of a distribution is consistent with a
        smoothly decreasing function. It was determined that
        laminin-1 induced aggregate structure is in fact consistent
        with this, but that spontaneous aggregate structure is not
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, legend). Thus it appears that at least some of
        the peaks seen in spontaneous aggregate nearest neighbor
        distances are significant.
        To probe further into aggregate structure software was
        designed to detect nanoaggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
        Figure 4shows a plot of a scanning electron micrograph
        montage, revealing the overall ultrastructural arrangement
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX>. The colors illustrate the aggregate detection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> and confirm that its function is consistent with
        what the human eye detects as nanoaggregates Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative nanoaggregates</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, which
        also illustrates the measurements applied to them. These
        are size (number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles), density, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        measures of spherical vs. oblong shape: the normalized
        area/perimeter ratio, and the diameter ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the mean and standard error of these
        measures applied to laminin induced, spontaneous, and agrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates. No significant differences are
        seen in any of these measures between laminin induced and
        spontaneous aggregates. However compared to either of
        these, agrin induced aggregates are significantly larger
        and 
        less dense in terms of gold particle
        distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student T</ENAMEX> p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). Although it is at
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance counter-intuitive, this decrease in particle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> (agrin induced aggregates) is best interpreted as
        an 
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor density</ENAMEX> (see
        Discussion). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the correlation between these
        measures when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> experimental treatments are pooled
        (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX>).
        There appears to be a modest negative correlation
        between size and density. This means that larger aggregates
        tend to have a lower density of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles, in
        agreement with the finding that agrin induced
        nanoaggregates are both larger and less dense than those of
        laminin induced or spontaneous nanoaggregates Although
        there may be a small negative correlation between density
        and the area/perimeter ratio this would at best account for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15%</NUMEX> of the variation seen in these measurements, and
        seems to be contra-indicated by the much smaller
        correlation between density and the diameter ratio. This
        latter ratio and the area/perimeter ratio are highly
        correlated, confirming that they measure approximately the
        same shape attribute along the linear-to-circular dimension
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
        The apparently weak regular structure seen in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spontaneous</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates suggests <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities.
        First, it could be that these nanoaggregates are
        homogeneous with respect to structure, and they all display
        an underlying hexagonal structure which is partially masked
        by "misplaced" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within these aggregates. At the
        other extreme, it could be that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        of spontaneous nanoaggregates, one of which shows
        significant hexagonal structure while the other does not.
        Despite the similarities in the means and variances of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> measures for laminin induced and spontaneous
        nanoaggregates, an examination of the underlying frequency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">histograms</ENAMEX> revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> suggestive difference in this
        regard. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the frequency histograms for density
        in laminin-1 induced (A) and spontaneous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) nanoaggregates
        The former appears to be a simple, skewed distribution, but
        the latter appears to be bimodal, thereby suggesting that
        there may indeed be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Because of this, and the difference in particle density
        seen in agrin induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanoaggregates</ENAMEX>, we examined the
        nearest neighbor distances distribution for the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> above and one below the density median
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7Ait</TIMEX> is seen that the high density
        fraction of spontaneous nanoaggregates shows very little in
        the way of regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. On the other hand Figure
        7Bshows an improved match of the low density fraction to
        the predicted peaks (arrows) which represent a hexagonal
        array of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> nm spacing. In fact this low density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is not significantly different from the modeled
        distribution based on the geometry and spacing assumptions
        previously presented (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, legend) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        Moreover this difference in density and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orderliness</ENAMEX> cannot
        be attributed to subtle experimental variations from
        preparation to preparation: of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> control images containing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> nanoaggregate, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> contained nanoaggregates
        both above and below the median density (see Discussion).
        Thus the latter hypothesis presented above appears to be
        the valid one: spontaneous receptor aggregates are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX>, with some showing well ordered structure and
        others none at all.
      
      
        Discussion
        This work was undertaken with the expectation that the
        ultrastructure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates - whether spontaneous or
        induced by laminin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - would either be ordered like those
        of agrin induced aggregates, or unordered. As often
        transpires the experimental results lead in a direction
        that is both more complicated and more interesting. In
        interpreting our results it is useful to keep clearly in
        mind the different spatial scales of observation.
        Accordingly we have used the term "nanoaggregates" to
        denote phenomena at the nanometer scale of resolution, as
        distinguished from the commonly used "microaggregates"
        which indicates aggregation observations at the micron
        scale.
        Laminin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> clearly induces microaggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in our culture system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This
        finding conflicts with a recent report based on a similar
        approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , although the differences in the system
        may be significant. In the cited work embryonic 
        Xenopus myocytes were cultured onto a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat tail collagen substrates</ENAMEX>, which promotes cell adhesion
        and a flattening out of the cells, and incubated at a
        laminin concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 6</NUMEX> nM. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> report
        that control (unstimulated) cultures under these conditions
        typically display <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> "megaclusters" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 40</NUMEX> Œºm) on
        the ventral surface. In our system the myocytes are plated
        onto clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass coverslips</ENAMEX>, typically do not flatten out
        on the substrate, and display only small microaggregates,
        if any, in controls (e.g. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Thus the induction of
        receptor aggregates by laminin-1 may be either
        statistically or physiologically masked by the presence of
        pre-existing large aggregates in the earlier work.
        Alternatively it may be that their culture system would
        have shown receptor aggregation at the laminin
        concentration used in the present study (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 nm</NUMEX>).
        Receptor aggregates (spontaneous or induced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">laminin-1</ENAMEX>) are clearly not randomly distributed on a
        nanometer scale. Instead, and like agrin induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, they form discrete nanoaggregates (Figures
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2& 3</ENAMEX>) in a manner termed heterogeneous aggregation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . The alternative, completely consistent with all
        light microscopic evidence, would be a spatially uniform
        and random distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> which are simply at a
        higher density than in membrane not displaying aggregation
        on the micron scale (homogeneous aggregation).
        Notwithstanding this global nonrandom distribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin induced</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates do not show
        evidence of the ordered structure previously found in agrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced</ENAMEX> receptor aggregates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Rather than a
        nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distance profile showing preferred
        distances consistent with a hexagonal spacing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
        the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distances within laminin induced
        aggregates are consistent with an unstructured
        distribution. This difference in ultrastructure parallels
        recent reports suggesting that agrin and laminin induce
        receptor aggregates via different mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] ,
        and confirms our working hypothesis that detailed analysis
        of aggregate ultrastructure can provide important clues to
        aggregation mechanisms.
        With regard to spontaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX>, our
        findings indicate that the weak display of structure
        results not from uniformly weak nanoaggregate ordering, but
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of aggregates. Those characterized by a
        lower density of gold particle label have an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrastructural</ENAMEX> arrangement like that of agrin induced
        receptor aggregates (hexagonal array, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10 nm spacing</NUMEX>),
        while those displaying a higher density are relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstructured</ENAMEX> and are in this respect like the
        nanoaggregates induced by laminin-1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
        Could the presence or absence of orderly nanoaggregate
        structure be accounted for by subtle differences in culture
        or fixation technique from experiment to experiment, or
        over time? If this were true we would have expected similar
        outcomes from laminin induced and spontaneous aggregates,
        which were not observed. Moreover this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> predicts
        that, in the case of our spontaneous aggregate experiments,
        low and high density nanoaggregates would be found on
        mutually exclusive sets of slides. Instead we found that
        individual slides, and indeed individual cell images,
        displayed both low and high density nanoaggregates.
        Therefore we conclude that differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> cannot
        be attributed to unintended variations in treatment, and
        are instead due to real differences in the physiological
        events resulting in aggregation.
        At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance it may seem surprising that it is the 
        lower density nanoaggregates - as
        measured by gold particle density - which present a more
        ordered ultrastructural arrangement. For that matter, since
        the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanoaggregates</ENAMEX> are packed at nearly the maximal
        possible density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , how can other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanoaggregates</ENAMEX> have
        a significantly higher density (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)? The resolution of
        this apparent paradox resides in the distinction between
        differences in gold particle density (which are observed),
        and the underlying receptor density (which must be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inferred</ENAMEX>). As previously reported, the labeling paradigm
        used here precludes the labeling of adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexagonally</ENAMEX> arranged nanoaggregates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . This means
        that gold particle density can actually be increased in
        lower receptor density, unordered aggregates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In
        fact the maximum possible increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor density</ENAMEX> from
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> nm hexagonal array, assuming a receptor diameter of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> nm, is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 33%</NUMEX> - significantly less than that seen
        for the gold particle density differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Thus
        the only interpretation that can be given to our findings
        is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor density</ENAMEX> within nanoaggregates is
        actually higher in those induced by agrin than those
        induced by laminin. Furthermore it is the higher receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> (lower particle density) spontaneous aggregates
        which, like agrin induced aggregates, show a regularly
        ordered structure.
        As discussed previously there is growing evidence for at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mechanistic pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
        these is characteristic of agrin, which involves the
        phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuSK</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as well as the
        colocalization of Œ±-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dystroglycan</ENAMEX>, and in our studies
        produces a regularly ordered structure. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is
        exemplified by the stimulus of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin-1</ENAMEX> which does not
        involve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MuSK phosphorylation or</NUMEX> Œ±-Dystroglycan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colocalization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] , and does not result in an
        ordered structure within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nanoaggregates</TIMEX>. We will denote the
        former as the agrin pathway without caveat, as agrin has
        clearly been shown to play an important physiological role
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synapse</ENAMEX> formation 
        in vivo. The latter we will term the
        laminin pathway for convenience, but with an understanding
        that the term may be misleading as the physiological role
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin</ENAMEX> has not been established. In particular it has
        not been determined whether the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin-1</ENAMEX> is
        instructive or simply permissive with respect to receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>.
        Into the agrin pathway we can add neuraminidase and
        elevated calcium based on the biochemical criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ,
        and competition studies suggest that electric fields also
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX> via the agrin pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 37</NUMEX> ]
        . Other stimuli may later be added to either the agrin or
        laminin pathway, and one prediction from the present work
        is that classification based on biochemical mechanism and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrastructural</ENAMEX> arrangement will be found to be mutually
        consistent.
        This brings us to a consideration of the dichotomous
        nature of spontaneous aggregates with respect to structure,
        and presumably with respect to the mechanism of aggregate
        formation. What is to be made of the existence of these two
        classes of nanoaggregates? The most likely interpretation
        is that low level aggregation occurs spontaneously (laminin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>), and that in a fraction of these events the
        maturation of nanoaggregates then transpires, resulting in
        ordered structure (agrin pathway). The size of this
        fraction is presumed to be smaller than that actually
        detected because the established aggregates are expected to
        have a longer lifetime in the plasma membrane. An
        alternative interpretation holds that spontaneous receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> proceeds along the agrin pathway, producing
        ordered aggregate structure, and that absent some
        confirming signal these decay into unstructured aggregates
        which are then detected as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> and structural data do indeed coincide, this
        would also involve the removal of colocalized
        Œ±-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dystroglycan</ENAMEX> and the dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuSK</ENAMEX> in the
        nanoaggregates environment. In point of fact the unordered
        aggregates detected in our experiments could result from
        both immature and senescent aggregates, although the latter
        would be expected to have very short lifetimes and
        therefore be difficult to detect.
        Finally our present work leads us to speculate, pending
        further results, that the present classification of
        aggregation pathways may also map onto more functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concepts</ENAMEX>, such as "preliminary induction" (the laminin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>) and "maturation and stabilization" (the agrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>; see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] ). This tentative classification
        is based principally on the observation that agrin, in the
        absence of laminin, gives rise to structured receptor
        nanoaggregates, so that it seems in a sense to be a
        complete stimulus, while laminin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> appears to take
        receptors only part of the way toward mature and stabile
        receptor aggregates, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and additional
        criteria already discussed. Others have hypothesized
        alternatively that laminin plays a role in aggregate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stabilization</ENAMEX>, based largely on the difference in mechanism
        and on the longer response time for laminin as opposed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agrin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . These opposing possibilities are equally
        speculative, and their sorting out will require further
        experimental examination.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Receptor rich cell membranes show non-random
        distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> whether they are spontaneous or
        stimulated via agrin or laminin. This confirms the visual
        impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are organized into very dense
        nanoaggregates which are too small to be resolved at the
        level of light microscopy.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Despite the forgoing similarity, the ultrastructural
        arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within nanoaggregates depends on
        their genesis. Agrin induced receptor aggregates lie on a
        hexagonal array with a spacing of ca. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nm, while
        laminin-1 induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microaggregates</ENAMEX> display an irregular or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unstructured</ENAMEX> configuration.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Spontaneous nanoaggregates, taken as a whole, are
        found to be intermediate in degree of order, evidencing
        more ordered structure than laminin-1 induced aggregates,
        but less than agrin induced aggregates. Further analysis
        shows that this is the result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanoaggregates</ENAMEX> in unstimulated cells; a) a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with
        high receptor density and orderly structure, and b) a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor density</ENAMEX> and disorderly
        structure.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Differences in the ultrastructural arrangement of
        acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within aggregates parallel the
        different geneses of aggregation, and provide important
        clues respecting the mechanisms of aggregation.

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hummer II Sputter Coater</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection and quantitative analysis
          Coverslips were examined with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi S-800 Field</ENAMEX>
          Emission scanning electron microscope using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinson</ENAMEX>
          backscattered detector. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> working parameters included:
          accelerating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voltage</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> kv; specimen stage = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> tilt;
          working distance = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm. Cell membrane areas were sampled
          as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Cells were observed at a magnification of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> with both secondary electron imaging and
          backscattered electron imaging (BEI). Cells were selected
          for minimal membrane shrinkage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEI</ENAMEX> background noise.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) These cells were then scanned briefly at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>
          magnification to determine if cell membrane morphology
          was consistent and whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> label was present.
          Subsequently regions of membrane rich in gold-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were scanned as backscattered digital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrographs</ENAMEX>. For the digital montage figure a series of
          overlapping images were taken and subsequently merged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digitally</ENAMEX>. Backscattered electron images taken from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin-1</ENAMEX> treated and control cells were imported into
          Mathematica ¬Æfor quantitative analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> particles
          were located either by eye and computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> or by
          software using image convolution for automated detection
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>). Comparison of the two methods showed no
          significant differences with respect to the reported
          observations. Scale bar lengths were marked by hand to
          convert {x,y} coordinates into a nanometer scale. The
          estimated error from digitization and marking was less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nm.
          The coordinates were used to generate frequency
          histograms of nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distances(see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34</NUMEX> ]
          ). These were compared to data reported previously for
          agrin induced receptor aggregates and to simulations
          found to account for these earlier observations, as well
          as the predicted probability density function for
          randomly distributed particles:
          
          where œÅ is the density, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is the nearest neighbor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, and h is the spatial hindrance (the closest two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> can approach).
          The analysis was also used to identify nanoaggregates,
          defined as a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or more particles which can be
          connected by chords ‚Ä<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¢ 50 nm</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> measurements were
          performed and compared with respect to nanoaggregates:
          size, density, area/perimeter ratio, and diameter ratio.
          Aggregate size is defined as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles
          present. Aggregate density is the number of gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> (not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>) per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œºm 2</NUMEX>. This calculation
          requires a definition of the perimeter - a boundary lying
          somewhere between the points included in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanoaggregates</ENAMEX> and those excluded. A margin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nm from
          included <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was arbitrarily chosen.(see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Because of the necessarily arbitrary rendering of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perimeter</ENAMEX>, the density measurements (and the
          area/perimeter ratio described below) are useful only for
          comparisons within experiments described here. The next
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measurements were designed to characterize the shape
          of nanoaggregates in a dimension indicating more linear
          (tending to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>) or more circular (tending to1). They were
          both employed in the thought that they depend on
          different assumptions about geometry, and might show
          different results. The normalized area/perimeter ratio
          was calculated from the perimeter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) and its encompassed
          area (A) by the equation
          
          The diameter ratio was calculated as the diameter of a
          circle which could just contain the number of particles
          at the measured density (rearranged to minimize the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perimeter</ENAMEX>) divided by the diameter of the smallest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>, centered at the center of mass, which just
          contains the particles in their actual configuration.
          This is calculated as
          
          where A is the observed area and d 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> is the maximal diameter of the
          aggregate. Both of these measures return a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          for perfectly spherical aggregates and approach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX> as
          the aggregates become increasingly linear.
          The significance of the differences between
          distributions was determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson œá 2statistic</ENAMEX>.
          Because of inherent redundancies in nearest neighbor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX>, the data (and simulations) were reduced
          prior to comparison (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>).
