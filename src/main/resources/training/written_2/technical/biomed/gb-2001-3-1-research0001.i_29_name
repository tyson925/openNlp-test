        The most obvious plant characteristic - photosynthesis -
        depends on terrestrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> acquiring, transporting and
        transpiring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to maintain the functional integrity of
        their photosynthetic apparatus, sustain water-splitting
        activity and carry out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide fixation</ENAMEX>. There is no
        growth without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> movement through cells and into and
        out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> vascular system, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are
        severely damaged by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">even a few hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> deficit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evaporation</ENAMEX> is hormonally regulated through stomata, which
        adjust in response to an imbalance between water flux in
        the vascular system and the rate of transpiration. Apart
        from the macroeconomy of water supply and allocation, we
        know little about how water movement is regulated within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and between cells in different tissues. Until
        recently, we were ignorant of the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        facilitating water movement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], although the existence
        of proteinaceous water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> had been
        suggested long ago, and received strong experimental
        support <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The discovery of a family of
        genes encoding these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> channels, now known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aquaporins</ENAMEX> (AQPs), had been anticipated in principle by the
        earlier studies because water permeability, at least in
        some tissues and cells, has characteristics that cannot be
        explained if the lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX> is the sole barrier to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water exchange</ENAMEX> (for reviews see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]).
        In macroscopic terms, water movement through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> had
        long been thought of as a biophysical problem, as a topic
        of capillary resistance in pressurized pipes terminating in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'sprinkler</ENAMEX>' systems - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the stomata</NUMEX> - whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apertures</ENAMEX> adjust
        when responding to changes in hydraulic pressure. A
        combined pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> through the apoplastic (cell
        wall) space and through cells, either transcellularly
        across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>, or through the symplast via
        plasmodesmata, placed little emphasis on membrane barriers
        impeding such movement. Reports of an energy-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> component to water flux and the poisoning of
        water flux by mercurials, however, pointed to additional
        complexity. Nevertheless, the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> channels
        does present a real puzzle, considering that water movement
        through simple lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bilayers</ENAMEX> is significant and the AQPs
        increase conductance by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe 10</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8</ENAMEX>]. Model experiments with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> injected with AQP
        cRNA have amply confirmed that many AQPs do facilitate
        water movement. Most important, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> functions have been
        demonstrated 
        in vivo in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>].
        Aquaporins belong to a group of often abundant membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of molecular mass <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26-35</NUMEX> kDa. They have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        transmembrane Î± helices (TM) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
        membrane-embedded domains. Their amino and carboxyl termini
        are located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The
        amino- and carboxy-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the polypeptide show
        sequence similarity to each other and are arranged as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeat, which apparently originated from the
        duplication of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX>-sized gene encoding three
        transmembrane domains. Each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> bears <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hydrophobic loop
        which includes a highly, though not absolutely, conserved
        Asn-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> (NPA) motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. The loops containing the
        NPA motif, located to the carboxy-terminal side of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TM2</ENAMEX> and
        TM5, respectively, overlap in the middle of the lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilayer</ENAMEX> ('hourglass' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>) and form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hemipores that
        generate a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Erythrocyte CHIP28
        (human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP1</ENAMEX>) was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> AQP shown to form
        water-selective channels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. AQP1 forms tetramers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 19</TIMEX>] but monomers alone can facilitate water flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> high-resolution X-ray structures are now available,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for human AQP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HsAQP1, CHIP28</ENAMEX>) and one for the 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli aqua</ENAMEX>-glyceroporin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP-F</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>], which transports glycerol. The model
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsAQP1</TIMEX> outlines the pore geometry and suggests a
        single-file passage of water molecules while the passage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protons</ENAMEX> is prevented. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> asparagine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX>, both in NPA motifs) form hydrogen bonds with a single
        water molecule, interrupt the hydrogen-bonded file of water
        molecules in the pore, and thus control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> passage. The
        GLP-F structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> whose selectivity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> and pore are different, forming an amphipathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>. The alkyl backbone of the transported glycerol is
        adjacent to the hydrophobic surface and the hydroxyl groups
        form hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic surfaces [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>]. This bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP-F</ENAMEX> is most similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP/SIP</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQPs</ENAMEX>, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> and TIP plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQPs</ENAMEX> are
        more similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> AQPs (see below). GLP-F
        transports ribitol and xylitol at a rate lower than that of
        glycerol, adding an interesting feature to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP-F</ENAMEX>'s possible
        physiological functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP-F structure</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
        consistent with a string of glycerol (or polyol) molecules
        following a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that involves successive hydrogen bonding
        along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and through the pore. Also, induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> changes may determine which metabolites
        (possibly including ions) pass through, providing
        additional flexibility and diversity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP-F</ENAMEX> structure
        also suggests that the center of the tetrameric complex
        might constitute a different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> on its own [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. As
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models become available, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> diversity is
        becoming obvious because, irrespective of overall sequence
        homology, the surface topographies of different AQPs as
        seen by atomic force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microscopy</ENAMEX> seem to vary widely [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. On the basis of deduced amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> and one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallographic</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AQPs</ENAMEX> seem to include
        the same general structural motifs that have been detected
        in mammalian and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AQPs</ENAMEX>. Figure 1presents a
        schematic view of notable domain structures and functional
        features [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 28</TIMEX>].
        After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aquaporin from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (Î³-TIP) was cloned
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> expressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> received
        considerable attention. If functional, their bearing on our
        understanding of the biophysics of water flow across plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> could be significant [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 8, 30</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. New
        evidence indicates that the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> and
        aquaporin-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may not solely, or not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explicitly</ENAMEX>, be in water-flux facilitation. In addition,
        glycerol, urea, ammonia, other uncharged small metabolites,
        and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and ions, seem to traverse
        membranes containing these 'aquaporins' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8, 31</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>]. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> AQPs have been
        characterized using 
        Xenopus oocyte, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, or plant
        protoplast swelling assays. Although such analyses are far
        from exhaustive, the evidence supports disparate water-flux
        characteristics among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>, possibly reflecting the fact
        that their real substrates might be quite different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is unexpectedly large. In
        contrast to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 11 AQP</TIMEX> genes in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 20</TIMEX> expressed AQPs were detected in 
        Arabidopsis by cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> screens
        or RT-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. A growing number of transcripts, detected
        as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), indicated that the
        actual number might be even higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, where at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> have been detected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. With the sequence
        of the 
        A. thaliana (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>) genome
        completed, classical approaches to assessing AQP gene
        complexity can be replaced by analysis of the genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
        We analyzed the 
        Arabidopsis genome sequence for the
        presence of aquaporin-related sequences and summarize what
        is known about this gene and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          The ArabidopsisAQP gene family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> and AQP-like sequences were found in
          the 
          Arabidopsis genome, ranging in size
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 2 to 3</TIMEX> kb. Their positions on chromosomes, accession
          numbers and names are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The nomenclature
          of these genes has been chosen such that established
          names are maintained to a degree, and we label unnamed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative PIPs</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma membrane intrinsic protein</ENAMEX>) as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">putative TIPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tonoplast intrinsic protein</ENAMEX>) as
          TIP, and the various NLMs (for nodulin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-like membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>), whose functions are largely unknown, are put
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> termed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX>, respectively [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]. When aligned and compared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal-X</ENAMEX>/TreeView
          programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>], the deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
          separated into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX>, TIP, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIP</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) that fit with a preliminary consensus on
          nomenclature that is developing among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in this
          field [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 42</TIMEX>]. Included in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2are HsAQP1</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial GLP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> (GLP-F 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ) for comparison. Location
          of the TIP subfamily of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> sequences in vacuole membranes
          has often been documented, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> location is less
          certain and may be variable, depending on the conditions
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 43, 44, 45</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for which the least
          information is available includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> sequences in two
          subfamilies - NIP (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP/SIP</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> show higher similarity to bacterial glycerol
          facilitators than the genes in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Homologies
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis AQPs</ENAMEX>, identity between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> homologs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> subfamily at the deduced
          amino-acid sequence level was found to be highest,
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71.8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.2%</NUMEX>. Thus, the PIP cluster is
          quite distinct and separate from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The TIP subfamily was found to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, with
          intra-group identities ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44.1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93.1%</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with even lower intra-group
          identity scores, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 38.9 and 84.7%</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the fourth</TIMEX>
          subfamily, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SIP genes</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.2%</NUMEX> identical
          to each other. The percent identity between sequences of
          different AQP subfamilies is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately</NUMEX> as low as the
          identity between all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis AQPs</ENAMEX> and the human AQP1
          and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLP-F.</ENAMEX> The range there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.1%</NUMEX>.
          Homology analysis showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.6%</NUMEX>
          identical with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.3%</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.5%</NUMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX>. These findings underscore the overall sequence
          diversity, and could indicate significant functional
          differences.
        
        
          Distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> on the chromosomes
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the distribution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> AQP-like
          sequences on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> chromosomes of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. AQP genes are
          not obviously clustered, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions, which resulted
          from a duplication of segments in chromosomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>,
          respectively, contain a higher than normal density. In
          total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> sequences were located in these two
          regions ( 
          PIP1;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, PIP1</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, PIP2</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, PIP2</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, PIP2</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
          PIP2;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, SIP2</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, PIP2</TIMEX>;8 and 
          TIP1;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> ). The duplication of a
          segment within chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> includes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> in each copy,
          the closely related 
          TIP3;1 and 
          TIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Yet another duplication, on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, harbors 
          SIP1;2 and 
          SIP1;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> AQP
          genes are located within a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones from the ends
          of chromosomes. 
          PIP1;3 and 
          NIP6;1 occupy either end of
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. 
          PIP1;4 is located close to end of
          the short arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          duplications within a short range are obvious; in-tandem
          arrangements are found, namely 
          NIP1;1 and 
          NIP1;2 (chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and 
          NIP4;1 and 
          N1P4;2 (chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>),
          respectively. Whereas the duplications and translocations
          outline mechanisms that have contributed to the evolution
          of the large AQP gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the large number of genes
          and the transcription patterns we found in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX> (see below) seems to argue for specific
          functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Exon-intron structure
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> sequences were also analyzed for distribution
          of introns and exons; the results are shown in Figure
          4and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> subfamilies inferred
          from comparison of the deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> (see
          above) is mirrored in the intron-exon structures. PIPs
          invariably include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> introns. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPs</ENAMEX>, two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> is usual, but several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          TIP2;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, TIP1</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, TIP2</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          TIP2;x-pseudo and 
          TIP1;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> ) have lost intron one. 
          TIP1;3 has no introns at all and no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> or ESTs have been reported for this gene. 
          TIP2;x-pseudo with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intron seems
          to be a pseudogene (see below). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
          characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> introns. 
          NIP2;1 and 
          NIP5;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> lack intron <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron 3</ENAMEX> is missing from 
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIP</ENAMEX> group
          are characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introns. The intron insertion
          positions are different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX> but
          are conserved within a sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, with the exception of 
          PIP2;4 where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron 2</ENAMEX> is located at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same position as the introns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TIPs</ENAMEX>.
          Intron length varies widely in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 to 300</NUMEX>
          nucleotides with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exceptions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introns</ENAMEX> in 
          NIP4;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> are between approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 and 700</NUMEX> nucleotides in length and 
          NIP5;1 is characterized by a first
          intron of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,726</NUMEX> nucleotides. We take the number and
          largely conserved location of the introns as a strong
          support for classifying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. This grouping
          is also consistent with the relative similarity of
          deduced amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> and our analysis of
          transcript abundance (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> and pseudogenes
          Our sequence analyses indicate that certain
          modifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> annotations should be made in the
          genome sequence and also that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> sequences are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>. For 
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> the computer prediction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">omitted exon 1</ENAMEX> and intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A methionine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX> was
          taken instead for the start codon. The proposed change
          adds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 1</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAG31308</NUMEX>). For 
          NIP1;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the amino
          terminus were not included in the published deduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T05028</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]). They have been added on
          the basis of our examination of the homology of these
          residues with those of the closely related 
          NIP1;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The genome annotation has
          already accommodated this change (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CAA16760</NUMEX>). Also, we
          suggest a different splice site for 
          PIP1;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> at the carboxy-terminal end
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAF02782</NUMEX>). Removing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX>
          from the genome-deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> renders the sequence more
          like other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This suggestion is
          supported by cDNA sequences for 
          PIP1;4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMPC; BAA05654</ENAMEX>).
          Upon close inspection, we consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sequences as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">genuine pseudogenes:</ENAMEX> 
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NIP2</TIMEX>;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo, and 
          TIP2;x-pseudo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; Figure
          5a,b,c). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> or cDNA sequences for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          have not been reported. 
          TIP2;x-pseudo seems to encode a
          truncated TIP-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). The
          computer-designed first exon encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> does
          not show any significant homology with corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in other TIPs. The last exon is truncated
          shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM6</TIMEX> owing to an in-frame point mutation,
          which introduces a stop codon at that position. Homology
          with other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> continues beyond this stop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> in a different reading frame for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 32</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid residues</ENAMEX>.
          
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo seems to be a partial
          duplication of 
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The predicted sequence of 
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo corresponds to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">740</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bp</ENAMEX> segment of 
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, which includes the second
          half of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> starting at residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 3</ENAMEX> and
          extending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> bp into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated region (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR)
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). The percentage identity between the
          duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>. A single
          nucleotide deletion at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> of the homologous
          region results in a frameshift and the computer-deduced
          amino-acid sequence uses a start codon located <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          residues upstream from that point mutation. This would
          result in an out-of-frame translation with the 
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -like coding sequence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          residues upstream of the position of the frameshift. A
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221</NUMEX> bp element showing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> identity with fragments of the
          Athila retrotransposon, which is found in the centromeric
          region of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">89</NUMEX> nucleotides
          upstream of the 
          NIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -like region of 
          NIP2;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-pseudo.</ENAMEX> 
          
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo is closely related to
          
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at the nucleotide level and
          apparently resulted from duplication. The identity with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> extends beyond the putative coding sequence to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,300 bp</NUMEX> upstream and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 bp downstream</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 to 94%</NUMEX>. However, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> including exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> and parts of
          introns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 4</NUMEX> was found to be missing from the 
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>).
          The computer-designed 
          NIP3;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-pseudo last exon (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">132</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX>) uses a different reading frame downstream of
          the conserved exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site and extends beyond the
          conserved region for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 90</TIMEX> amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>.
          One interesting facet is that each of these three
          genes or pseudogenes contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hydrophobic regions
          that could form transmembrane helices. Also, each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> retains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPA</ENAMEX> domains, and thus, if
          translated, they might constitute shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          AQP-like functions. Such 'three-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">TM-</ENAMEX>spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> with AQP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX>' have been reported from 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although
          recent reports suggested that they might be pseudogenes [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. Also, polymorphisms in AQP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, including
          frameshifts leading to truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, have been
          reported in different laboratory strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. Only
          transcript analysis and a functional investigation of the
          putative encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will answer questions about a
          possible function of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> or
          otherwise altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Transcript abundance
          From an analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 120,000</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ESTs</ENAMEX> included in the
          public databases, a distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> transcripts
          emerged that provides a rough measure of their abundance,
          with the caveat that the tissues from which libraries
          have been generated are not sufficiently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>.
          Also, tissue specificity as it is deduced from cDNA
          library history does not provide information about the
          expression in specific cells of the tissue (for example [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>]). The findings are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, from which
          it is clear that abundant transcripts predominantly
          belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TIPs</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PIPs</ENAMEX> are represented in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> tissue, and many are found in high numbers
          in roots ( 
          PIP2;2 and 
          PIP2;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> seem to be expressed
          exclusively in roots) and in green siliques (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed pods</ENAMEX>).
          Similarly, most TIPs show a broad tissue distribution.
          The abundant transcripts for the genes 
          TIP1;2 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> ESTs), 
          TIP2;2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70</NUMEX>), 
          TIP2;1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79</NUMEX>) and 
          TIP1;1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">180</ENAMEX>) are highest in roots.
          Comparatively few transcripts, not exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> for any
          of them, have been found for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP/SIP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in
          the TIP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> no cDNAs have been reported. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> have
          been detected for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that we considered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> (or 'short' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>). The pattern of
          transcription inferred from numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> does not
          conform to any simple functional assignment. It seems
          that some AQPs carry out functions that are common to
          many tissues. Others seem to be reserved for more
          specialized tasks, and the function of yet others,
          represented by rare transcripts, could be required only
          under specific conditions or in very few cells, which
          might not have been sampled by the available cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Promoter regions
          In the absence of systematic studies targeting AQP
          regulatory elements, our knowledge of the expression
          characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> comes almost
          exclusively from the representation of transcripts in
          cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The regulation of transcripts
          in response to light or temperature, osmotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, high
          salinity, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> deficit, or in expanding cells in and
          adjacent to meristems, in developing siliques, during
          embryo and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> formation or in flower structures,
          requires further investigation. We carried out an 
          in silico analysis of the 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 kb</NUMEX>)
          upstream of the coding regions, and found a few putative
          cis-regulatory elements. If any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX>, they seem to be for the control of circadian
          and/or diurnal rhythmicity, light-regulated expression
          and the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myb</ENAMEX>-type transcription factors. In
          fact, diurnal expression changes in root aquaporin
          expression have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Similar elements are
          also present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesembryanthemum AQP</ENAMEX> gene promoters
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.Q.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.J.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). The
          literature on AQP expression - on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> in more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> - supports tissue-specific expression,
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> in cells and tissues strongly
          involved in water conduction, and control by hormonal
          signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 36, 51</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>, auxin, light and circadian
          rhythms have been shown to affect expression of
          individual or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 36, 52, 53</TIMEX>].
          Our sequence analysis also revealed a mutator-like DNA
          element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">178 bp</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> initiation
          codon of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIP1</ENAMEX>;2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). 
          TIP1;2 is the most highly expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> among the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ESTs</ENAMEX>. As the 
          MudrA transposase sequence of this
          element, which is adjacent to the 
          TIP1;2 sequence, is transcribed
          from the opposite strand, it seems that the 
          TIP1;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> basal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is either
          extremely compact or that intra-transposon sequences
          serve a regulatory function.
          We note that there has been insufficient experimental
          work to allow a thorough comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in different plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The protein
          encoded by 
          AtPip2;2 is most closely related to
          
          McMipB from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. crystallinum</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>). In
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McMIPB</ENAMEX> is highly expressed in the
          root vasculature although not in the primary meristem of
          the root [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McMipB</ENAMEX> is transferred into either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> (to drive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-glucuronidase</NUMEX> (GUS) expression) or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> (to drive green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) expression), this expression

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.W. Galbraith</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). There is,
          however, no recognizable sequence conservation between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> plant

          Deduced proteins
          From our examination of the genomic sequence, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis AQPs</ENAMEX> are predicted to
          be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 240</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIP1</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NIP3</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This range compares to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">269</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for
          HsAQP1 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">281</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> GLP-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F. Of</ENAMEX> exceptional
          length are the yeast Fps1p (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NP013057</NUMEX>) and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila BiB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAF52844</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 669</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">696</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, respectively, in which
          the amino-terminal portions show homology with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>. In
          the deduced amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> we found little
          variation in the length of loops between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMs</ENAMEX>,
          variations are largely restricted to the amino terminus
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>; see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> were
          observed to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different amino-terminal extensions,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one approximately 50</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second approximately 30</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid residues</ENAMEX> longer than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> with the
          shortest amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIP1</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, SIP2</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). Amino termini
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPs</ENAMEX> are predicted to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> long.
          Sequence analysis showed a higher variability in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP/SIP</ENAMEX> classes. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX> there is no extension,
          the putative start of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM1</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          downstream of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
          NIP5;1 has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 70</NUMEX> additional amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> and shorter extensions of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          residues characterize others in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Among those,
          the amino terminus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NIP6</TIMEX>;1 has some characteristics of
          a mitochondrial signal peptide sequence - a series of
          positive charges separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to four</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> could form an amphipathic helix, but no
          studies have been carried out on the function of this
          sequence.
          An analysis of the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions
          and of loops that connect the putative TM helices did not
          reveal any obvious domains. One characteristic specific
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> seems to be that the amino-terminal
          region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> is invariably terminated by a
          string of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proline residues</ENAMEX>. It is highly probable
          that this would affect the orientation of the amino
          terminus with respect to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but a
          function, if any, for such a domain is not known.
        
        
          Inferences about functionally important AQP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues</ENAMEX>
          The characteristics of a water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          that distinguish a true water facilitator from a glycerol
          facilitator have previously been analyzed by comparing
          sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> with known functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. That
          comparison resulted in the identification of a few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invariant</ENAMEX> or nearly invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> and
          glycerol facilitators on the basis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX> sequences
          ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> but including <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few</NUMEX>
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQPs</ENAMEX>. We applied this analysis to the entire 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis AQP</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and
          the results are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> and TIP classes
          were found to fall clearly in the 'AQP-type' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Recently, another indicator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> has been
          pointed out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TM6</NUMEX> - the conservation of a (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y/F</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L/I/W</ENAMEX>)
          pair in this helix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. All TIPs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> were found to
          show the pair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FW</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
          found to contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YW residues</ENAMEX> in this position, but only
          further experiments can show whether these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are
          sufficient to locate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the tonoplast or
          whether they might be determinants of substrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NIP7</TIMEX>;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YM</ENAMEX>, whereas the
          remainder of sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> include (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/I</ENAMEX>)
          in this position, which might assign them to the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIP</ENAMEX> subfamily characters
          emerge that are a composite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLP</ENAMEX> groupings,
          and the subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIP</ENAMEX> shows even stronger similarities to
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. We found that the pore-defining
          NPA motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] are absolutely conserved among the
          predicted amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> and TIPs but vary
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX>. This may also be significant in
          determining substrate selectivity.
          Phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> have been identified in several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> by Johansson 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. They identified
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (indicated in bold type below) in a
          loop following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> NPA motif (

          Sensitivity to mercurials is characteristic of some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsAQP1</TIMEX>, the cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that confers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C189</TIMEX>, adjacent to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> NPA motif,
          but no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> shows a cysteine in this position
          although effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> have been documented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in many studies. The cysteines responsible for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> poisoning of water flux in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtTIP2</TIMEX>;1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C116</NUMEX>) and
          AtTIP1;1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C118</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>] were found in the predicted
          sequences of all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis TIPs</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is
          located in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM4</TIMEX>, downstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> NPA motif. A
          cysteine was found in all PIPs at a similar position
          along the deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. It does, however,
          not occupy a similar three-dimensional position (assuming
          that the TIP and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP TM</ENAMEX> are similar); this means that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX> would point in a different direction
          from that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TIPs</ENAMEX>. In fact, other studies have shown that
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PIPs</ENAMEX> are mercury-insensitive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 60</TIMEX>].
        
        
          A combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> and modeling approach to analyzing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> tissues
          Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> water-channel activity is tested by the
          oocyte swelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], in which 
          Xenopus oocytes expressing AQPs are
          exposed to hypo-osmotic shock and the subsequent water
          influx is measured. Apart from the caveats mentioned
          above, the level of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>, that is, the
          number of active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> in the oocyte plasma membrane, is
          often not known and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> might even not be targeted
          to this membrane in oocytes. These limitations can,
          however, be addressed by measurements of membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and oligomerization state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61, 62</TIMEX>]. TIPs
          have been reported to be more 'active' in these
          experiments, which suggests that they might have a higher
          conductance 
          in vivo and/or that their structure
          is more compatible with the oocyte expression or
          targeting machinery. Other techniques use artificial
          membranes into which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> are embedded, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> in
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> is overexpressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>] or isolated plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protoplasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Important advances in studying water movement at the
          cell and tissue level include the use of pressure probes
          for roots and for individual cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>]. The effects of
          a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> have been addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense</ENAMEX> experiments
          that measured changes in xylem pressure and compared
          water permeability of protoplasts from control and
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">antisense</ENAMEX> AtPIP1;2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIP1b</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Because the movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and plant
          tissues involves several barriers, including apoplastic,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symplastic</ENAMEX> and transcellular ones, a single set of
          measures of overall hydraulic conductivity, although
          useful, is not sufficient for determining how particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> function 
          in planta .
          Although informative, the results of pressure-probe
          experiments require careful interpretation, and
          independent nondestructive ways of measuring water fluxes
          are desirable. Such methods are available but have been
          little used so far for analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> functions. Nuclear
          magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (MRI) allows the
          distribution of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to be quantified, and also
          allows the mapping of flow and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diffusion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65, 66, 67</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68, 69</TIMEX>]. The potential for directly discriminating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> and extracellular water signals in plant
          cells and root tissues has been shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>] and this
          opens the door to spectroscopic and imaging-based
          measurements of water flow 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.S-H</ENAMEX>., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H. Wang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.J.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          results).
          The separation of intracellular from extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water NMR</ENAMEX> signals is restricted to roots or other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, such as some stems, which have elongated cells
          oriented in parallel [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>] and is illustrated in Figure
          6for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> roots. The assignment of the two signals to
          represent the total intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the total
          extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, including the apoplast, has been
          confirmed by the selective imaging of intracellular and
          extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> using this approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>]. NMR
          spectroscopic applications enable the rates of osmotic
          shrinkage and swelling to be measured 
          in situ and also enable measurement
          of transport of small molecules and ions 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>].
          We found that the total intracellular water signal
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) shrinks in response to osmotically driven
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efflux</ENAMEX> when the tissue is exposed to hypertonic solutions
          (with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> or sucrose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">perfusate spectra</ENAMEX>; data not
          shown). The advantage here is twofold: the isolation of
          the intracellular signal removes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoplastic tracer</ENAMEX> from
          the data; and, in contrast to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> methods using
          shift reagents, the movement of any small molecule that
          gives an NMR signal can be followed (this includes any
          molecule containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>, nitrogen or nonlabile
          hydrogen atoms).
          It has also been reported that the method illustrated
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6allows</NUMEX> diffusional water fluxes to be measured
          by isotopic or magnetic labeling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>]. Diffusional
          gradients are not the ones that drive water movement in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, but diffusional measurements, especially in
          combination with hydraulic ones can be very informative
          about the barriers responsible for regulating water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluxes</ENAMEX>. The 
          in vivo NMR isotope flux data
          available from this approach were obtained by following
          the time course of the intracellular 2H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> signal after switching between
          unlabeled buffer and buffer containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tracer</ENAMEX> levels of
          added D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spectra</ENAMEX> giving rise to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7afor</NUMEX> hydroponically grown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> have a high time resolution (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 seconds</TIMEX>) and high
          signal-to-noise ratio. This means that rapid processes
          can be followed and a complete influx and efflux dataset
          is collected from one root sample, with each sample
          acting as its own control. This means that simple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mathematical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, embodying different hypotheses about
          the location and magnitudes of barriers to water movement
          through the root, can be tested by using them to generate
          fits to the isotopic flux data. An example of a 'first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>' approach to modeling water movement is shown
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7b</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fluxes</ENAMEX> generated by this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were
          shown to fit kinetic data and such a fit is shown in
          Figure 7a(see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), where it is
          apparent that the data were well accounted for by a model
          that has separate barriers to water movement at the
          exodermis, endodermis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between one</NUMEX> cell layer and the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX>. In the model illustrated in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7b</TIMEX>, the relative
          volumes correspond to the anatomically determined
          locations of exodermis, endodermis and number of cell
          layers in the roots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize seedlings</ENAMEX>. This simple model
          was found to be sufficient to account for widely
          differing time courses of water movement from plants
          grown under a range of conditions that affect water
          transport (data not shown). As cell-to-cell water
          movement is likely to be controlled by the permeabilities
          of the plasmalemmal and tonoplast membranes, the
          parameter corresponding to this permeability potentially
          provides a noninvasive measure of membrane water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductivities</ENAMEX> in intact tissue. In combination with
          transcript and protein expression data, which also
          monitor cell specificity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> therefore has the potential
          to test ideas about aquaporin function 
          in planta by combining localization
          information with modeling of flux measurements from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> grown under
          conditions that alter both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> conductivity and AQP
          expression.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Intracellular</ENAMEX> locations of AQPs
          The original definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> and TIP subfamilies
          was their assumed location in the plasma membrane and
          tonoplast, respectively. When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">locate proteins</ENAMEX> of the TIP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the signal was always
          confined to tonoplast membrane fractions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>]. PIP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> seems less well defined. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Daniels</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX>] located a PIP-family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the plasma membrane in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. crystallinum</ENAMEX>, Barkla 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIPs</ENAMEX> to a
          small extent in the plasma membrane but mostly in a
          vacuolar fraction in continuous sucrose gradients or,
          more likely, in a membrane fraction with a density
          similar to tonoplasts. This is not surprising considering
          that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> have been documented as cycling
          between the plasma membrane and internal vesicles, a
          process that seems to be under hormonal control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>]. Such mobility may also be at the basis of the
          distribution of different TIPs in distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> vacuoles
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61, 76, 77</TIMEX>]
        
        
          Functions of AQP
          We have outlined how the genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> can provide new
          information, taking the aquaporin gene and protein family
          as an example. There are, however, limits on what can at
          present be deduced from gene sequences alone. The
          fundamental questions of whether the primary role of all
          or most AQPs is in increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> conductivities, and
          what physiological functions such water permeability
          increases may serve in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> function, are not settled.
          They can only be addressed by functional measurements.
          The straightforward view that most aquaporins in plants
          are there to regulate water flow, and a subset may
          facilitate the movement of glycerol or other small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, is the most widespread general interpretation
          of the physiological and functional assays outlined at
          the start of this article. This dogma is expounded more
          thoroughly elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 30, 31, 32, 36</TIMEX>]. This view, in
          fact, conceals a number of quite different roles for
          water-channel activity, involving the regulation of water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flux</ENAMEX> and homeostasis at the subcellular, transcellular,
          tissue and whole-plant levels. Therefore, there are two
          levels at which functional questions must be addressed
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX>. One is whether each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> functions as a
          water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, and it seems that a significant number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPs</ENAMEX>, for example, do not in fact greatly increase the
          water conductivity of the cell membranes in which they
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reside</ENAMEX> (at least not in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">oocytes</TIMEX>; see for example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>]). In reality we are ignorant about the natural
          substrates for most AQPs.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> level of question that requires nongenomic
          information is: if water-channel activity is significant
          for a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX>, what is the role of this activity
          in a whole-plant context. A simple example concerns the
          location of gene expression. The simple statement that a
          particular gene is expressed in roots, for example,
          conveys insufficient functional information, as different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> have different distributions within one tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>]. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> expressed in the epidermis is unlikely to
          function in vascular flux. Although our understanding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domains</ENAMEX> that determine expression
          and localization is growing, our ability to deduce from
          genomic sequences which cell types are likely to express
          a particular gene and where the product will reside under
          what conditions is still rudimentary. Thus direct
          determination of the location of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> within tissues
          is still required to understand its function in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
          The water-channel view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> function requires us to
          believe that there may be something about some PIPs that
          prevents them displaying their normal water-channel
          function in oocytes. This and other considerations
          arising from the imperfections of oocyte expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX>] call for functional measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> to be
          made primarily in plant cells or tissues. Assays on plant
          protoplasts, roots and whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are obviously
          important, and here the question is how the contribution
          of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> is to be determined. Such measurements
          generally rely on mercurials to perturb AQP function, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercurials</ENAMEX> can act in a nonspecific way on membranes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and not all AQPs are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury-sensitive</ENAMEX>, so this
          is not sufficient.
        
        
          A path forward: reverse genetics and biophysical
          investigations
          The use of gene knockout and/or antisense technologies
          is particularly appealing for plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQPs</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
          this approach has been used to reveal which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> and
          combinations thereof are, and are not, crucial for water
          fluxes 
          in vivo in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking the genes
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AQP1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AQP3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>]. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case where it has
          been applied, lowering AQP expression by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtPIP1</TIMEX>;2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtPIP1b</NUMEX>) antisense expression resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with
          root systems that were larger but pressure probe
          measurements indicated the same overall xylem pressure as
          the smaller root systems of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>].
          Protoplasts from these antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> showed lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water permeabilities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          We believe that applying a combination of biophysical
          measures of conductivity to transgenics involving each of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>, and combinations of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX>, represents
          the most promising approach to the fundamental unanswered
          questions about general and individual AQP functions. By
          including whole-plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> relations and also metabolite
          measurements, the use of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, preferably of
          the 'gene knockout' type, will yield a greater
          understanding and prevent errors of interpretation that
          could arise from simply correlating single-gene knockouts
          with changes in hydraulic conductivity parameters.
          Only by addressing in a systematic way the functions
          of each AQP 
          in planta will it be possible to
          understand such simple but puzzling issues as the reason
          behind the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. The
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> in the 
          Arabidopsis genome - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> - compares
          with the presence of, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> potassium channels
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proton</ENAMEX>/metal antiport systems in the 
          Arabidopsis genome. More detailed
          comparison with animal systems only increases the puzzle.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> only AQP1 appears to be widely distributed in
          different tissues (although several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> are
          expressed as rare transcripts in various tissues),
          whereas the data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2show</ENAMEX> that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> are expressed at significant levels in multiple
          tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. We suggest that the reason for the large
          number of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQPs</ENAMEX> will turn out to be that multiple
          genes represent multiple functions, of which water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>. Thus we postulate that plant
          genomes evolved more AQPs than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> because in plants
          they serve functions that are either not required or are
          met by other systems in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          Such functions may include metabolite permeation. As
          with the water permeability of most AQPs, permeability to
          a particular metabolite does not mean that this is a
          meaningful function 
          in planta. Thus the permeability of
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> to ribitol and xylitol, as found for a bacterial
          glycerol facilitator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], cannot be significant in
          cells where these metabolites are not present. Indeed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> in one species may have a very different
          role in another. Thus there is good evidence that
          glycerol permeability is important in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>] in the secretion of this polyol under stress
          conditions, but in higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that do not accumulate
          glycerol as an osmoprotectant nor excrete it in large
          quantities, there is no apparent function for increasing
          glycerol permeability. One might speculate that by
          increasing membrane permeability to polyols and/or other
          metabolites, some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> AQPs could be involved in
          long-distance apoplastic transport or signaling rather
          than in the bulk secretion of, for example, glycerol. The
          discovery of such possible functions will require 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">planta</TIMEX> examination of transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and an extension of analyses beyond highly
          selective water and small-molecule permeability assays in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterologous</ENAMEX> systems and protoplasts.
          Biophysical measures of water movement 
          in planta - whether based on
          pressure probes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> or other methods - as well as
          methods for determining localization and expression and
          for generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">transgenics</ENAMEX> are available. A relatively
          neglected area is the development of quantitative
          anatomical models of water movement for interpreting flux
          measurements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX>]. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are needed for testing
          the potential contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> to regulating water
          content and transport, and indeed for determining which
          of the range of plausible but untested ideas about AQP
          function may or may not apply to different membranes,
          cells, tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and environmental conditions. The
          combination of localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP proteins</ENAMEX> and using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">anatomically</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, has the potential to allow
          function to be assigned to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">AQPs</ENAMEX> using mutants
          and transgenics in which expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQPs</ENAMEX> (singly or in
          combination) is reduced or eliminated.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Studying genome sequences yields unique and useful
        information about unstudied and understudied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The
        aquaporin gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> is an interesting example
        of the current and potential limitations of this approach.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> sequence comparisons allow the assignment of the AQPs
        into subfamilies to be placed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> footing, and have
        functional implications for previously unknown genes. While
        we know about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP</ENAMEX> sequences, structure, expression,
        post-translational modification, permeability properties
        and subcellular location from some case studies, our
        ability to extrapolate from gene sequence to functional
        properties for unstudied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
        still limited. One limitation is that we cannot yet
        extrapolate reliably from sequence via three-dimensional
        structural features to conductivity, selectivity and other
        protein properties. This inability extends to regulatory
        regions that determine place, time and extent of transcript
        expression, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein characteristics</ENAMEX> that determine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">half-life</ENAMEX>, intracellular localization and membrane
        trafficking. This type of limitation will decrease as our
        understanding of sequence-structure and structure-function
        relationships improves and as our knowledge of expression
        and cellular targeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> expands. This means that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> information will become more useful in the coming
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and analyses such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> presented here are
        likely to become common and more useful.
        Irrespective of our steadily improving predictive tools
        for 
        in silico analyses, fundamental
        questions of the physiological roles of individual genes
        will continue to require detailed functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX>. Here
        too, genomic information is important because, as we have
        argued above, assigning physiological function via
        transgenic reduction or removal of gene expression requires
        sequence information for precise targeting. Here, the AQP
        family provides an ideal opportunity. This is a set of
        genes whose functions are intuitively perceived as
        important, much isolated information has been accumulated,
        yet their function is far from being understood. Also, AQPs
        pose challenges because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is likely to contain
        genes with divergent and unique biological roles in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. Indeed it is likely that in many cases individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have different roles, depending on
        when and where they are present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. Clearly, this
        level of understanding will require a combination of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome</ENAMEX> and transcript analysis
          
          Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>) aquaporin coding sequences were identified by
          searching the 
          Arabipdosis genomic data at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>] with the BLAST algorithms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX>]. Intron-exon splicing
          sites were verified visually using available cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and/or corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Information Resource</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX>) website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX>] was used to localize 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aquaporin genes</ENAMEX> on the
          chromosomes. Sequences were aligned with the pile-up
          program of the GCG software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Genetics Computer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> package). Tree <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was performed with ClustalX
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] and drawn with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TreeView</ENAMEX> software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
          Transmembrane regions were determined with the
          transmembrane prediction program TMpred [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87, 88</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Growth of seedlings
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Maize seeds</ENAMEX> (FRB-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>) were germinated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> on
          trays on absorbent paper wetted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaSO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">28Â°C</NUMEX> in a humidified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX>.
          Seedlings were then transferred to hydroponic growth on
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 cm</NUMEX> thick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam</ENAMEX> sheets (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> cm diameter holes)
          floating on aerated growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>. The primary root of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedling</ENAMEX> was threaded through a hole in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam sheet</ENAMEX> into the growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>. Hydroponic
          growth was under continuous illumination at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">28Â°C</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidified</ENAMEX> air and growth solutions contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaSO</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> .
        
        
          Preparation for NMR
          Tips <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 mm long</NUMEX> were excised from each primary root and
          discarded. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The next 25 mm</TIMEX> of primary root was then cut
          and briefly vacuum infiltrated under reduced pressure to
          improve magnetic field homogeneity of 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo spectra</ENAMEX>. Root segments were
          placed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> mm NMR tubes with their axes aligned
          parallel to the tube axis and perfused with aerated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buffer solutions</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          mM potassium-gadolinium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylethylsulfonate</ENAMEX> (MES) at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> with or without <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> The gadolinium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gd</ENAMEX>) was used to
          separate intracellular from extracellular signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>]
          and is complexed to prevent toxicity. The composition of
          the perfusion medium was designed to keep the free [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gd</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>+] below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M, while having [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM and
          below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM. No toxicity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> root tissues was
          observed by 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo 31P</TIMEX> NMR spectroscopy of
          root tips or segments exposed to the perfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> for
          several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, and the growth of excised root tips and
          roots of intact seedlings was the same over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h in this
          medium as in medium without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gd</ENAMEX> or EDTA. The perfusion
          system used has been previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>].
          Perfusion rates of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-40 ml per min</NUMEX> were used.
          One-dimensional-pulse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1H and 2H</TIMEX> NMR spectra were
          acquired as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>] using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unity</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> spectrometer with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mm broadband <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tracer</ENAMEX> experiments, time courses of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150-300 2H spectra</ENAMEX>
          were acquired at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15 sec</TIMEX> intervals. The
          intensities of intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2H</ENAMEX> signals were measured
          from these spectra and normalized to final equilibrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> (for influxes) or initial intensities (for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effluxes</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Model for the analysis of water flux data
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> illustrated in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7assumes</TIMEX> that water
          diffusing radially through the root encounters several
          barriers. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parameters of this model correspond
          to rate constants (or permeabilities) of the exodermis
          and the endodermis, as in model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, with additional
          barriers for movement between cell layers, similar to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">model 3</ENAMEX>. The rate of change of concentration for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n th</ENAMEX> compartment is given by a set
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> equations
          
          in which 
          C 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           is the concentration in layer 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           is the rate constant between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n th</ENAMEX> and the ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n - 1</ENAMEX>)th cell layer. The
          permeability for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> movement between successive cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX> is assumed to be the same for all layers except
          for those for movement from the external medium into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">root</ENAMEX> (across the exodermis) and movement from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> layer, which are separated by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endodermis</ENAMEX>. Therefore the all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> values except for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> have the same value scaled by
          dividing by the relative radius of each cell layer. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scaling</ENAMEX> is because the rate constant for crossing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> or other barrier is equal to the permeability of
          that barrier multiplied by the area-to-volume ratio, and
          the area-to-volume ratio for an elongated cylinder is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/</NUMEX>(radius). Solution of this set of equations was
          implemented using a spreadsheet computer program.
