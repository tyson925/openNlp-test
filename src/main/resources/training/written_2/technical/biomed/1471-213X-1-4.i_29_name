        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loxP</ENAMEX> site specific recombination
        system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] is widely used for production of
        tissue-specific and conditional knockout alleles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Recently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX>-dependent 
        lacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R26R</NUMEX>) was
        produced by targeted insertion of a lacZ gene, preceded by
        a loxP-flanked (floxed) strong transcriptional termination
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tpA</ENAMEX>), into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. The 
        R26R <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> terminates transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prematurely</ENAMEX>, but when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are crossed with
        Cre-expressing transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>-mediated excision
        of the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive 
        lacZ expression. Thus, these doubly
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> express 
        lacZ only in the cells that have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expressed Cre</ENAMEX>, as well as in all of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells.
        Similar Cre <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strains have been produced using
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to express 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lacZ</ENAMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] ], Another
        variation on this theme has been the development of the
        Z/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strain, which switches from lacZ to alkaline
        phosphatase expression upon exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase
        activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are useful for
        monitoring the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase, as well as
        for cell lineage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tagging</ENAMEX> experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ]
        ].
        Here, we describe the production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similar Cre
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter alleles</ENAMEX> that express enhanced yellow or cyan
        fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (EYFP or ECFP), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> color variants of
        the green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> and its variants
        are autofluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can be visualized in
        living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, and are therefore particularly useful for
        monitoring gene expression in whole embryos, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or
        cultured cells and organs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> were chosen
        because their emission spectra overlap minimally, so they
        can be distinguished when used simultaneously, whereas the
        emission spectra of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> overlap to a greater
        extent with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clontech</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/gfp/pdf/LivingColors.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>.
        During the course of this work, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new Cre <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        strains that conditionally express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> were reported. Two
        transgenic strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>] use the β-actin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>/CMV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancer</ENAMEX> to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>-mediated excision of
        a stop sequence, and in one of these, lacZ is expressed
        prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>-mediated excision event. In the third
        strain, which is similar in principle to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YFP</ENAMEX> and CFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> reported here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> was inserted at the 
        ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The availability
        of different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strains will be valuable, not
        only because of the advantages of different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but also because the efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>-mediated
        excision may be dependent on the target locus.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the 
        ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> for expressing various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in a ubiquitous manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 21</ENAMEX>], we generated
        a generic targeting vector (pBigT), into which any sequence
        of interest can easily be inserted downstream of a floxed
        neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tpA cassette</ENAMEX>, and then subsequently cloned into a
        plasmid with the 
        ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> was inserted into pBigT, and the
        resulting sequence was inserted into a vector containing 
        ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> sequences to permit
        homologous recombination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). The targeting vector was
        electroporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> G418-resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were analyzed for each construct. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> R26R-EYFP
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> R26R-ECFP <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> carried the targeted allele, as
        determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blot hybridization</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">targeted ES</ENAMEX> cells, originally derived from strain <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129X1/SvJ</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], were injected into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> blastocysts, and the
        resulting chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were bred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> to
        pass the mutation through the germ line. Thus, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resulting mice</ENAMEX> were a mixture of strains 129X1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/SvJ</ENAMEX> and
        C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/6J.</ENAMEX>
        No background expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> or ECFP could be
        detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R26R-EYFP</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R26R-ECFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as expected
        (data not shown), due to the strong transcriptional stop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence</ENAMEX> inserted between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and the coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. However, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reporter mice</ENAMEX> were crossed to
        β-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">actin-Cre</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], which express Cre
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> in most or all cells including those in the
        early embryo, the resulting doubly transgenic embryos
        displayed apparently ubiquitous expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> or ECFP
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), indicating efficient excision of the floxed
        stop sequence. The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> could be
        clearly distinguished using appropriate filter sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This ubiquitous expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> or ECFP was
        heritably transmitted to the following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> (data
        not shown), resulting in ubiquitously expressing lines of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that will be useful for lineage tracing in chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> or embryos, analogous to the original <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ROSA26</NUMEX> lacZ
        promoter trap strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        The specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R26R-EYFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> lines was
        tested by crossing them with strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that express
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> in a tissue-specific fashion. Isl1 is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIM</ENAMEX> homeodomain
        transcription factor expressed in motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and dorsal
        root and cranial sensory ganglia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Isl1-Cre <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
        produced by targeting 
        Cre into the 
        Isl1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        Methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterozygous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Isl1-Cre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were viable and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertile</ENAMEX>, while homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> died at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E9-E10.5</ENAMEX>, as has
        been previously described with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which the exon
        encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LIM domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Isl1</TIMEX> had been deleted [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. Figure 3Ashows an experiment in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R26R</NUMEX>-YFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were crossed with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Isl1</NUMEX>-Cre <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, resulting in
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> in motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and dorsal root ganglia
        in the doubly transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. Thus R26R-YFP <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        faithfully report the cell-specific patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isl1/Cre</ENAMEX> in
        subsets of neurons. As a control, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Isl-1/Cre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
        also mated to the original 
        R26R <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lacZ allele</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], resulting in a
        similar pattern of expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lacZ</ENAMEX> .
        Engrailed-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">En-1</ENAMEX>) is a homeodomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed
        specifically at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-hindbrain</TIMEX> junction of the early
        somite stage embryo, as well as in a number of sites later
        in embryogenesis. Figure 4shows an experiment in which
        R26R-YFP <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were crossed with a strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which
        Cre was knocked into the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">En-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], resulting in the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YFP</ENAMEX> specifically at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-hindbrain</TIMEX>
        junction in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E8.5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>. For comparison, we also crossed
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">En-1/Cre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the original 
        R26R <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lacZ allele</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], resulting in
        lacZ expression in the same region at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E8.5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4C</ENAMEX>).
        The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> proved more difficult to detect
        in fixed and sectioned tissue (data not shown), although it
        was clearly detectable in unfixed embryonic tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
        2C). This is not surprising, given the higher quantum yield
        and extinction coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX>,
        both of which result in higher fluorescence intensity.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express EYFP</ENAMEX> or ECFP only in cells expressing the Cre
        recombinase, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells, by targeting these
        cDNAs into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>,
        preceded by a 
        loxP flanked "stop" sequence. Crosses
        with a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cre</ENAMEX> expressing strain (βactin-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        tissue-specific Cre <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Isl1-Cre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">En1-Cre</ENAMEX>) showed
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strains function as expected, based on
        their similarity to the well characterized R26R-lacZ
        strains. In contrast to 
        lacZ expression, which cannot be
        easily detected in living tissue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> and ECFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">reporter strains</ENAMEX> (together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> strains
        currently available) will be very useful for monitoring the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> in living tissues, or tracing the lineage
        of these cells and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX>, in cultured embryos
        or organs. Furthermore, by using modified forms of Cre
        whose recombinase activity is inducible, one can use these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reporter mice</ENAMEX> to perform detailed analysis on the lineage
        of cells at different time points during development.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> of Plasmids
          The components of the 
          ROSA26 targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> were a
          gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Soriano</ENAMEX>. The adenovirus splice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>) and bovine growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> polyadenylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (bpA) were from plasmid pSAβgeo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The 
          loxP flanked neo cassette, and
          trimer of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> polyadenylation sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tpA</ENAMEX>), were
          from plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGKneotpAlox2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The 
          ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> sequence and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diphtheria toxin</ENAMEX> (DTA) expression cassette were from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pROSA26-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and the template for the external
          probe used to genotype <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was from plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pROSA26-5</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">plasmids pEYFP-N1</ENAMEX> and pECFP containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech Laboratories</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Targeting Constructs</ENAMEX>
          The plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pBigT</ENAMEX> consists of the adenovirus splice
          acceptor sequence followed by a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loxP</ENAMEX> site, neo expression cassette,
          strong transcriptional stop sequence (triple SV40
          polyadenylation sequence), another 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loxP</ENAMEX> site in the same orientation
          as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, a multiple cloning site (MCS), and the
          bovine growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyadenylation sequence</ENAMEX>. A PacI
          site was included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AscI</ENAMEX> site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' to
          the bpA. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> are rare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> base pair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cutters</ENAMEX> and result in sticky ends upon digestion and can
          be used to excise the entire construct, for insertion
          into the plasmid with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ROSA26</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genomic arms</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XbaI</ENAMEX> site
          used for insertion into the 
          ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic locus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] was
          replaced by a linker (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI, SwaI, AscI</ENAMEX>), so that it could
          be digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AscI</ENAMEX>, and receive the bigT
          sequence.
          To make pBigT, plasmid pSAβgeo was digested with ClaI
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XbaI</ENAMEX> to remove the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">βgeo</ENAMEX> and bpA sequence but leave
          behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>, the ends were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klenow</ENAMEX> filled and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">plasmid</ENAMEX> self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was digested
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PstI</ENAMEX> to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCS</ENAMEX>, which was
          replaced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> linker. The resulting plasmid was
          called pPacSA.
          Next, pSAβgeo was digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacI</ENAMEX> to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>
          and 
          βgeo sequences, but leave behind
          the bpA, and self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was
          digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XbaI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApaI</ENAMEX> to remove most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' MCS
          (except for the terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX> site), which was replaced
          with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">AscI</ENAMEX> linker. The resulting plasmid was called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pbpAAsc</ENAMEX>.
          The 
          loxP - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">neo -tpA-</ENAMEX> 
          loxP was excised from plasmid
          PGKneotpAlox2 by cutting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI, Klenow</ENAMEX> filling, and
          then cutting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX>. This was inserted downstream of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> in pPacSA digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SalI, Klenow</ENAMEX> filled, and
          then cut with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCS</ENAMEX> containing the restriction
          sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XhoI, ApaI, SacII, NotI, SacI, EcoRV</ENAMEX>, and KpnI
          was synthesized and inserted downstream of the second 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loxP</ENAMEX> site by digesting the DNA with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XhoI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX> and ligating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCS</ENAMEX>, which had been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> to have compatible cohesive ends. This
          plasmid was called pSAleotpA. The bpA sequence along with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AscI</ENAMEX> site was excised from pbpAAsc by digesting it
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KpnI</ENAMEX>, and inserted downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCS</ENAMEX> in
          pSAleotpA by digesting it with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX>. The
          resulting plasmid was called pBigT, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MCS</ENAMEX> contains
          sites for the restriction enzymes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NheI, SalI, AccI, XhoI</ENAMEX>,
          ApaI, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacII, NotI, SacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BclI</ENAMEX>.
          To make the 
          ROSA26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> sequence compatible
          with the pBigT plasmid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pROSA26-1</ENAMEX> was digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XbaI</ENAMEX>,
          Klenow filled and a linker (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI, SwaI, AscI</ENAMEX>) inserted.
          This plasmid was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pROSA26PA</ENAMEX>.
          To make the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R26R</NUMEX>-YFP targeting construct, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYFP</ENAMEX> cDNA was excised from pEYFP-N1
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApaI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI</ENAMEX> and inserted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BigT</ENAMEX> digested with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApaI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI</ENAMEX>. BigT was then digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> and AscI
          to release the entire floxed 
          neo -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tpA</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EYFP</ENAMEX> assembly, and inserted into
          pROSA26PA digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AscI</ENAMEX>. This plasmid was
          subsequently linearized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX> and used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>.
          To make the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R26R</NUMEX>-CFP targeting construct pECFP was
          digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AgeI, Klenow</ENAMEX> filled then digested with NotI
          to excise the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> cDNA. This was inserted into
          BigT digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XhoI, Klenow</ENAMEX> filled, and then digested
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI</ENAMEX>. BigT was then digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AscI</ENAMEX> to
          release the entire floxed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neo-tpA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, and
          inserted into pROSA26PA digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AscI</ENAMEX>. This
          plasmid was subsequently linearized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX> and used
          for electroporation.
          An appreciable amount of recombination was observed
          while trying to grow up the final targeting vector,
          resulting in an aberrant plasmid of smaller molecular
          weight. Therefore, the mixture of theses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plasmids was
          digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KpnI</ENAMEX> which linearized both plasmids, and
          the correct targeting vector was gel purified. It was
          subsequently confirmed to be the correct targeting vector
          by diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, restriction digests and sequencing
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Targeting of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ROSA26locus</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JM-1 ES cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] were expanded by culturing on
          feeder cells in medium supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 15 ×</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 6cells</TIMEX> were electroporated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          μg of each targeting vector and grown without feeders
          under selection in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 μg/ml G418</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>. 96
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were picked and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> screened, for
          electroporations with each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two constructs</NUMEX> R26R-YFP
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R26R-CFP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic Southern blot</ENAMEX> hybridization was
          performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRV</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> used detects a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> kb wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> kb
          targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, due to the presence of an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRV</ENAMEX> site
          in the targeted allele.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> carrying the targeted allele were genotyped by
