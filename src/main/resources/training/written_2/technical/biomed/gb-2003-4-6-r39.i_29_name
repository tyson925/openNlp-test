        Nematodes are the most abundant and speciose metazoans,
        and account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 80%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nematodes</ENAMEX> have evolved to occupy diverse
        ecological niches. Like the well-studied 
        Caenorhabditis elegans , most are
        free-living and graze on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> or detritus, and as such,
        have no obvious direct impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Others, however,
        are adapted as parasites and are responsible for such
        widespread problems as human disease, debilitation of
        livestock and crop damage. Plant-parasitic forms are
        responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $100 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>
        damage worldwide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The most damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heteroderidae</ENAMEX>) includes the root-knot ( 
        Meloidogyne spp.) and the cyst ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globodera</ENAMEX> and 
        Heterodera spp.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX>. Root-knot
        nematodes penetrate plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and migrate between the
        cells in roots, where they induce formation of large
        multinucleate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> called 'giant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>'. Galls form around
        the giant cells, and the roots become distorted, often
        leading to compromised root function and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> of
        plant growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        It is not clear which genetic differences between the
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parasitic</ENAMEX> and non-parasitic forms may be responsible
        for conferring parasitic ability. On the basis of
        phylogenetic analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] it appears that plant
        parasitism arose independently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times over
        the course of nematode evolution. Consequently, one cannot
        be assured that any gene or set of genes that aid in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">parasitic</ENAMEX> lifestyle in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will also exist
        in another. Conceptually, several mechanisms affecting
        evolution to parasitism can be envisioned. These include
        adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pre-existing genes</ENAMEX> to encode new functions;
        changes in genes regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolic</ENAMEX> or developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>; gene duplication; gene loss; and acquisition of
        genes from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (horizontal gene transfer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> has become a widely accepted mechanism of rapid
        evolution and diversification in prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Recent genome analyses of primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>,
        such as the sea squirt ( 
        Ciona intestinalis ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and
        single-celled parasitic diplomonads [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , implicate HGT
        events in early eukaryotic evolution. In contrast, the
        extent of horizontal transfer involving higher eukaryotes
        has been controversial, with many cases of hypothesized
        horizontally transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] having
        been refuted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        On the basis of biochemical and immunological criteria,
        genes have been identified in 
        Globodera rostochiensis and 
        Heterodera glycines that allow these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> to endogenously produce enzymes that can degrade
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cellulose</ENAMEX> and pectin, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major components of plant
        cell walls. A possible ancient bacterial origin of these
        genes has been theorized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . A bacterial origin
        for a number of root-knot nematode (RKN) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also has
        been proposed, although their possible role in parasitism
        is less clear. Some, such as a gene encoding chorismate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , were likewise identified on the basis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> properties, whereas others, including a
        polygalacturonase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , were identified from
        expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) datasets, the latter from our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] using a keyword search. Veronico 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] isolated a presumed
        polyglutamate synthetase gene with bacterial homology by
        sequencing neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> artiellia chitin synthetase locus.
        We wished to determine whether other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RKN genes</ENAMEX> might have
        been acquired by horizontal gene transfer, particularly as
        such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might potentially be related to parasitism.
        Claims of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> have frequently pivoted on incongruencies
        between a particular gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and the assumed underlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">species tree</ENAMEX>. Acquisition of new sequence data has often
        revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> believed to be absent in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were
        merely missing in the database rather than missing from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Obviously, because full genomes are not
        available for all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>, we are not able
        to make definitive statements about the presence or absence
        of a particular gene in every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. However, with the
        completed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome available as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference 'model</ENAMEX>' nematode, it is now possible to examine
        the emerging genetic resources for 
        Meloidogyne comprehensively, to begin
        to address the question of evolution of parasitism and, in
        particular, a possible role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>.
        A similarity to a bacterial protein sequence is the
        simplest criterion for considering a nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and
        thus the gene that encodes it, as a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>.
        For that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> truly to define an HGT event, its
        presence must be incongruent with nematode phylogeny
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, the presence of a gene in one
        nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> ) but its absence in
        another (such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans ) might merely reflect a
        gene loss in the latter lineage. In addition to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , several other
        invertebrate genomes have been completely sequenced, and at
        the time of this study, the best characterized of those was
        
        Drosophila melanogaster .
        Consequently, we chose this resource as a tool to identify
        genes which may be present in nematodes, but which are
        absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>-like gene
        present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> and 
        Drosophila , but absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , is unlikely to have
        experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, but may rather reflect a gene loss in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">elegans</ENAMEX> lineage. We therefore
        developed a 'phylogenetic filter' based on these
        relationships to rapidly reveal 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> identified
        by sequence similarity to bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The intent of
        this filter is to efficiently eliminate spurious HGT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
        Surprisingly, the relationship between the invertebrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phyla Nematoda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthropoda</ENAMEX> (which includes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ) is controversial. The
        traditional view is that arthropods are more closely
        related to annelids than to nematodes, but some recent
        molecular phylogenies place nematodes and arthropods
        together in a high-level taxon named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ecdysozoa</ENAMEX>, which does
        not include annelids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Other molecular studies
        give conflicting results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . Regardless of the
        evolutionary relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nematoda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthropoda</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drosophila</ENAMEX> remain useful and valid
        models for our analyses, and the relationships shown in
        Figure 1are consistent with both hypotheses.
        Genes that were transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to nematodes
        would pass through our phylogenetic filter if the transfer
        event occurred subsequent to the divergence of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
        Meloidogyne lineages (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Should a gene appear to be present in other closely related
        plant parasites, such as the cyst nematodes, the transfer
        event probably affected a common ancestor of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of parasitic nematodes (event 'a' in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Alternatively, the transfer event may be more recent, such
        as to the progenitor of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> lineage since its
        divergence from the cyst nematodes (event 'b' in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
        or in a lineage leading to a single 
        Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (event 'c').
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>-like 
        Meloidogyne genes that are not
        present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Drosophila</ENAMEX> comprise a preliminary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, multiple gene loss may be responsible
        for the presence/absence pattern revealed by the filter. To
        test this more thoroughly, we established a screen to
        compare the now small pool of preliminary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with
        all other sequences in the public databases. The most
        parsimonious explanation to be drawn from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with
        no significant matches to any metazoan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is that they
        arose by horizontal gene transfer from a non-metazoan pool,
        as opposed to multiple independent gene losses in the
        metazoan lineages. Candidates thus identified were
        subsequently validated through phylogenetic analysis of
        relationships between the most similar matches from our
        screening processes
        We describe here a comprehensive two-step search for HGT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> javanica and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> hapla using <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome</ENAMEX>-to-genome comparisons were made to discover
        patterns of presence and absence that would indicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizontally</ENAMEX> acquired genes. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>-wide
        comparisons further reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pool; these genes
        were then examined from an evolutionary standpoint. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were
        discovered and their potential role in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> pathogenicity
        is discussed.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome</ENAMEX>-to-genome comparisons act as a phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> searching
          Given the large number of sequences to examine and the
          expectation that most were not horizontally acquired, we
          developed a phylogenetic filter based on genome-to-genome
          sequence comparisons. Further, because the available data
          included raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
          Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> (dbEST) as well
          as clustered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parasitic Nematode</ENAMEX> Sequencing
          Project [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 28 29</NUMEX> ] , for which the data can be presumed
          to be significantly more reliable, we wished to compare
          the efficiency of reducing each dataset with this filter.
          
          Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dbEST</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> hapla sequences, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMj</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMh</ENAMEX> respectively) were translated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> frames and
          individually compared to conceptual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-phase
          translations of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          Drosophila genomes as well as all
          available bacterial sequences. This first filter, which
          makes no assumptions about gene annotation in the target
          genomes, and which employed the relatively error-prone
          raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX>, reduced the pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> by
          eliminating <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 99%</NUMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> for all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> species tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Using clustered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica sequences, named WMi
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX>) as queries to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>, fly and bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein databases</ENAMEX> (which are based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene annotation</ENAMEX>)
          produced a similar degree of reduction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> previously predicted to be the result
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> events were identified by, and passed through, the
          phylogenetic filter (see below).
          The main objective of the phylogenetic filter was to
          reduce the computational load necessary to screen HGT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> against all metazoan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>, consisting of a BLAST analysis against the
          GenBank nonredundant (nr) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database, served to
          eliminate genes that may have been independently lost in
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          Drosophila lineages, but are still
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a more ancient animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This filter eliminated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> data
          set. Examination of these showed a putative copper
          homeostatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function,
          both with significant matches to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> (e-values of 1.10e
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-23and 4.20e -18respectively</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> aldehyde dehydrogenase
          with a significant match to 
          Mus musculus (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2.70e -26</ENAMEX>) and one
          asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> had best
          matches to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, manual
          inspection revealed that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> did have
          significant matches to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , but passed through our
          initial phylogenetic filter because the bacterial matches
          were stronger than those for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 final</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> had no significant match to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> in the preliminary
          screen. The best eukaryotic matches to these candidates
          from the BLAST search against nr are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> filter generated similar enrichment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX>,
          reducing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>.
          The fact that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from the raw datasets
          were eliminated during second-round filtering (for
          example, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99 to 27</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMi</ENAMEX>) reflects the redundancy in
          the datasets. If multiple <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences representing a
          single gene pass through the first filter, each of those
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences will be in the preliminary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pool.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> filter is likely to simultaneously remove more
          than one of these homologous sequences if it removes any
          at all. Therefore, searching with raw <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences is
          likely to result in a larger absolute decrease in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate number</ENAMEX> than will searching with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">clustered EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          The number of final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">candidate HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> after clustering. A smaller number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> was discovered from the raw <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> datasets
          compared with the clustered sequences, which suggests
          that our method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> searching is partially
          dependent on sequence quality. The lower number of final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> obtained using raw <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data is principally due
          to filtering of areas of low complexity and tandem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repeats</ENAMEX>, and uncertainty of similarity matching for
          shorter sequences during BLAST searches. Similarly, the
          size of the dataset influences the number of final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> obtained. Thus, the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. hapla</ENAMEX> is likely to be due to a
          combination of the small number of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> analyzed
          (because of redundancy in the data), and possibly overall
          quality of the raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX>, rather than to a lack of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laterally</ENAMEX> acquired genes in the genome. Despite the
          lowered efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> discovery when using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lower-quality</ENAMEX>, raw <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequences</TIMEX>, this tool was able to
          recover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMi</ENAMEX> dataset, compared to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> identified from the higher-quality
          clustered sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> dataset. The fact that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were discovered across disparate
          sequence-quality conditions not only provides additional
          validation of our methods, but also suggests a high
          degree of flexibility and robustness in the tool.
        
        
          Identification of previously hypothesized HGT
          candidates
          The literature reports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> postulated to have
          been horizontally acquired by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> hapla or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica during evolution of
          plant-parasitic nematodes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] ; our search
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">algorithm</ENAMEX> revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of these genes. The notable
          exception is 
          Mj-CM , which is postulated to
          encode chorismate mutase in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . To examine why
          this gene was not identified by our filtering process, we
          used both 
          Mj-CM sequences found in GenBank
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AF095949, AF095950</ENAMEX>) in a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> queries. No
          significant matches were found in the 
          Drosophila , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans or bacterial databases,
          nor in the 
          Meloidogyne datasets used in this
          study. Recent BLAST searches at nematode.net [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          against all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne ESTs</ENAMEX>, including
          sequences not available when our analyses were first
          conducted confirm that the chorismate mutase gene is
          absent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX>, although a single, significant
          match to an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> arenaria chorismate mutase <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          was revealed. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RKN</ENAMEX> gene also postulated to have
          been acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, and which encodes polyglutamate
          synthetase, was previously identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> artiellia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
          Significantly, hybridization data showed that this
          particular gene is absent from both the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. rostochiensis genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
          We speculate that acquisition of this gene by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. artiellia</ENAMEX> is a recent HGT event
          (event 'c', Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and thus it is truly absent from
          the 
          Meloidogyne genomes from which our
          datasets were derived. In other words, failure to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'discover</ENAMEX>' this gene was not a failure of our screening
          process, but is likely to be a correct reflection of the
          biology.
          The most extensively studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding</ENAMEX> β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>-endoglucanase, initially identified
          in the cyst nematodes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> rostochiensis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> glycines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene Contig IDs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MI00537</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MI01011</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MI01381</ENAMEX> and
          MI01842) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] appear to define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of paralogs
          formed before divergence of the cyst and root-knot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX>. As noted [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] , β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>-endoglucanases
          presumably equip these nematodes with the ability to
          endogenously degrade the most abundant component of cell
          walls, namely cellulose. Similarly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most
          abundant component of cell walls (pectin) is the assumed
          target of nematode-encoded pectate lyase and
          exo-polygalacturonase, both functions also postulated to
          have been acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>. The pectate lyase gene
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI00592</NUMEX>) was identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> rostochiensis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> glycines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and the
          exo-polygalacturonase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI00252</NUMEX>) was identified in our 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
          Because of the obvious role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nematode genes</ENAMEX> that allow
          endogenous production of cell-wall degrading enzymes in
          attacking a plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, it has been hypothesized that
          their acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> may have been key steps in the
          evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-parasitic nematodes from ancestral
          free-living forms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In that model, an intermediate,
          symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of a soil-dwelling (but
          free-living) nematode with a soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> possessing
          these enzymes is postulated before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> event. It was
          suggested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] that acquisition of these new functions
          (either by symbiosis or HGT) permitted previously
          free-living nematodes to expand their range into a new
          ecological niche (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>) as a prelude to speciation
          into parasitic forms.
          Also revealed by our tool were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>,
          including homologs for glutamine synthetase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-threonine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aldolase</ENAMEX> and 
          nodL , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to which function
          could not be unequivocally ascribed.
        
        
          Rhizobial origin of Meloidogynegenes
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> newly identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> have
          highest similarity to genes in the nitrogen-fixing soil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that nodulate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> roots and which are
          collectively termed rhizobia. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> and rhizobia are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sympatric</ENAMEX> (that is, they share an ecological niche in the
          soil [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and arguably in the plant too [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ),
          satisfying the minimal requirement for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> to occur,
          namely physical proximity. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of
          bacterial evolution suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> as a mechanism of
          adaptation into either symbiosis or parasitism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          This is specifically thought to be the case for divergent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of rhizobia, such as the symbiont 
          Sinorhizobium meliloti and the
          pathogen 
          Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly
          known as 
          Agrobacterium tumefaciens ), where
          differential selection and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> maintenance is likely to
          be responsible for different lifestyle strategies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
          .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> revealed by our
          filters, which encode an L-threonine aldolase gene
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI01644</NUMEX>) and a deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI00109</NUMEX>), exhibit striking amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity to
          rhizobial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48% and 51%</NUMEX> respectively), but a
          complete absence of meaningful homology with any
          eukaryotic sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Consequently, these genes
          are strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for having entered nematodes via
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, presumably from a rhizobial ancestor.
          The deduced product of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita gene (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI00426</NUMEX>) has
          striking sequence similarity to glutamine synthetase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS</ENAMEX>). Glutamine synthetases fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> structurally
          and functionally distinct classes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX>, which to date
          appears restricted to prokaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , is involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium assimilation</ENAMEX> as part of the nitrogen-fixation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> in rhizobia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The ability to be reversibly
          adenylylated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tyr397</NUMEX> of the active site is a
          characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSII</ENAMEX>, is found
          in all eukaryotes and a small number of prokaryotes, and
          appears to be involved in purine synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSII</ENAMEX> is not adenylylated (and lacks the
          conserved tyrosine). On the basis of both amino-acid
          sequence similarity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] HMM
          search (e-value 4.3e <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-24</NUMEX>), it is clear that the RKN
          glutamine synthetase is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX> homolog, implying a
          prokaryotic origin. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, the nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has
          greatest similarity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX> from
          the rhizobial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, 
          Mesorhizobium loti , including
          conservation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tyr397</TIMEX>. The best match to a eukaryotic
          glutamine synthetase (GSII) is substantially lower (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), strongly implicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RKN</ENAMEX> gene as a robust
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for an HGT event.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> rhizobial-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MI01045</NUMEX>)
          identified by our filter has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8.8e -54</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NodL</ENAMEX> from 
          Rhizobium leguminosarum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encodes an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetyltransferase</ENAMEX> previously
          thought to be present only in rhizobia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , where it
          functions in the biosynthesis of Nod factor. Nod factors
          are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhizobial species</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          lipo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">chito</NUMEX>-oligosaccharides which function in signal
          exchange between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> and its symbiotic partner
          plant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The first visible signs of nodule
          formation (root-hair deformation) as part of the
          symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> are triggered by Nod factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] ,
          and although the specific mechanisms of Nod factor
          function remain unknown, it is clear that it has a
          central role in initiation of cell division and possibly
          also nodule differentiation in the root [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . For most
          rhizobia, the product of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodD</ENAMEX> acts as a transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> and induces expression of a set of 
          nod genes. Experimental evidence [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] shows that lack of either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodABC</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodD</ENAMEX> in rhizobia results in a Nod
          -phenotype (that is, a strain unable to initiate nodule
          formation on the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>). By contrast, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> radiobacter , which forms a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasitic</ENAMEX> relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> by producing a crown
          gall rather than nodules, lacks these genes, and appears
          to possess only 
          nodL , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodX</ENAMEX> and 
          nodN , suggesting these three 
          nod genes are sufficient to affect
          root growth and are involved in a parasitic lifestyle
          rather than being specific to symbiosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
          To examine further the relationship between putative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> found in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica with the cognate genes
          in rhizobia, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis and
          found that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nematode genes fall squarely within
          the rhizobial 
          nodL clade (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          analysis further grouped other sequences with significant
          similarity to the deduced 
          Meloidogyne NodL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Not
          surprisingly, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> clustered according to
          specific enzymatic function of the different classes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetyltransferase</ENAMEX>. Significantly, the solitary
          significant match of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meloidogyne NodL</ENAMEX> sequences to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryote</ENAMEX> is to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast serine</ENAMEX>-acetyltransferase, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> clearly separated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RKN</ENAMEX> by function as well
          as in our phylogeny (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Bayesian analysis of the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid alignment</ENAMEX> confirms
          this grouping. The posterior probability of the two 
          Meloidogyne sequences being most
          closely related to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other eukaryotic sequence,
          from 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is
          estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Instead, a group consisting of the two
          
          Meloidogyne sequences along with
          the 
          Sinorhizobium meliloti and 
          Rhizobium leguminosarum sequences
          is estimated to have a posterior probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>. For
          the clade consisting solely of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rhizobial and the
          two 
          Meloidogyne sequences, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> probability is estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 0.657</NUMEX>, and
          almost all of the remaining posterior probability is
          accounted for by adding the 
          Streptomyces coelicolor sequence to
          this clade of rhizobial and 
          Meloidogyne sequences.
          Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed
          from the 
          Meloidogyne sequence we have
          attempted to amplify 
          nodL from a range of nematode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. For each of the 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tested
          (including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. hapla</ENAMEX> ), we have been able to
          confirm the presence of the gene. However, similar
          experiments do not yield amplification products from the
          cyst nematodes we tested. Although other interpretations
          can be made, these results are consistent with 
          nodL being acquired by an 'event b'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Meloidogyne nodLtruly is a nematode gene
          A question that arises in analyzing eukaryotic
          sequences with strong matches to bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          especially when the match is unique, is whether the gene
          in question truly was isolated from a eukaryote, or
          whether it represents a prokaryotic contaminant (any
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> matches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> to prokaryotes, which
          probably would be contaminants, were removed before
          database submission [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ). Claims of nematode genes
          having been acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 23</NUMEX> ] have
          addressed this issue in a number of ways. To provide
          experimental evidence that the 
          Meloidogyne nodL sequences
          represent nematode loci, we cloned and sequenced a
          full-length transcript from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> ( 
          Mi-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NodL</ENAMEX> ). Identification of the
          SL1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans -splice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end
          of the message [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , and a poly(A) tail at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end,
          confirmed that this is a 
          bona fide nematode gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Analysis of genomic 
          Mi-NodL sequences revealed an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), further reinforcing the notion that
          this gene is integrated within the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita genome.
          In cases of a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>, it has been suggested that
          the nucleotide composition of the transferred gene might
          reflect that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> species rather than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">recipient species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . To establish a baseline
          nucleotide composition of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita transcripts, we
          calculated the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content for our entire 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> (WMi) sequence
          dataset, obtaining a value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.3%</NUMEX>. By contrast, the
          average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhizobial species</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with the average for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of 
          Mi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NodL</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>. This value is
          strikingly different for the 
          nodL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          Rhizobium leguminosarum (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>)
          and 
          Mesorhizobium loti (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>). We
          similarly examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> HGT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, and found the values to be consistently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> .
          Another way to consider nucleotide composition is
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage. In particular, we considered how
          similar the 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage is to that
          of a 'typical' rhizobial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by using the codon
          adaptation index (CAI) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . From an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum codon-usage table,
          we calculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAI</ENAMEX> for those amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> precisely
          conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mi-NodL</ENAMEX> and the rhizobial NodL protein
          to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.621 and 0.703</NUMEX> respectively. To evaluate the null
          hypothesis that the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage between the two 
          nodL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is identical, the
          difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAI</ENAMEX> values was adopted as a test statistic.
          The observed value of this test statistic was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.082</NUMEX> and
          its null distribution was approximated by simulating
          10,000 datasets as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods.
          Because the absolute value of the test statistic
          calculated from the simulated datasets exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.082</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 62</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times, we reject the null hypothesis of
          identical expected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum nodL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in these genes is significantly
          different between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Collectively, comparison
          of the nematode and rhizobial 
          nodL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> suggests that each is
          adapted for function in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in which it resides,
          and despite the high degree of similarity between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> sequences of these genes, the DNA sequences
          are strikingly different.
          From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ochman</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , in which
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C and codon bias are diagnostic for HGT
          events, it might be argued that our findings on the base
          composition of bacterial and nematode sequences are
          inconsistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>. However, analyses in which synteny
          and phylogenetic information were also considered suggest
          that codon bias and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content are poor indicators of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . A role for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'amelioration'</ENAMEX>, whereby
          structural characteristics of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are
          eventually homogenized to resemble those of the recipient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, has been assumed, but the rate was postulated to
          be the same as the rate of random, forward mutation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          ] . In addition to alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage (as
          reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content), for a bacterial gene to
          function efficiently in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nematode</ENAMEX> presumably requires
          acquisition of regulatory elements (including a promoter)
          and structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (including a poly(A) tail and,
          optionally, a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans -spliced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>). Other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (such as introns) might also be acquired. It is
          possible that a careful phylogenetic analysis comparing
          rates of evolution of 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> acquired by HGT
          with those present in the more ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">nematode</ENAMEX> lineage,
          might shed light on the rate of amelioration of gene
          structure following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter-kingdom HGT</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> from rhizobia
          In the absence of an assembled genome sequence for 
          Meloidogyne , it is not yet
          possible to examine conserved, genome-wide gene order of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> between nematodes and the hypothesized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bacterial donor</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, because the origin of many
          of the nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> appeared to be rhizobial,
          we wished to investigate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homologs</ENAMEX>. Unlike many prokaryotes, in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genome</ENAMEX> resides largely on a single, circular chromosome,
          with varying numbers of small episomes, rhizobial genomes
          are typically organized in a manner conceptually more
          like eukaryotes. 
          Sinorhizobium meliloti , for
          example, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> large, single-copy plasmids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] ,
          and the primary 
          Mesorhizobium loti chromosome is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX>. Rhizobia have the ability to transfer genes
          horizontally to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. loti</ENAMEX> carries a 'symbiosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">island</ENAMEX>' which spans <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9%</NUMEX> of its genome and
          has been shown to have a role in rhizobial evolution via
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . This symbiosis island contains certain genes
          involved in nodulation and nitrogen-fixation functions,
          but none of these is a homolog of the nematode HGT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> we have identified. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of these
          genes do map to the same 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> loti linear chromosome (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodL</ENAMEX> and the glutamine synthetase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, both of which are involved in nodulation/nitrogen
          fixation in rhizobia. Together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-threonine
          aldolase homolog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are found
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">257 kb</NUMEX> of each other, a distance that represents
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.65%</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> loti chromosome, which is less
          than half the size of the symbiosis <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, of unknown function, lies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 149</NUMEX> kb
          from the opposite side of the symbiosis <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> from the
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly, examination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colinearity</ENAMEX> and gene arrangements between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. meliloti</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> radiobacter and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> loti indicates that the location
          of the genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. loti</ENAMEX> probably represents a more
          primitive state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] and is therefore more likely to
          reflect the proximity of these genes in rhizobial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ancestral species</ENAMEX>. Although it cannot be known if these
          genes were acquired in a single transfer event between a
          rhizobial ancestor and an ancestor to 
          Meloidogyne , remnants of the HGT
          event (other than the already identified genes) may
          remain, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are currently being mapped into
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita genome to examine
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synteny</ENAMEX> with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> loti . BLAST analysis of the
          genes in the intervening span of chromosome indicates
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> significant matches to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> (WMi) data set, all
          with significant matches to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , that is, they are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have demonstrated that a high-throughput
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioinformatics</ENAMEX> approach based on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences is an
        efficient and effective way to identify possible HGT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-parasitic nematodes. Previous reports
        of horizontally acquired genes have been based mainly on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> or immunological criteria. Using an informatics
        approach, we rediscovered previously identified candidates
        (thus validating our method), and were able to identify new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, a common theme underpinning
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> is their apparent direct relationship to
        the parasitic lifestyle of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Also striking was
        our finding that phylogenetically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhizobia</ENAMEX> appear to be
        the predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of 'donor' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. This is
        significant for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. First, root-knot nematodes and
        rhizobia occupy similar niches in the soil and in roots,
        and thus the opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> may be omnipresent.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, both organisms establish intimate developmental
        interactions with host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and mounting evidence
        suggests that the mechanisms for these interactions are
        also shared [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . It seems a reasonable hypothesis that
        the origin of parasitism in 
        Meloidogyne may have been facilitated
        by acquisition of genetic material from soil bacteria
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">horizontal</TIMEX> transfer. Indeed, such events may have
        represented key steps in speciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-parasitic
        nematodes
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Available data
          Sequences were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parasitic</ENAMEX> Nematode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing Project</ENAMEX> (PNSP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] including clustered 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne ESTs</ENAMEX> built with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene</ENAMEX> approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,799</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> (WMi) sequences and
          3,119 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. javanica</ENAMEX> (WMj) sequences from
          these PNSP clusters. Additional raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> were
          extracted from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 31, 2002</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">NCBI GenBank</ENAMEX> dbEST build
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Entrez Search</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retrieval System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] . 
          Meloidogyne incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica datasets from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> (NMi
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMj</ENAMEX> respectively) contain the individual ESTs
          generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNSP</ENAMEX>, and from which the clusters for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX> datasets were generated. In addition, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMj</ENAMEX> datasets included some sequences from sources
          other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNSP</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. hapla sequences</ENAMEX> (NMh) were also
          retrieved from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>. Entrez was used to extract all
          available nuclear sequences for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and bacterial sequences
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> non-redundant (nr) database (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1, 2002</TIMEX>

          Candidate search algorithm
          Analyses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX> data were performed via a
          local installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST 2.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Each sequence
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMj</ENAMEX> was extracted into individual FASTA format
          files using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts and submitted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-phase translated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-BLASTX</ENAMEX> searches, once each

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and bacterial protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-BLASTX</ENAMEX> parameters were E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> =

          query sequence in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> searches.
          
          Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI
          were analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tera-BLAST Hardware Accelerated</ENAMEX>
          BLAST algorithm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TimeLogic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NV</ENAMEX>). Single

          Tera-TBLASTX queries against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-phase translated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          Drosophila genomic databases.
          Tera-TBLASTX parameters were Open Penalty = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, Extend
          Penalty = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, Word Size = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Query Increment = 3</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neighborhood Threshold</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts were employed
          to parse the query name and associated best e-value from
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> analyses (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> each for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMj</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMh</ENAMEX>).
          As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of phylogenetic filtering, automated
          comparison of e-values for each sequence allowed us to
          eliminate sequences with a best match to either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans or 
          Drosophila from further analysis.
          The remaining sequences, those with a best match to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of order 1.0e <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-10or</TIMEX> better, provided a
          preliminary pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for each dataset. A BLASTX
          search was carried out for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> against the nr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, using the above parameters. The results from
          this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> filter were examined and any sequence with a
          significant match to a metazoan other than a closely
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-parasitic nematode was removed from further
          analysis. An e-value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.0e -10was</ENAMEX> the threshold used to
          declare a match. The remaining sequences provided our
          final set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for horizontally transferred
          genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> alignment of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum nodL sequences was
          trimmed such that only identical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> remained,
          and the sequences back-translated, retaining the correct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten thousand</NUMEX> pairs of simulated sequences
          were generated by independently permuting the homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> pairs in the actual data. In other words, the
          probability that the 
          i th codon in the first simulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was assigned the 
          i th codon from the actual 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita sequence and the 
          i th codon in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> simulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was assigned the 
          i th codon from the actual 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> leguminosarum sequence was set
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and the probability that the 
          i th codon assignments in the
          simulated sequences were reversed was also set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>.
          Codon adaptation indices were computed for each simulated
          sequence using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBOSS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of sequence analysis
          tools [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Phylogenetic analysis of candidates
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> for the top
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> matches with an e-value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0e -10or</NUMEX> less were
          extracted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> search against the nr database.
          If there were not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> matches with an e-value meeting this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX>, all sequences with e-values lower than 1.0e
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10were</NUMEX> selected. Alignments of these sequences with the
          translated candidate sequence were constructed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] ; improvements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALX</ENAMEX> alignments
          were performed manually. Sequences from the same species
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX> identity after alignment were
          considered possible paralogs and deemed redundant
          information for this analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> sequence from
          each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> was used in further analysis. Poorly
          aligned sequences were also discarded.
          Distances between aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were estimated with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayhoff</ENAMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> replacement <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Tree
          topologies were then inferred from these distances via
          neighbor-joining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> non-parametric
          bootstrap replicates were used to estimate clade support
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Maximum likelihood analysis produced topologies
          consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining analysis. All
          phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> and PAML software packages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] .
          Additional analyses of the putative 
          nodL gene were conducted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 3.0b4</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MrBayes</ENAMEX> software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . For these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thornton</ENAMEX> model of amino-acid
          replacement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] was adopted and variation of
          replacement rates among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was incorporated by a
          discretized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rate categories
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> analysis used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          heated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and employed a burn-in period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
          cycles, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990,000</NUMEX> additional cycles.
          Convergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was diagnosed by
          performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different runs from different initial
          parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Prior distributions for all parameters
          were the default distributions incorporated in the
          MrBayes software.
