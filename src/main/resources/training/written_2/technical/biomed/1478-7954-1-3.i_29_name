        The prevalence of chronic conditions such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypertension</ENAMEX>, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> (CHD) in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> demand
        substantial medical resources [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, these
        conditions are becoming increasing common among the
        well-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in middle and low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        While the quality of life and health of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is
        adversely affected by chronic conditions, there is a
        concomitant loss in work productivity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . This is
        especially important for middle and low-income countries
        where skilled labor is relatively scarce and the treatment
        of chronic conditions may entail a reduction in health care
        resources available for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> afflicting the poor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . A preventive approach to chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is therefore
        appealing.
        Population surveys covering a large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHANES</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] can provide
        useful insights into risk factors for chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        However, the gradual evolution of the multiple risk factors
        and the onset of chronic diseases cannot be addressed using
        cross-sectional data. By contrast, longitudinal studies
        such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham Offspring</ENAMEX> study (FOS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] spanning
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, can provide insights into the evolution of
        the risk factors and their partial and/or joint effects on
        chronic conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>.
        There is a growing interest among policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> in
        identifying preventive strategies for tackling chronic
        conditions. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Health Initiative</ENAMEX> is
        an ongoing longitudinal study in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for investigating the risk factors of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . Detailed analyses of existing longitudinal data sets
        can provide useful insights into the effects of factors
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, physical activity, and alcohol consumption
        on the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>. Because these
        conditions develop gradually over time, it is important to
        analyze their effects on intermediate risk factors such as
        blood pressure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>. Application of
        longitudinal econometric models incorporating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-dependence between the multiple risk factors can
        provide further insights.
        The purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to analyze <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> time
        observations available on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the FOS
        and develop empirical models for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' weight, HDL
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and systolic and diastolic blood
        pressure that are potential risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>. Models were also developed for the probability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20-year</TIMEX> period. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> analysis of the multiple risk factors in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX> using alternative statistical techniques can facilitate
        an assessment of the likely effects of behavioral
        modifications for reducing the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study sample
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1971</TIMEX>, a cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framingham Heart</ENAMEX> study were recruited for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX> ]
          . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were examined at the baseline (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exam 1</ENAMEX>) and
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exams 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> that took place, respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Exam 1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>, and
          survival status was again assessed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exam</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Variables measured longitudinally in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exams 1-4</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham Offspring</ENAMEX> public-use files
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' age, sex, alcohol intake, and the number
          of cigarettes smoked per day were investigated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Exams</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic blood pressure was measured
          in the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had been sitting still
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 5 minutes</TIMEX>. Height was measured in inches in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exams 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and weight was measured in pounds in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          exams using a standard beam balance. The surveys
          investigated physical activity patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exams 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          An index of physical activity was constructed on the
          basis of the reported <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> per day of sedentary, slight,
          moderate and heavy activities. An index of alcohol
          consumption was constructed using the reported intakes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and other alcoholic beverages.
          In each exam, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was drawn after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-hour</TIMEX> fast for
          determination of plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>; non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> was defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> greater than 140
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg per deciliter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were taking
          prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> was measured
          after precipitation of the plasma with heparin-manganese.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> was determined according the techniques
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipid Research Clinic Program</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . A CHD
          event was defined as the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina pectoris</ENAMEX>,
          myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, or
          coronary death.
        
        
          The analytical framework
          The risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events such as
          weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, and blood pressure respond gradually
          over time to dietary intakes, life-style, smoking, etc.
          Of these, changes in body weight resulting from energy
          imbalance are apparent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> themselves. While
          the nutrient composition of the diet was not measured in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX>, one would expect body weight to be a predictor
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> because fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intakes</ENAMEX> have increased in the
          observation period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size is a
          predictor of energy needs. Thus, one would expect height
          and weight to be predictors of nutrient intakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, and
          other risk factors. Because height is a good
          approximation for skeletal size, height is an important
          predictor of weight [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] ; height also reflects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> that is influenced by
          socioeconomic factors.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for the risk factors, it may be
          inappropriate to combine height and weight as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . From the standpoint of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events, it may be more
          risky for shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to gain weight than for
          taller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> because coronary artery diameter is
          likely to be higher in taller subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . By
          contrast, the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> may be less dependent on
          height; persisting energy imbalances may lead to similar
          outcomes in terms of the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          resistance. It is therefore desirable to include height
          and weight in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">empirical models</ENAMEX> and test the null
          hypothesis that these variables can be combined as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          Because specification of empirical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is limited
          by data availability, it was necessary to make
          simplifying assumptions in analyzing the risk factors.
          The empirical model for the data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX> is outlined
          in the Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' age, sex, and height were
          fixed characteristics. However, due to a paucity of
          socioeconomic variables such as education and income, the
          box containing the background characteristics also
          included the number of cigarettes smoked, alcohol intake,
          and physical activity. Because weight changes can
          influence risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n subjects</ENAMEX> was first explained
          by a dynamic formulation allowing the current weight to
          depend on previous measurement (i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,...</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n; t</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,4</NUMEX>):

          Here, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ln</ENAMEX> represents natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">logarithm</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX>' weight, age, and height were transformed into
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">logarithms</ENAMEX>, partly to reduce heteroscedasticity [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . The coefficients of the explanatory variables in
          logarithms were thus the "elasticities" (percentage
          change in the dependent variable resulting from a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          change in the independent variables). Because the model
          in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) was dynamic, the long run impact of an
          explanatory variable on weight was the estimated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) divided by (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-a 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ). Indicator variables for the
          observations from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exams 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were included in the
          model to allow different time means in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          examinations. The u 
          1it in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) were random error
          terms that could be decomposed in a random effects
          fashion as:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          1it = δ 
          i + v 
          1it 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 
          where, δ 
          i were subject specific random effects
          that were assumed to be normally distributed with zero
          mean and a constant variance, and v 
          1it were normally distributed error
          terms with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> mean and constant variance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          The models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and systolic
          and diastolic blood pressure were also dynamic and, in
          addition to the explanatory variables in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>),
          contained weight as an explanatory variable. For example,
          the dynamic random effects model for HDL could be written
          as (i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,...</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n; t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,4</NUMEX>):

          The error term u

          effects structure as in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). Moreover, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> effects affecting u 
          2it could be correlated with those
          influencing weight. Such problems can be addressed using

          outlined in the next section.

          Here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">variables Diabetes</ENAMEX> or CHD were latent
          variables assuming values 0 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> depending on if the
          subject reported to have had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> event,
          respectively. Explanatory variables in equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) and
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) were the measurements taken at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exam 1</ENAMEX>. The analyses
          were also done separately for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and the null
          hypothesis of constancy of the model parameters in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was tested using likelihood ratio tests. The
          estimation methods assumed the errors u 
          3i and u 
          4i to be drawings from a logistic
          distribution or from a normal distribution for the probit
          models. For probit analysis using current levels of
          explanatory variable in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> time periods, random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">effects</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated under the assumptions that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          3i and u 
          4i were normally distributed with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> effects structure as in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          proportional hazard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age</TIMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first CHD</ENAMEX> event.
        
        
          Statistical methods
          Because only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> time observations were available,
          estimation of the dynamic models given in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          was based on the assumptions that the number of subjects
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>) was large but the number of time periods was fixed.
          Thus, initial observations on the dependent variables
          (e.g. WT 
          i1 in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)) were treated as
          "endogenous" variables (correlated with the errors, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          ] ). The errors on equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) were assumed independent
          across subjects but correlated over time with a positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">definite variance-covariance matrix.</ENAMEX> The random effects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decomposition</ENAMEX> in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) was a special case of this
          formulation.
          The joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> observations in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamic</ENAMEX> models for weight (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, and systolic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure) implied that econometric
          techniques for estimating simultaneous equations models
          were useful. Details of the maximum likelihood estimation
          method are presented in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The profile
          log-likelihood functions were optimized using a numerical
          scheme E04 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JBF</ENAMEX> from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ; asymptotic standard errors
          of the parameters were obtained by approximating second
          derivatives of the function at the maximum. Possible
          correlation between the random effects δ 
          i and the mean over time of the
          subject's body weight was tested using a likelihood ratio
          statistic that was distributed, for large n, as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> variable with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 degrees</NUMEX> of freedom. The
          restrictions for combining height and weight as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), for example, were:
          b 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> + 2b 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) 
          These were tested by a likelihood ratio test that was
          distributed for large n as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> variable with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          degree of freedom.
          For the descriptive statistics, the package <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          ] was used. Binary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">logistic models</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and CHD
          events were estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS; Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazard
          models were also estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Probit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
          estimated using the packages <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIMDEP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>

        Results
        
          Descriptive statistics
          The sample means and standard deviations of selected
          variables from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exams in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX> are presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' average age was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. There was an increase in the body weight over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. This was also true for systolic blood pressure and
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1also</ENAMEX> reports the mean number
          of cigarettes smoked per day calculated for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>;
          there was a decline over time in the cigarettes smoked.
          For the subjects that were diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the
          mean age at the time of the diagnosis was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52 years</TIMEX>; the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first CHD</ENAMEX> event was diagnosed at the average age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Results from estimating dynamic random effects
          models for body weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, and systolic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2presents</ENAMEX> the maximum likelihood estimates of
          dynamic random effects models for weight, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and LDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>; the results for diastolic and systolic blood
          pressure are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In all cases, the
          dependent variables were transformed into natural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">logarithms</ENAMEX>; the independent variables age, height, and
          weight were also transformed into logarithms.
        
        
          Body weight
          The results for body weight in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2showed</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were significantly heavier than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Both age and age-squared were significant
          predictors of weight thereby showing an increase in
          weight with age, though at a declining rate. From the
          estimated parameters, the turning point of weight with
          respect to age occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 38 years</TIMEX>.
          However, this estimate was subject to considerable
          estimation error and may have also been influenced by
          attrition in the sample.
          The coefficient of physical activity score was
          negative but was not statistically significant. This
          could be because physical activity was measured only in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exams 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> index was positively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with weight, whereas cigarettes smoked were
          negatively associated; both these coefficients were
          statistically significant at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> level. Height was a
          significant predictor of weight, though the coefficient
          estimate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.796</NUMEX> was significantly lower than the value <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>;
          the data did not indicate a preference for modeling the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Coefficient of the lagged dependent variable was
          estimated to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 0.5</TIMEX> and was significant.
          Thus, the long run effects of an independent variable on
          weight were twice the magnitude of the corresponding
          short run coefficients in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>(i.e. the coefficients
          divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- the coefficient of the lagged dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variable</ENAMEX>). Coefficients of the indicator variables for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exams 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were positive and statistically
          significant.
        
        
          HDL cholesterol
          The results for HDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> are in the third
          column of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> had significant lower
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. There was an increase
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> with age though at a declining rate. The physical
          activity score and alcohol index were significant
          predictors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> with positive coefficients; the number
          of cigarettes smoked was negatively associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>.
          The coefficient of height was positive and that of weight
          was negative in the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>. However, the
          likelihood ratio test for combining height and weight as
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> rejected the restrictions in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>). This
          may have been partly due to the relatively large samples
          used in the estimation. The likelihood ratio test for
          exogeneity of the mean over time of body weight in the
          model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> also rejected the null hypothesis. Thus,
          the factors affecting body weight appeared to be
          correlated with the unobserved random effects affecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>. The results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2took</ENAMEX> account of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlations</ENAMEX> in the estimation.
        
        
          LDL cholesterol
          The results for LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> reported in the last
          column of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2were</ENAMEX> based on the observations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Exams</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2 and 3</TIMEX>; only the indicator variable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exam 3</ENAMEX> was
          included in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Sex differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> were not
          statistically significant. The relationship between age
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> was again a quadratic one though the turning
          point occurred at age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6.8 years</TIMEX> indicating that, for the
          age range in the sample, there was a steady increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> with time. Both the physical activity score and the
          index of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> were insignificant predictors of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>. However, the number of cigarettes smoked was
          positively associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>. Height was negatively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> whereas weight was positively associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>. Although the likelihood ratio test again rejected
          the combination of height and weight as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, one can
          broadly interpret the results as implying that subjects
          with higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> had lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and higher LDL
          concentrations. Coefficient of the lagged dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> was statistically significant and was smaller
          than in the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> presumably due to greater
          changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> in response to the dietary factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic blood pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3presents</ENAMEX> the maximum likelihood estimates of
          the dynamic random effects models for the systolic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure. There were no significant sex
          differences in the results from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models. The
          quadratic terms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> were significant in both models
          though with opposite signs. The coefficients of age
          variables implied that systolic blood pressure declined
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of approximately 18 years</TIMEX> and thereafter
          increased. By contrast, diastolic blood pressure
          increased until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age 51 years</TIMEX> and then showed a
          decline. These non-linear estimates were indicative of
          the complex time profiles of blood pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Results from binary logistic and probit regressions
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20-year</TIMEX> period
          The results from estimating binary logistic and probit
          models for whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> during the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year period</TIMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. To circumvent the problems
          due to censoring, the risk factors included were the
          measurements taken at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exam 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4also</ENAMEX> reports the
          confidence intervals for the odds ratio using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> estimates from the logistic regression, and
          "marginal effects" estimated from the probit model.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> statistics for combining height and weight as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> are also reported.
          The results for the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> using logistic
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probit models</ENAMEX> were consistent across the respective
          models. The coefficients of sex, physical activity score,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> index, systolic blood pressure, and LDL
          concentrations were not statistically different from
          zero. However, cigarette smoked, diastolic blood
          pressure, and weight were significantly positively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>
          and height were negatively associated. The likelihood
          ratio statistic accepted the null hypothesis that height
          and weight could be combined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Thus, for
          example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exam 1</ENAMEX> increased
          the chances of getting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 8%-15%</NUMEX> in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> period.
        
        
          Results from binary logistic and probit regressions
          for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> event in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20-year</TIMEX> period
          The results from the binary logistic and probit
          regressions for CHD events during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20-year period</TIMEX> are
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 43%-75%</NUMEX> lower
          chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events. Coefficients of physical activity,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> index, and systolic blood pressure were not
          statistically different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. However,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> concentrations, cigarettes smoked, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure were significant predictors of
          CHD events.
          Height and weight were not significant predictors of
          CHD events, though the P-value of the coefficient of
          height was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.053</NUMEX>. When height and weight were combined as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, the likelihood ratio test rejected the restrictions
          implied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> transformation in the logistic
          regression, and the coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was not
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. When weight was
          dropped from the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>, height was significantly
          negatively associated with the probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> in both
          the logistic and the probit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. By contrast, when
          height was dropped from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, weight was not a
          significant predictor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>. These results indicated
          that diameter of coronary arteries was likely to be
          influenced by height and hence taller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had lower
          chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events. By contrast, the significance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> showed that, irrespective
          of height, being over-weight increased the chances of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
          The coefficient of the variable for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> was
          positive and was a statistically significant predictor of
          CHD events; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exam 1</ENAMEX> had between
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%-534%</NUMEX> higher chances of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> event. Lastly, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> effects probit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events using current values of the explanatory
          variables in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exams. Including the random effects,
          however, often led to boundary solutions using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> in the software packages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . These
          results could be due to the serial correlation in the
          errors affecting longitudinal probit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Moreover,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated for the age
          at which the subjects <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> event using the
          explanatory variables measured at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exam 1</ENAMEX>. The predictive
          power of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> was poor in comparison with the
          results for the binary logistic and probit models
          indicating the uncertainties in predicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' ages
          at the time of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CHD</ENAMEX> event.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This paper analyzed the effects of risk factors such as
        smoking, weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, and blood pressure for the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic condition diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events
        using data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX>. Because of the gradual evolution
        of the risk factors, dynamic random effects <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were
        used to explain the risk factors by age, physical activity,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption, and cigarettes smoked. An advantage of
        the present approach was that one can discuss pathways
        through which the multiple risk factors affected the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> outcomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ; alternative approaches
        are available in the statistical literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        While the inter-relationships between behavioral and
        biological factors are complex, the present analysis
        enables the estimation of the combined effects of the risk
        factors on CHD events under certain assumptions. The model
        represented by equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) was "triangular" and
        in the calculations reported below, we ignored the
        endogeneity of weight and potentially small bias in the
        estimate of the coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in the model for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>. The total effect of an explanatory variable on CHD
        events was thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, plus
        the coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.195</NUMEX> in the logistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>)
        multiplied by the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> of the explanatory
        variable in the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        First, after controlling for sex, age, physical
        activity, smoking, blood pressure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> and HDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, alcohol intake was not significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4and 5</ENAMEX>, respectively. This is in contrast with
        the beneficial effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . An important aspect in the analyzing the
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake is the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> consumed
        and if they were consumed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake data in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOS</ENAMEX> cannot make such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinctions</ENAMEX>, it was perhaps reasonable to expect that the
        analysis would not provide unambiguous evidence on this
        issue. Further, in the dynamic random effects models,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> was positively associated with body weight,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> predicted lower chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events.
        Thus, the analysis of the multiple risk factors in the FOS
        indicated an overall tendency of the beneficial and harmful
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake to cancel out.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> was seen to be an important risk factor for
        CHD events. The average LDL concentration at the first
        examination was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ dL. A decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> mg, for example, would constitute a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>
        decline. Using the estimated parameters from the logistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>), the effect of this decrease would be
        to lower the chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 14%-39%</NUMEX>.
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> was not significant in the model for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
        there were no additional effects of lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>. By
        contrast, an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL in HDL concentration
        would constitute an approximate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> increase and predict a
        decline in CHD events by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%-45%</NUMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> was
        negatively associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, this decrease in HDL
        would further lower chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%-5%</NUMEX>. These
        results also show the importance of disaggregating serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> categories for the
        analysis of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the effects of smoking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> cigarettes per day at
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> examination would imply a likely increase in CHD
        events <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 11%-32%</NUMEX>; this effect would increase to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 12%-33%</NUMEX> by taking into account the effects of
        smoking on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Using the estimates from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>,
        halving the average number of cigarettes smoked would
        reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 6%-16%</NUMEX>. Lastly, the effects of
        body weight on CHD events in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> appeared to
        operate through the decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Using the results
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> decrease in average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Exam 1 to 22</TIMEX>
        was likely to reduce the number of subjects with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 350 to 110</NUMEX>. Because diabetic subjects
        had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately a 3</NUMEX>-fold greater chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was likely to lead to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        decline in CHD events. Overall, the results from FOS
        indicated that the importance of reducing weight, LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and blood pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and increasing HDL
        for reducing the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> The econometric modeling of the risk factors
        indicated that it is better to rely on joint rather than
        the partial effects of risk factors in part because the
        time sequence of chronic diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and CHD
        is known. The importance of modeling multiple risk factors
        for various diseases has also been emphasized in recent
        studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
