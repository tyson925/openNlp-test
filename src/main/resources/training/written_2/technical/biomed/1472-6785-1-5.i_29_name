        Early recognition of the contrast between the
        stabilizing influences of density-dependent population
        regulation, and potentially de-stabilizing influences of
        environmental variation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , laid a foundation for
        theoretical modeling of population stability in stochastic
        environments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] that assumes renewed relevance in light
        of current developments in ecology and climate research [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . Recently, for instance, numerous studies have
        documented the influences of global-scale climatic
        variation on the population dynamics of vertebrates in
        widely diverse ecosystems (see, e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] for reviews),
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species interactions</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . To our knowledge, however, no study has yet
        documented a simultaneous and direct influence of
        large-scale climate on the dynamics at all trophic levels
        in a single system. Such a pervasive influence could pose
        consequences for the persistence of biological communities
        if the climatic influence at any trophic level (or multiple
        levels) were strong enough to alter its dynamical stability
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Here, we use empirical data on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-trophic level
        system involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>, herbivores, and vegetation, and
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-level model, to test for the influences of
        climate on the dynamics at and among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> trophic
        levels, while simultaneously accounting for the roles of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intrinsic</ENAMEX> (density-dependent) and interspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Previously, we identified correlations
        between large-scale variation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Oscillation</ENAMEX> (NAO) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and: predation
        efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wolves</ENAMEX> ( 
        Canis lupus ), mortality of old moose
        ( 
        Alces alces ), and growth dynamics of
        balsam fir ( 
        Abies balsamea ) on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . Additionally, we have documented influences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAO</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX> predation, and density dependence on the intrinsic
        rate of increase in the moose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Hence, the current analysis was motivated by the
        results of these earlier attempts to dissect the relative
        contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic processes to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, as well as by a more general
        interest in developing a community-level model of climatic
        effects at and among multiple trophic levels that may
        subsequently contribute to our understanding of the
        implications of climatic change for community stability.
        Quantifying the role of climatic variation in the dynamics
        at multiple trophic levels requires, however, a modeling
        framework that first accounts for the influence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interspecific</ENAMEX> and intrinsic processes on the dynamical
        structure at each level, so that the influence of intrinsic
        processes on the autoregressive (AR) structure of the time
        series data is not mistaken for a lagged influence of
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stochasticity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Based on the approach used in the development of
        previous bivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] , we
        developed and applied a model testing for the direct
        influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics at
        individual trophic levels and interactions among levels
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This graphical model was used to express
        mathematically the predicted autoregressive structure of
        the time series data at each level on the basis of
        interspecific density interactions at adjacent trophic
        levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , as well as the time lags at which climate
        might influence dynamics at each level (see equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4</ENAMEX>)
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>, below). The time series we analyzed comprise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of data (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958-88</TIMEX>) from the monitoring study on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle</ENAMEX>
        Royale on the population dynamics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wolves</ENAMEX> and moose, and
        interannual variability in growth increments of balsam fir
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 15 16</ENAMEX> ] . Though the data extend to the present,
        estimates of moose density beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> have not been
        adjusted by cohort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ref.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ), so we
        constrained our analysis to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        The corrected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akaike Information Criterion</ENAMEX> (AIC 
        
          c 
         ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] scores of the pure time series data at each
        level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> indicate that the AR
        dimension of the data for the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958-88</TIMEX> is one for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolves</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for moose, and one for fir. AIC

        and for balsam <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fir -26.0, -22.1, -21.6.</ENAMEX> The lowest AIC 
        
          c 
         score indicates the most parsimonious dimension at
        each trophic level.
        In full agreement with the pure AR structure of the time
        series, the most parsimonious ecological model of wolf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> was an AR(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) model with current-year climate as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1a</ENAMEX>); the best model of moose dynamics was
        an AR(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) model with current-year climate as a covariate
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1b</ENAMEX>); and the best model of fir dynamics was an AR(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        model with current-year climate as a covariate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1c</ENAMEX>).
        Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> provided a good approximation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> at the individual trophic levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Note, however, that for moose a good approximation of
        the dynamics was afforded by an AR(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) model with the same
        covariates as the best AR(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) model in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>( 
        R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>, AIC 
        
          c 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= -63.9</ENAMEX>), and so might be favored over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) model
        on the basis of parsimony.
        Direct density dependence was slightly stronger at the
        middle trophic level (moose) than at the top or bottom
        levels, though none of the tests for differences between
        these coefficients was significant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In contrast,
        the influence of large-scale climate was significantly
        weaker at the middle trophic level than at either the top
        or bottom trophic levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of our analysis corroborate previous
        observations of the limiting influences of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate
        in moose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> dynamics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , of the mediating
        influence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate in wolf-moose interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] , of the roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wolf predation</ENAMEX> and density dependence
        in moose dynamics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 20</NUMEX> ] , and of the direct influence
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate on growth dynamics of balsam fir [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isle Royale</ENAMEX>. To our knowledge, however, this study
        constitutes the first documentation of direct and
        simultaneous influences of large-scale climate on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> at multiple trophic levels in a single system.
        Although many studies have documented influences of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">winter</ENAMEX> weather, particularly snow conditions, on wolf-prey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] , we are unaware of
        studies showing an influence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate on wolf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population dynamics</ENAMEX>. Evidence of influences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> on wolf
        movement, social tendencies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and predation rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] suggests, however, that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> climate might affect wolf
        survival. While we wish to avoid speculating as to
        potential mechanisms underlying the direct influence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAO</ENAMEX> on wolf dynamics indicated by our analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
        it may be worth considering that residual variation in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> wolf mortality, after accounting for the influences
        of wolf density and pack size [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , correlates negatively
        with the current-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAO</ENAMEX> index (standardized 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.52</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.22</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.038</NUMEX>).
        Trophic theory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ecology</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] ,
        and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>) predict
        that the embedding dimension (i.e., the number of time lags
        we must look back upon in order to find a correlation with
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current year</TIMEX>'s density) of the dynamics at each trophic
        level should reflect the number of species influencing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> at each level, as several recent analyses have
        also demonstrated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 28 29</NUMEX> ] . In this perspective, we
        found, however, lower dimension (i.e., first-order) at both
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> and vegetation levels than expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
        while dynamics at the herbivore level displayed the higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimension</ENAMEX> predicted by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimensionality</ENAMEX> in this large-mammal system parallels the
        dynamic structure of the lynx-hare system of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
        boreal forest at the herbivore level, but not at the
        predator level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The embedding dimension of lynx,
        which are affected by many species other than snowshoe hare
        across the boreal forest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, is generally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
        higher [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 30</NUMEX> ] . The contrasting simplicity of wolf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> reflects, we suggest, the
        comparatively insular nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> system and
        relative scarcity of additional species influencing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wolves</ENAMEX> there [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite having low dimension, the top and bottom trophic
        levels displayed complex dynamics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Indeed,
        spectral analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX> and moose time series reveals
        significant periodicity at both levels that is apparently
        driven by phase-dependent predation, a process that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> to wolf dynamics but exogenous to moose (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C. Stenseth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.O. Peterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.A. Vucetich, A.M.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX>, in review). Fir dynamics on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle Royale</ENAMEX> are,
        moreover, tightly linked with changes in moose density [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] , which could contribute to exogenously generated
        periodicity at that level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        The low dimension of the dynamics at the top and bottom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophic</ENAMEX> levels masks, in a sense, interactions with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjacent</ENAMEX> (herbivore) level that were captured in these
        models. Note, however, that in the most parsimonious model
        of wolf dynamics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the lag-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> autoregressive term
        quantifying direct density dependence includes the
        coefficient of self-regulation in moose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
        b 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ), and the coefficient of the lag-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>
        pack size term includes the coefficient quantifying the
        interaction between moose density and wolf density
        (coefficient 
        a 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Equation 2a</ENAMEX>). As well, in the
        most parsimonious model of fir dynamics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the
        lag-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> autoregressive term includes the coefficients
        quantifying the influences of moose on fir (coefficient 
        c 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2c</NUMEX>) and of fir on moose
        (coefficient b 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> from equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2b</NUMEX>). Hence, an important
        conclusion of this analysis is that while interactions
        between adjacent trophic levels lead to predictions of
        higher-order dynamics during the derivation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> model (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the act of following the
        coefficients from the individual trophic-level models ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensu</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ) allows us to observe
        that trophic interactions may also appear in first-order
        density dependence.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Experimental evidence from microcosm studies indicates
        that climatic change may alter community stability if
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> composing the community exhibit weak
        density dependence, or if climate change influences
        interspecific interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . While we caution
        against drawing general conclusions from this analysis, our
        results suggest that climatic change has the potential to
        influence the stability of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> by altering the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> and stability at any single, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>, of the
        individual trophic levels. Because self-regulation (i.e.,
        direct density dependence) was relatively weaker at the top
        and bottom trophic levels (though not significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistically</ENAMEX>), it may be these levels at which climate
        change alters stability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. It is worth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recalling</ENAMEX>, however, that theory predicts that population
        stability depends on the relative strengths of intrinsic
        and environmental influences on population dynamics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In this regard, it may be the observation that climate
        exerted its greatest influence on the dynamics of the top
        and bottom trophic levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) that is most relevant
        because, even if self regulation were equivalent at all
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> levels, it is at the levels most responsive to
        climate where we will see the greatest effects of climate
        change on dynamics and stability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Moreover, it appears that in this system, the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophic</ENAMEX> levels with the simplest dynamics (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vegetation</ENAMEX>) also displayed the greatest response to
        climate. Whether community stability in a changing climate
        relates to dynamic complexity at individual trophic levels,
        as opposed to complexity of entire food webs ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensu</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ), should prove to be a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fruitful</ENAMEX> and important pursuit in future research.
