        In terms of avoiding bias, the most rigorous method for
        evaluating a medical intervention is the randomized
        controlled trial. However, many clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are
        unable to conduct a randomized trial because of excessive
        cost or required effort or difficulty overcoming strongly
        held beliefs among health care providers or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In
        these situations, a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> may consider a
        design and analysis based on observational data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> common method of inference from observational data
        is the cohort study with an adjustment for risk factors
        using, for example, regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and propensity
        scores [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In some situations, estimates from
        high-quality cohort studies have been similar to those from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> trials [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . However there
        are some notable exceptions, including studies of the
        effect of beta-carotene on cardiovascular mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] , the effect of hormone therapy on the rate of
        cardiovascular disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , the effect of epidural
        analgesia on the probability of Cesarean section [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ,
        the effect of beta-blockers on mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and the
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> on the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Some of the discrepancy between the results of these high
        quality cohort studies and randomized trials may be
        explained by differences in the intervention, patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, or duration of follow-up. Nevertheless, a major
        reason for bias with cohort studies is the failure to
        adjust for 
        all factors related the receipt of
        intervention and outcome. This failure may be due to the
        inability to identify or collect the necessary data, or the
        difficulty measuring or quantifying subjective factors such
        as clinical judgment. For a fuller discussion of how an
        omitted factor related to receipt of intervention and
        outcome can bias results in a cohort study but not a
        randomized trial see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kramer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        An alternative and less widely known approach is the
        paired availability design for historical controls [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . As we describe in more detail, the paired
        availability design consists of comparing outcomes in
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> before versus after a
        change in availability of a medical intervention. To adjust
        for different changes in availability among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, the test statistic for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is the difference in outcome before and
        after the change in availability divided by the change in
        the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who receive the intervention.
        These test statistics are combined in a meta-analysis,
        which weights the statistic from each hospital according to
        the reciprocal of the variance, a quantity that depends on
        sample size and the change in availability.
        The paired availability design avoids many of the biases
        of analyses based on traditional historical controls. With
        traditional historical controls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> compare
        outcome among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who receive a new intervention with
        outcome among a previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who received the
        standard intervention. Selection bias often arises because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who receive the new intervention are typically not
        comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who received the standard
        intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The paired availability design
        reduces selection bias because the comparison is between 
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (those who received the
        intervention and those who did not) before the change in
        availability and 
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (those who received the
        intervention and those who did not) after the change in
        availability. Thus the intervention is the availability of
        treatment, instead of the receipt of treatment. If the
        sample of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> eligible for intervention is
        comparable before and after the change in availability, one
        can obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of a change
        in availability by comparing outcome among all subjects
        before the change in availability with the outcome among
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> after the change in availability. This is
        analogous to obtaining an unbiased estimate of the effect
        of intent-to-treat by comparing outcomes among all subjects
        in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of a randomized trial subject to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncompliance</ENAMEX>.
        For both the paired availability design and randomized
        trials subject to noncompliance, the ideal goal is an
        unbiased estimate of the effect of receipt of treatment. If
        certain requirements hold, which we discuss, a simple
        adjustment gives an unbiased estimate of the effect of
        receipt of treatment in the paired availability design.
        Similarly, in certain situations involving randomized
        trials with noncompliance, such as switching interventions
        immediately after randomization, a similar adjustment also
        yields an unbiased estimate of the effect of receipt of
        treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> interested in a formal
        mathematical statement of these requirements and how they
        give rise to the simple estimate should consult references
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Design
          The paired availability design uses data collected in
          either a prospective or retrospective manner, or a
          combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Although implementing a
          multi-center study may initially appear burdensome, two
          mitigating factors lessen the burden: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) randomization
          is not required and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> need not collect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on risk factors if the requirements hold. The
          requirements (to follow) are most likely to hold when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> period for the entire study is not too long. We
          recommend limiting the total study duration to not more
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, recognizing there may be exceptions due
          to patient accrual rate, intervention, and outcome. If
          availability changes gradually, it is often sufficient to
          split the data halfway between the start of the "before"
          period and the end of the "after" period; although more
          sophisticated statistical techniques can be employed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          ]
          The change in availability between the "before" and
          "after" periods can take different forms which do not
          affect the design or analysis. With fixed availability,
          the intervention is available to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who arrive
          during a certain time of day or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day of the week</TIMEX>. With
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> availability, the intervention is available only
          if the necessary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> or equipment is available,
          which occurs at random. In either case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> can
          decide whether or not to undergo the intervention.
          The study design has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> requirements for making
          appropriate inference: stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, stable
          treatment, stable evaluation, stable preference, and no
          effect of availability on the effect of intervention
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, treatment, and evaluation,
          are required for appropriate inference in any medical
          study involving comparisons over time. Stable preference
          and no effect of availability on the effect of
          intervention, are needed to adjust for differences in
          availability among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
          The first requirement, stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, is that the
          composition of subjects eligible for the intervention
          should not change from the "before" to the "after" period
          in ways that would affect outcome. This requirement would
          be violated if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> seek treatment because of the
          availability of the treatment under study. The assumption
          is therefore violated if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> advertise the
          availability of a new diagnostic test or medical
          intervention. In addition, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> should serve a well-defined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with little
          in- or out- migration. Examples include the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          in a geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> or a military medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> could
          introduce bias if the new intervention were available in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> hospital and it were not possible to exclude
          from the analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who switched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to
          undergo the new intervention. The stable population
          requirement would also be violated by changes in
          eligibility criteria over time. If eligibility is
          determined by a medical diagnosis, the method of
          diagnosis must not change over time. Lastly the stable
          population requirement would be violated if the
          underlying prognosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> changed over time. For
          example in a study of treatment for a viral infection
          which is spreading through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the most
          susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> would likely enter the trial <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
          which would violate the stable population requirement if
          they have the worse prognosis after infection.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> requirement, stable treatment, is that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient management</ENAMEX> unrelated to the intervention is
          identical in the "before" and "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Thus, in
          studying the effect of epidural analgesia on the
          probability of Caesarian section, other forms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obstetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should be constant over time.
          Similarly, in studying the effect of an intense
          chemotherapeutic regimen for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> on survival, the type
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> should not change of over time, as new and
          more effective antibiotics could lower treatment-related
          mortality irrespective of the efficacy of the anticancer
          regimen.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> requirement, stable evaluation, is that the
          method of evaluation is identical in the "before" and
          "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For example, the use of a new radiologic
          test to stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> may
          artifactually improve prognosis of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>,
          independent of the therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          Because the paired availability design involves
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, random violations
          of the stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, treatment, and evaluation
          requirements will tend to average out, and not affect the
          conclusion. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is with systematic
          violations. To minimize systematic violations, if
          possible, a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical centers
          should be studied.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> requirement, stable preference, is
          strengthened in the absence of new information in the
          "after" period that would change a subject's preference
          for the medical intervention. This requirement could be
          violated by a widely publicized report of a harmful side
          effect of the new treatment, or direct-to-consumer
          advertising of the intervention to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. To the best
          of our knowledge, in the paired availability design to
          study the effect of epidural analgesia on the probability
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cesarean</ENAMEX> section, there were no credible reports of
          either detrimental or beneficial side effects to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> from epidural analgesia and no relevant
          direct-to-consumer advertising. In contrast, if the media
          reported preliminary results that radioactive seed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implants</ENAMEX> had fewer side effects than previous approaches
          for treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>, healthier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who care
          most about the side effects may be more likely to request
          the new therapy than less healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who only care
          if treatment reduces the risk of mortality.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> requirement is that the effect of the
          intervention on outcome does not change with a change in
          availability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, it applies only when there are
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the "before" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who undergo the
          intervention. Mathematically the following two
          assumptions are required to estimate method effectiveness
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Subjects in the "before" group
          who undergo intervention have comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in
          the "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who undergo intervention (which is
          justified by the other requirements) 
          and the effect of intervention is
          the same in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, i.e. it does not depend on a
          change in availability. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Subjects in the "after" group
          who do 
          not undergo the intervention have
          comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in the "before" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who do 
          not undergo the intervention (as
          justified by the other requirements) 
          and the effect of no intervention
          is the same in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. By definition no intervention
          is the same in the "before" and "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, so a
          change in availability of intervention would have no
          bearing on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). Thus the effect of a change in
          availability on the effect of the intervention only
          pertains to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the "before" group
          undergo intervention.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> requirement would be violated if increased
          availability caused some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> to undergo the
          intervention sooner in the course of the disease,
          changing prognosis. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> requirement would also be
          violated if there were a learning curve with new
          intervention, such as a surgical technique that improves
          with the number of procedures. If such violations are
          likely, the design should be restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> where no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the "before" group
          received the intervention.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindeman</ENAMEX> provided a formula to calculate the
          required the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> to
          achieve sufficient power for hypothesis testing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          However, the formula may be difficult to use if the
          required information on the likely variability of an
          effect over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> is not readily
          available. In such situations, as a rule of thumb, we
          recommend a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> preferable, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ideal.
        
        
          Analysis
          The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the effect
          of the receipt of the medical intervention, which is also
          called method-effectiveness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . As derived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baker</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindeman</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , if the aforementioned
          requirements hold, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>,
          the estimated effect of receipt of treatment is
          D/F, where
          D= difference in outcome before and after change in
          availability
          F = fraction that received intervention 
          after change in availability -
          fraction that received intervention 
          before change in availability
          If the outcome measure is a continuous variable such
          as blood measure, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is a difference in the average
          outcomes between the "before" and "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. If the
          outcome measure is binary, such as success or failure, D
          is a difference in the fraction who fail or succeed in
          the "before" and "after" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          The above estimate, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/F, has an analog in the analysis
          of randomized trials when some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> switch treatments
          soon after randomization. With an intent-to-treat
          analysis, one can estimate use-effectiveness, D*, which
          is the effect of random assignment of treatment on
          outcome. Similarly, one can estimate F*, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          subjects in the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that received the new
          treatment minus the fraction of subjects in the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that received the new treatment. Invoking an
          assumption analogous to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> requirement for the
          paired availability design, the estimated
          method-effectiveness is D*/F* [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          As illustrated in the calculations accompanying Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, we use a standard approach for a random effects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] to summarize the estimated effect of
          receipt of treatment over all studies. The summary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> is a weighted average of the estimated effect
          of receipt of treatment for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, where the weight for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> is the reciprocal of the sum of the sampling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> and the variance of the true effect over the
          studies. The sampling variance of the estimated effect of
          receipt of treatment, the variability due to taking a
          sample from a hypothetical larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equals the sampling variance of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">numerator</ENAMEX>, which is a standard calculation, divided by
          denominator squared. The variability of the true effect,
          which arises because the medical intervention is not
          exactly identical among all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, is computed using
          the formula in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DerSimonian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laird</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The
          standard error of the summary statistic is the square
          root of the reciprocal of the sum of the weights. An
          approximate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval is computed as the
          summary statistic plus or minus the standard error
          multiplied by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 1/2</NUMEX> percentile of a t-distribution
          with degrees of freedom equal to the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
          or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> minus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This value can be
          found in tables in many statistics books; for example for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 degrees</NUMEX> of freedom and the
          value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.23</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Example
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lindeman</ENAMEX> applied the paired availability
          design to study the effect of epidural analgesia on the
          probability of Cesarean section [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . They identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> where epidural analgesia
          was introduced, expanded, or discontinued. Stable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and stable treatment requirements were
          supported by the reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. Stable
          evaluation held because of the unambiguous nature of the
          outcome. The stable preference requirement likely held,
          as there were no widely published reports concerning
          risks or benefits of epidural analgesia and no
          direct-to-consumer advertising of the procedure. Because
          increased availability would likely cause some subjects
          to receive epidural analgesia earlier in the course of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>, there was concern about violating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
          requirement of no effect of availability on the effect of
          intervention. However, because a randomized trial had
          previously shown that the effect of epidural analgesia on
          the probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cesarean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> did not differ
          whether epidural analgesia was initiated early or late in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>, the requirement was thought to hold. A slightly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simplified</ENAMEX> version of the data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindeman</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In particular, to simplify the
          calculations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> designated as number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, we
          regrouped data from multiple time periods into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> time
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>.
          Using the aforementioned method of analysis, with more
          details in the notes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, the estimated increase
          in the probability of Cesarean section due to epidural
          analgesia was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.005</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval of
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.047</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.037</NUMEX>). This is fairly close to the more exact
          calculations based on a permutation distribution in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, these results were similar to those from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis of randomized trials adjusted for switching
          of treatments that yielded an estimate of method
          effectiveness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval of
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.08</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, a high quality
          propensity score analysis of cohort data gave a much
          larger estimate of. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval of
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.07</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>). The bias may be due to the omission of a risk
          factor for intense pain early in labor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The paired availability design has promise for
        evaluating medical versus surgical interventions. For such
        an evaluation, it would be difficult to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
        a randomized trial because few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> want to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to those options. Also, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> feel
        uncomfortable assigning their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to invasive versus
        non-invasive interventions. Thus a validated alternative
        method of evaluation would be of considerable value. We
        think that, in some cases, the paired availability design
        would be well suited for this type of evaluation. The key
        to the stable population requirement is having clear and
        constant eligibility criteria. For stable treatment,
        ancillary care and the method of evaluation must be the
        same over time. For the stable preference assumption to
        hold, there should be no advertising of the medical
        intervention. For the requirement of no effect of
        availability on the effect of intervention, either the
        surgical technique should have stabilized or the design
        should only include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with no previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeries</ENAMEX>.
        A possible example would be an analysis of surgical
        removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver metastases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver metastatectomy</ENAMEX> has been associated
        with favorable outcomes, a more rigorous evaluation is
        needed. An analysis of prospective cohort data is likely to
        be biased because of the difficulty observing or
        quantifying important risk factors such as patient
        performance status, tumor doubling times, and meticulous
        staging.
        Several conditions listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2are</ENAMEX> favorable to a
        paired availability design. The surgical approach has been
        relatively stable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> scans and CEA
        blood testing in follow-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after resection of
        the primary tumor has been popular for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Although systemic therapy has changed, efficacy of
        chemotherapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX> has reached a plateau.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metastatectomy</ENAMEX> is not one of the procedures heavily
        advertised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. An ideal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circumstance</ENAMEX> would be to apply the paired availability
        design to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> before and after the arrival of a
        surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oncologist</ENAMEX> who brings the procedure into common
        practice for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time at that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
        A well-designed randomized study of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> metastatectomy
        would still give a more statistically valid assessment of
        the procedure than the paired availability design. However,
        such a randomized study has never been done, despite the
        use of metastatectomy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. A paired availability
        design would likely be subject to fewer biases than a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> study comparing outcomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did versus
        those who did not undergo the surgical procedure.
        To decide if a method for analyzing observational data
        is generally reliable, one should have experience comparing
        the results to those obtained from a randomized trial. In
        the only application of the paired availability design to
        date. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindeman</ENAMEX> obtained similar results from the
        paired availability design as from a meta-analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> trials. These results differed substantially
        from a multivariate adjustment for concurrent controls,
        which likely omitted an important risk factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. Hopefully
        this article will spur new studies using the paired
        availability design, including some comparing the results
        to those from randomized trials.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We wish to emphasize that the randomized trial
        represents the strongest form of evaluation and should be
        implemented if possible. However we recognize that there
        are situations where the randomized trial is difficult to
        implement, such as comparing medical versus surgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. If the requirements for the paired
        availability design are met, we recommend it as an
        alternative with advantages over the usual analyses from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies.
