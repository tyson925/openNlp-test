        Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a
        proinflammatory cytokine that may play a role in several
        disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crohn</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, allograft rejection, asthma and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> was initially described as released
        from activated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , subsequent investigations
        have localized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in a variety of other cells and tissues
        (for a recent review [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). For example, pre-formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> can be found in the epithelia of several organs and
        may be released in response to endotoxemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system remains to be
        determined, yet neurons in the brain synthesize and rapidly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">release MIF</ENAMEX> while glial cells appear to store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] ,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior pituitary gland</ENAMEX> contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> that may be
        released during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endotoxemia</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recent evidence from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> is
        located in the bladder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and also in peripheral
        ganglia innervating the bladder and other pelvic viscera.
        The urothelium contains a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of pre-formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA were also detected by
        Western blotting techniques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in the major pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ganglia</ENAMEX> (MPG) that provides efferent (parasympathetic and
        sympathetic) innervation to the bladder and other pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscera</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> dorsal root
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ganglia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>) that provide afferent innervation to the
        bladder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and other pelvic viscera constitutively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expressed MIF</ENAMEX>. Finally, the lumbosacral spinal cord of the
        rat where afferent and efferent information is integrated
        to result in effective pelvic viscera function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , was
        also shown to contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA.
        Acute bladder inflammation induced by local
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">intravesical</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">irritants</ENAMEX> or
        lipopolysaccharide altered the levels of this cytokine in
        the bladder suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may be implicated in the
        early stages of bladder inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition, there were changes in the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and
        cyclooxygenase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the central and peripheral nervous
        tissues that innervate the bladder and other pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscera</ENAMEX>. Therefore, in addition to the local inflammatory
        effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may also be involved in neurogenically mediated
        changes at both central and peripheral nervous system sites
        following visceral inflammation.
        Our previous studies reported the anatomical
        localization for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> only in the bladder, while the
        location of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the peripheral ganglia (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG; DRG</ENAMEX>) and in
        the lumbosacral spinal cord was not determined since the
        focus was on the change in MIF amounts in these tissues
        following bladder inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, as
        part of our ongoing investigations on the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in
        pelvic viscera inflammation, we investigated the location
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in two pelvic organs (bladder and prostate) and in
        peripheral ganglia that innervate these viscera using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX>. We examined the major pelvic ganglia,
        where the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons that
        innervate the bladder and the prostate are located. Also,
        we investigated the inferior mesenteric ganglia and the
        lumbar sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that provide sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> to the bladder and other pelvic viscera [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . We also determined the location of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX>
        dorsal root ganglia that provide afferent innervation to
        these organs. Finally, we localized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> within the
        lumbosacral spinal cord since the spinal cord integrates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferent</ENAMEX> and efferent information from the pelvic viscera [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the bladder and the prostate
          Intense MIF immunoreactivity in the urothelium was
          observed in the bladders of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
          confirming our previous observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The
          staining was most intense in the basal and intermediate
          layers of the urothelium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The superficial
          layer of the urothelium showed slight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining
          but also showed areas that appeared clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). In addition, the fibroblasts in the lamina
          propria, immediately under the urothelium also showed MIF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
          was also observed in the smooth muscle in the bladder,
          confirming our previous findings. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX> in smooth
          muscle fibers appeared to stain with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and weak,
          diffuse staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of
          smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>).
          In the prostate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining was observed in
          the acini (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 1D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,1F</ENAMEX>) with the majority of the MIF
          staining localized to acinar epithelial cells.
          Occasionally, proximal acini, following the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classification of Lee et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , could be observed
          in some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 1D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>). Proximal acini could be
          distinguished from peripheral and central acini by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuboidal</ENAMEX> (as opposed to columnar) epithelial cells and by
          the presence of surrounding smooth muscle layers. The MIF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the proximal acini was more intense than in
          the central acini where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining was limited to
          basal epithelial cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1F</ENAMEX>). No immunofluorescence
          was observed in tissue sections exposed to preabsorbed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisera</ENAMEX> or where the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antiserum</ENAMEX> had been omitted
          (data not shown).
          The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the bladder and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> was also determined using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA</ENAMEX> and expressed as
          ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX>/mg of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bladder</ENAMEX> had a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200.8</NUMEX> (Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.75</NUMEX>) ng/mg, whereas in the female bladder the MIF
          protein concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67.3 (Â± 13</NUMEX>) ng/mg. This
          difference was statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
          The MIF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration in the ventral lobe of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">144.1 (Â± 28.65</NUMEX>) ng/mg.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pelvic Ganglia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inferior</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mesenteric Ganglia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sympathetic Chain</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining was observed in cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX> of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. The staining intensity varied with
          some cells showing intense staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>) and most
          cells showing moderate to weak staining. Some of the more
          intensely stained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> also stained for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining was observed in
          sympathetic and parasympathetic cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurons</ENAMEX> in the inferior mesenteric ganglia also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">displayed MIF</ENAMEX> immunofluorescence. Cells showing
          immunofluorescence for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> were also observed
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 2C,2<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining in the inferior
          mesenteric ganglion appeared less intense overall than in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>. Small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells,
          intensely stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>, showed little to moderate MIF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>. Finally, nearly
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in the sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> showed some degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity. More intensely staining cells could
          be located that also stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the dorsal root ganglia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was observed over most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/</ENAMEX>S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> of rats of either sex. Some
          cells appeared intensely stained (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2G</ENAMEX>) and some of
          these intensely stained MIF-containing neurons also
          stained for substance P (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2H). Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>
          neurons showed weak MIF immunostaining. The satellite
          cells surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> neurons, however, were
          intensely stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> sections that were exposed to both the MIF
          blocking peptide and the antiserum or those that did not
          receive primary antiserum to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>, did not show any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Furthermore, in
          sections where one of the antisera (either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TH/SP</ENAMEX>)
          had been omitted, but still processed for double
          immunofluorescence, only the appropriate immunoreactivity
          was observed, indicating that the secondary antibodies
          were not cross reacting to produce spurious labeling
          (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the lumbosacral spinal cord
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX> spinal cord, many cells were
          immunostained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> antisera. Intensely stained cells
          were observed throughout the white matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). In
          addition, some intensely stained and some weakly stained
          cells were observed in the dorsal horn (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). The
          dorsal horn also showed diffuse staining that could not
          be associated with particular cells but was limited to
          the dorsal horn and did not extent to the intermediate
          grey matter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>).
          In the intermediate gray matter, weakly staining MIF
          positive cells were located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> around the
          central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IML region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 3C,3<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The
          ventral horns and particularly the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> were
          devoid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining (data not shown).
          In order to establish if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> stained cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> or glia, we employed double-immunofluorescence
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining cells in the
          white matter also showed GFAP staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>), as would
          be expected. In the dorsal horn, although the great
          majority of the MIF cells also localized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, indicating
          they were glial in origin, some cells also showed only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> could also
          be localized in neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B,4C</ENAMEX>). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IML</ENAMEX> region,
          only double-labeled cells were observed, suggesting that
          only glial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX> were detected in the IML
          region (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4D</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Results in the present study revealed the location of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX> in the bladder and prostate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and in
        the central and peripheral nervous system tissues that
        innervate these organs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> was localized mainly to epithelia of the bladder and
        the prostate. In the bladder, a relatively strong MIF
        staining was observed in the basal and intermediate layers
        of the urothelium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats confirming</ENAMEX> and
        extending our recent findings in male rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The
        superficial layer of the urothelium, on the other hand,
        contained relatively weak staining and areas devoid of MIF
        staining were often encountered. A similar pattern of MIF
        immunostaining was described for human epidermis with the
        basal layer displaying strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining and weaker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the more superficial layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . MIF
        staining was also observed in the acini of the ventral lobe
        of the prostate. In the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">acini</ENAMEX>, the labeling was
        limited to basal epithelial cells while columnar epithelial
        cells appeared devoid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunofluorescence. Proximal
        acini, however, showed intense staining in the cuboidal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelia</ENAMEX>. These differences in epithelial MIF staining
        within the bladder and the prostate suggest a change in MIF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> as epithelia undergo differentiation as has been
        reported for the eye lens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Basal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
        urothelium undergo proliferation to give rise to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> and superficial layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and MIF
        expression was correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> is
        involved in cell differentiation in the urothelium and in
        other organs, as suggested by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> investigations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . Alternatively, since the present study did not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualize MIF</ENAMEX> mRNA using in situ hybridization, it is
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the superficial layer of the
        urothelium synthesize MIF but release it more quickly than
        deeper epithelial cells.
        In addition to the epithelial staining, we also observed
        significant MIF staining in the bladder smooth muscle cells
        with some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> showing both cytoplasmic and nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. Weak MIF staining of the smooth muscle fibers
        around proximal acini was also observed. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have also reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining in
        smooth muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 19</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fibroblasts</ENAMEX> in the lamina propia
        of the bladder were also stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>. We observed a
        difference in the total bladder MIF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content between
        male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, with male rats having considerably
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX>. We were unable to locate reports of sex
        differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX> content in the literature. These
        preliminary findings are interesting but the physiological
        significance, if any, remains unclear at this point.
        Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> was described in the epithelia of
        several organs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The present findings
        provide anatomical evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX> in the bladder
        and prostate epithelia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and confirm our earlier
        findings demonstrating MIF expression in the bladder by
        immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis and RT-PCR
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . In other organs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX> stored in the
        epithelia was released upon endotoxemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . As such,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may form part of the innate immune response of
        different organs to bacterial infection.
        The exact role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the bladder and/or the prostate
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> is under investigation. Previously, we had shown
        that a chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cystitis model</ENAMEX> (intravesical hydrochloric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) decreased the overall MIF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content in the
        bladder. This effect was likely due to epithelial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denudation</ENAMEX>. However, histological evidence showed increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining over smooth muscle fiber bundles, perhaps
        indicating a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the early stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, intravesical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> (another
        commonly used cystitis model in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>) actually increased
        total bladder MIF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may be involved in the
        early responses of the bladder to inflammatory stimuli.
        Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content in the prostate
        actually decreased after intravesical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> (unpublished
        observations). These findings, although preliminary,
        suggest to us that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may be released from prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelia</ENAMEX> because of inflammatory events in other pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscera</ENAMEX> (in this case, the bladder) and this release may be
        mediated by neurogenic reflexes. If this is indeed the
        case, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may play a role in neurogenic inflammation
        and in visceral referred pain. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has
        been localized in the prostate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may serve as a prognostic marker for prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">serum</TIMEX> levels correlate with disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> may represent an
        important target for therapeutic intervention in bladder
        and prostate inflammation and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        The anatomical location of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been
        described for the adult rat brain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 20</NUMEX> ] . However, the
        spinal cord and peripheral nervous systems have received
        less attention [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . In addition to the bladder and
        the prostate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> appeared to be ubiquitous in neurons of
        the peripheral ganglia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
        Weak to moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining was observed in the
        neurons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>. The major pelvic ganglia contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholinergic</ENAMEX> and sympathetic neurons that innervate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bladder</ENAMEX>, prostate, colon and other pelvic viscera [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining was localized in both parasympathetic
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TH negative</NUMEX>) and sympathetic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> positive) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIF</ENAMEX> (also TH positive) cells also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contained MIF</ENAMEX>. These findings provide anatomical
        localization for our previous report of constitutive
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX> previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Finally, sympathetic neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> positive) in the inferior
        mesenteric ganglia and in the lumbar sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contained MIF</ENAMEX>. The lumbar sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> contains a
        large proportion of the sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons
        that innervate the bladder while the inferior mesenteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ganglion</ENAMEX> provides a much smaller contribution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Although not directly tested in the present experiment, it
        is possible that some of the post-ganglionic neurons that
        also stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> innervate the bladder and/or other
        pelvic viscera.
        We also observed many <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/</ENAMEX>S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> neurons that contained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>, as well as intensely stained satellite cells. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>
        neurons that were immunostained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> also co-contained
        the neurotransmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> P. Our findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> confirm earlier observations in the embryonic
        mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However, our findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX> in
        afferent neurons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> that also contain substance P
        represent a novel finding in the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, we observed substantial MIF immunostaining in
        the lumbosacral spinal cord of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. Glial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (GFAP
        positive) in the white matter and in the gray matter were
        intensely immunostained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>. Earlier investigations
        also reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining in the white matter of the
        spinal cord [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, we also observed cells in the
        dorsal horn that stained for MIF but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>,
        suggesting they were neuronal rather than glial cells. In
        the brain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunohistochemistry is found strongly in
        glial cells with neurons displaying weak (or no) staining [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, neurons in the brain appear to synthesize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and quickly release it so that nearby glial cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulate MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, without synthesizing it. It is
        possible that such a mechanism is at work at the level of
        the spinal cord.
        In addition to cellular labeling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>, we also
        observed terminal-like labeling over the dorsal horn of the
        lumbosacral spinal cord. This labeling was seen as a band
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> immunostaining that was darker in the superficial
        layers of the dorsal horn than in the deeper intermediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> matter. This pattern of labeling is suggestive of the
        terminal fields of afferent neurotransmitters and
        corroborates previous reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> terminal labeling in
        the brain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However, the staining was diffuse and
        individual nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (such as is the case with afferent
        neurotransmitter immunohistochemistry, for example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substance P</ENAMEX>) were not identified. Therefore, more work
        needs to be done to document whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> staining over
        the dorsal horn represents afferent terminal labeling or
        diffuse, glial labeling.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that may play a
        crucial role in initiating or maintaining several
        inflammatory conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In experimental models,
        treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX>, reversed or prevented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcer</ENAMEX> formation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in neurons in the brain and released into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSF</ENAMEX> following intracisternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> or spinal cord injury [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> is upregulated in the brain after
        reperfusion subsequent to ischemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, MIF
        is likely involved in the brain's response infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> or trauma.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Results from the present study establish that MIF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is located in epithelia and smooth muscle in two
        pelvic organs, the bladder and the prostate. Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-ganglionic</ENAMEX> (parasympathetic and sympathetic) and
        afferent neurons also contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX>. Finally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astrocytes</ENAMEX> and neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord
        contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF</ENAMEX>. The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the integration of pelvic
        viscera function is still under investigation. We have
        recently showed MIF upregulation in the bladder, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/</ENAMEX>S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> and in the lumbosacral cord after induction of
        acute bladder inflammation using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . The upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in central and peripheral
        nervous tissues following localized (i.e. bladder)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inflammation</ENAMEX> raises the interesting possibility that MIF
        may contribute to central and peripheral neurogenic events
        mediating inflammation. Although cytokines are
        traditionally associated with peripheral immune reactions
        as part of the innate response, evidence is accumulating
        that they may also be involved in normal brain function and
        may mediate pathological responses such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperalgesia</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . In fact, the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in glia of the
        spinal cord is particularly interesting since glial cells
        have been suggested as involved in hyperalgesia through the
        release of cytokines and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Given
        the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in the pelvic organs (bladder,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostate</ENAMEX>) and the central and peripheral nervous system
        tissues that innervate these organs, as well as the fact
        that bladder inflammation appears to upregulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> in
        these areas, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> represents a
        therapeutic target in reducing or preventing pelvic viscera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perfusion</ENAMEX> and tissue collection
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sprague-Dawley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX>, IN) rats
          were used in this study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> (weight = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">270-320 g</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female (weight = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">270-280 g</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were deeply
          anaesthetized with sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX>)
          and perfused transcardially with cold (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4Â°C</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX>
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M phosphate</ENAMEX>
          buffer. The following tissues were removed and placed in
          fixative at least overnight: bladder, ventral lobes of
          the prostate (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>), both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>, the inferior
          mesenteric ganglia (IMG), the sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L3-L5</ENAMEX>),

          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L6</NUMEX>-S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> spinal cord. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, the bladders and the
          ventral lobes of the prostate (in case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>) were
          dissected prior to perfusion. The bladder was divided in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> longitudinally, containing both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. One
          half of the bladder and a piece of the ventral lobes of
          the prostate were then placed in fixative <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF protein</ENAMEX> concentration of the remaining bladder and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> was determined using an ELISA procedure (see
          below).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistochemical</ENAMEX> procedures
          
            A) Single immunofluorescence
            Sections were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> normal serum (in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.01 M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer-saline, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X-100</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>) followed by incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (rabbit

            overnight. The antibody was visualized using an
            FITC-labeled secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (donkey anti-rabbit,
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Grove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). The slides were cover
            slipped with fade-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retardant</ENAMEX> media and examined using a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> microscope. Photographs were obtained using a

            CA) attached to the microscope.
          
          
            B) Double immunofluorescence
            Sections from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPG</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMG</ENAMEX> and the sympathetic
            chain were processed for double-immunofluorescence in
            order to visualize both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and tyrosine hydroxylase,
            as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sections</ENAMEX> were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> normal serum
            (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer-saline, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> Tx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>) followed by incubation with anti-MIF (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:200</ENAMEX>) and
            anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyclonal antibody</ENAMEX>;

            labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RITC</ENAMEX>, respectively.
            Sections from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> were processed for the
            visualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and substance P as follows:
            sections were exposed to anti-MIF (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:200</ENAMEX>) and
            anti-substance P (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig polyclonal</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>;

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were visualized using donkey anti rabbit and

            labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RITC</ENAMEX>, respectively.
            Some spinal cord sections were also processed for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> double-immunofluorescence as follows:
            Sections were incubated with anti-MIF (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:200</ENAMEX>) and
            anti-GFAP (mouse monoclonal; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chemicon</ENAMEX>). The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were visualized using donkey anti rabbit and
            donkey anti-sheep secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX>),
            labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RITC</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          
          
            C) Single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAP</ENAMEX> immunohistochemistry
            Free-floating sections from the spinal cord were
            processed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> using a standard
            peroxidase-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-peroxidase</ENAMEX> technique. Sections were
            exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> H

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to reduce endogenous peroxidase.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were then incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> normal serum
            (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer-saline, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> Tx-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>

            to a goat anti-rabbit antiserum (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>)
            for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, followed by exposure to goat-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX>;
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:100</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were reacted with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaminobenzidine</ENAMEX> intensified with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel ammonium</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfate</ENAMEX>. The slides were dehydrated, cleared in xylene
            and coverslipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permount</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments aimed to demonstrate the
            specificity of the staining with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and
            to rule out cross-reactivity of secondary antisera
            included: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) preabsorption controls: incubation of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIF antibody</ENAMEX> with the peptide used to produce the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) omission of the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
            omission of either one of the primary antisera used for
            double-immunofluorescence.

          Half of the bladders (containing both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>)
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, and the portions of the
          ventral lobes of the prostates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">male rats</ENAMEX> were
          assayed for MIF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Briefly, tissues were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenized</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHAPS</ENAMEX> buffer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-[3-Cholamidropropyl</ENAMEX>)

          and cleared tissue lysate prepared by centrifugation at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 g</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>. MIF concentrations within cell
          lysates were determined using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat MIF ELISA</ENAMEX> kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are presented as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mean (Â± S.E.M.</ENAMEX>) MIF
          concentration per mg of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of duplicate ELISA
          determinations for each tissue and from each experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> results were compared using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test and a significant difference was defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
