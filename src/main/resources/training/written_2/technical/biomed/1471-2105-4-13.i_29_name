        Alizadeh 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] did a large scale,
        long-term study of diffuse large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B-cell</ENAMEX> lymphoma (DLBCL),
        using microarray data chips. By doing cluster analysis on
        this data, they were able to diagnose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> with an
        accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> for this specific lymphoma; they were not
        able to predict which individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would survive to
        the end of the long-term study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prognostic</ENAMEX> Index for this disease was incorrect for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Cluster analysis, together with other statistical
        methods for identifying and correlating minimal gene lists
        with outcome, have become established as the primary tools
        for the analysis of microarray data in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> studies. We
        wished to test a different approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANN</ENAMEX>.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches to the analysis of microarray data
        differ substantially in their mode of operation. In the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> examination of the data, clustering, as applied in
        numerous recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> studies, is an unsupervised mapping
        of the input data examples based on the overall pairwise
        similarity of those examples to each other (here,
        similarity with respect to the expression levels of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>); the method is unsupervised in that no
        information of the desired outcome is provided. Subsequent
        analysis of the clusters in these studies generally
        attempts to reduce the gene set to the subset of genes that
        are most informative for the problem at hand. This step is
        a supervised step since there is an explicit effort to find
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlations</ENAMEX> in the pattern of gene expression that match
        the classification one is attempting to make among the
        input examples (see Discussion for specific examples). The
        input for this supervised step is the product of an
        unsupervised step. As this subselection is not routinely
        subjected to independent test using input examples
        originally withheld from the subselection process, it is
        generally not possible to judge how specifically the
        subselection choices relate to this specific set of
        examples as opposed to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of potential
        examples. To the extent that the gene set employed is much
        larger than the gene set that really determines the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>, it is possible that much of the clustering
        result will be based on irrelevant similarities.
        On the other hand, backpropagation neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are a
        supervised learning method that has an excellent reputation
        for classification problems. During the training phase, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANN</ENAMEX> are supplied with both the input data and the answer
        and are specifically tasked to make the classification of
        interest, given a training set of examples from all
        classes. That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANN</ENAMEX> are constantly checking to see if
        they have gotten the 'correct' answer, the answer being the
        actual classification not just the overall similarity of
        inputs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> accomplish this by continually adjusting their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> weighted connections to reduce the observed error
        in matching input to output. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> has achieved
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> that correctly identifies all training examples,
        the weights are fixed; it is then tested on input examples
        that were not part of the training set to see if the
        solution is a general one. It is only in this independent
        test that the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is judged.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> are not limited to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. It is
        feasible to train a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> using, say, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of
        the examples for training and holding back <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> for testing.
        A different <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> can be tested in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and so
        on. In this way, with the training of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, each
        input can be found in a test set one time and can,
        therefore, be independently evaluated. The data presented
        below, with the exception of a few cases, are the output of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten slightly</NUMEX> different trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, operating in test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>, which collectively evaluate the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> pool.
        This 'round-robin' procedure was employed, in duplicate, in
        every trial described throughout this work. The fact that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ends up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is not an impediment to
        analysis since any future examples could be submitted to
        all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> for evaluation, with a majority poll
        deciding the classification. That is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in
        agreement on a particular input datum would determine the
        classification of that input. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are, of
        course, likely to be very similar in that their training
        sets differ only slightly.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major advantage of backpropagation networks
        follows from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Not only are neural networks
        trained to the specific question, rather than a loose
        derivative of that question, and tested for generality, but
        they can also be asked for a quantitative assessment of how
        they got the correct answer. Numerical partial
        differentiation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with respect to a given test
        input example [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s
        evaluation of the relative impact of each gene in arriving
        at the correct answer for this particular input. Cluster
        analysis, including the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX>, has no
        corresponding highly focused sight for targeting specific
        similarities as opposed to non-specific similarities. To
        the extent that this is true, neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> should be
        able to identify relatively small gene subsets which will
        significantly outperform the initial gene sets in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and which will also significantly outperform
        the gene subsets suggested by cluster analysis.
      
      
        Results
        
          Determining patient prognosis from microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          Cluster analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4</NUMEX> ] had shown that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> gene
          expression panels for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> DLBCL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> contained some
          information relevant to the question of prognosis but
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not make an attempt to provide survival
          predictions for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          We wished to see if the neural network strategy, of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">train</ENAMEX>, test, differentiate, retrain on the reduced gene
          set, and retest, could produce any useful result with
          respect to prognosis on an individual basis. The approach
          would be: [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] use the entire gene set without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preprocessing</ENAMEX> to train a network, testing to confirm that
          it had at least a good fit to the problem and, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] use
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s definition of the problem, by
          differentiating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, to focus on those genes most
          essential to the classification. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would then
          form the basis for training new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with hopefully
          improved performance. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained for
          this study. Figure 1shows a work flow schematic for this
          study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1provides</ENAMEX> a summary overview of the data,
          including data not shown.
          Initially a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was trained to accept microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4026</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12078</NUMEX> input neurons with a
          semi-quantitative assessment of each gene, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          middle-layer neurons, and a single output neuron. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were originally designed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 input bits</NUMEX> per
          datum: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for sign,'-' = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for quantitative
          degree of signal with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX> being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">01</TIMEX> being ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> being ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> being ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>.
          Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'011</ENAMEX>' would indicate a particular gene whose
          expression, relative to control, was increased at a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">magnitude >2</ENAMEX>. The training set included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> being held back as test data.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was trained by processing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> iterations of
          the complete training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. The test set, drawn from a
          mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, was then run. The
          entire process was then repeated with a different choice
          of test data each time. In this round-robin fashion, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> serve as test data for one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and
          each training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> is necessarily slightly different. A
          round robin series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> was generated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          underlying Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> report
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://llmpp.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/lymphoma/</ENAMEX>data.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shtmlwere</ENAMEX> used for
          training. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were asked to predict, based on
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> gene set, which of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would
          survive to the end of the study (longest point = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yrs</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> initially varied with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1 to 3</TIMEX> errors
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> each, for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> correctly predicted (data not shown). 1However,
          a trained neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> can be numerically
          differentiated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] to show the relative dependence of
          the output (classification) on each active input neuron
          within an input vector. Briefly stated, the
          differentiation process involves slightly perturbing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> (down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0 to 0.85</NUMEX>) of each active input
          neuron, one at a time, to note the specific change in the
          output value. In that there is one gene for each active
          node, the largest change in the output points to the most
          influential gene. We then trained qualitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 bits</NUMEX> per gene, on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> gene set in order to
          differentiate them (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">'1 0</ENAMEX>' for expression greater than, or
          equal to, the control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'0 1</NUMEX>' for less than the control).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> middle layer neurons. This coding has
          the effect that there is an active neuron for each gene
          in the set regardless of expression level and the total
          number of active input neurons is constant from input to
          input. By taking the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of 12</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiations</ENAMEX> and requiring agreement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in choosing each gene, we obtained a set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. (These cutoff criteria are necessarily
          arbitrary and are only justified by subsequent proof that
          they produced gene subsets having the desired
          information.) A round-robin series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> each, produced a single error (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DLCL0018</NUMEX>) in
          survival predictions when trained on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round-robin training with the
          same gene set produced no errors, correctly evaluating
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> test sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          For a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study, we took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and held them
          in reserve to model information from a "follow-up" study.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained, on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> gene set, using
          the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; each had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
          training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the test set. Collectively, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> made no errors in the prognosis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          The data for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> reserve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were then tested on
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> to emulate follow-up data. Out of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> errors distributed
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. A poll of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, therefore,
          produced no errors by a majority, correctly classifying
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the follow-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.(data not
          shown)
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> cases,
          the gene chosen as most influential in determining the
          correct prognosis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18593</NUMEX>, a tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase</ENAMEX> receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. While this gene set may not be the absolute best
          possible, it clearly does contain sufficient information
          for error-free predictions on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
          identification of this gene set will hopefully lead
          eventually to a better understanding of the interaction
          of these genes in this disease as a result of future
          studies.
        
        
          Diagnosing lymphoma from microarray data
          The diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> lymphoma by biopsy is not
          trivial. Even with gene expression data, clustering
          techniques produced a misreading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] , a result unimproved in their hands by further
          analysis of reduced gene panels. We wished to see if back
          propagation neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> could do better using the
          same data set. Figure 2shows a work flow schematic for
          this study. This testing over the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> set with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4026</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> errors in diagnosis (data not
          shown).
          Thus, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANN</ENAMEX> merely match cluster
          analysis. In preparation for differentiation, a network
          was trained with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> sets as the first network
          above, but coded qualitatively. This network correctly
          classified the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the test set (data not
          shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> from the test set were each
          used, in turn, to differentiate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In these
          cases, the first criterion for selection was broad: the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> had to contribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10%</NUMEX> as much as the gene
          making the maximum contribution to the correct
          classification; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> criterion was that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> had to agree on the selection. This
          produced a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The number of genes
          referenced by a given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> under identical criteria
          ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 to 1448</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 38%</NUMEX> of the genes overlapped
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">670</NUMEX> gene subset identified by cluster analysis. It
          was of interest to see if these genes were sufficient for
          correct classification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> gene subset. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ly1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DLBCL0009</ENAMEX> and tonsil) errors were produced
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> separate series (data not shown).
          At this point, the neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were doing a
          much-improved diagnosis; it remained to be seen if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> set could be further refined. The set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          was then treated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ways: [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] it was
          arbitrarily split into even and odd halves, with each
          half being used to train <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] it was
          used whole to train <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> qualitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> for further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were then trained using a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">odd</TIMEX> or even numbered) subset of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> gene
          set in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. The odd set again produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          errors (data not shown). In the even set, a single error
          was made over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> different test sets,
          identifying the 'tonsil' inlier in the earlier cluster
          analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] as positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained on the even set with the same
          result (data not shown).
          The differentiation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> gene
          set pointed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Given the high accuracy of the
          even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> gene set, we also trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> on this set
          for differentiation. These pointed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> additional
          genes. In these cases, only genes in the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> in
          influence chosen in common by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 25%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiated</ENAMEX> examples were considered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> trained
          on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> errors over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
          test sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, using the designation
          from the initial report, are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>.
          We also wished to test this gene set in the context of
          a follow-up study. For this purpose, we set aside <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> as "follow-up" data, using the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>
          in the usual training/testing round robin. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> training vectors and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          test vectors and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> training vectors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. Collectively, these produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> errors over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> correct. The follow-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> were then
          tested on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. A poll of these networks
          showed a majority vote for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> error or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> correct.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The rather remarkable conclusion of this analysis is
        that there is sufficient information in a single gene
        expression time point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5 dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to provide
        perfect prognosis (out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>) and near-perfect
        diagnosis for this set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, through a strategy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and differentiate,
        bring that information to the fore by progressively
        focusing on the genes within the larger set which are most
        responsible for the correct classifications, providing at
        once a reduction in the noise level and specific donor
        profiles. This focus on the specific classification problem
        led to a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for prognosis and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for diagnosis. These sets are mutually exclusive.
        The gene subsets suggested by cluster analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] are
        not supersets of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">670</NUMEX> gene set of the
        initial report captured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> gene set used for
        diagnosis and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX> gene staging set captured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> gene set used for prognosis. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> gene subset
        proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastie</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] for prognosis contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> gene set. There was no overlap with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gene
        set identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shipp</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] to correlate with their
        cured/fatal classes for this disease. At first, it might
        seem surprising that the gene subsets identified here do
        not appear to be subsets of those identified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> by
        Alizadeh 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . But this surprise is based on
        a naive intuition. The fact is that we do not know the
        level of information redundancy that exists in these large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. Apropos of this point, Alon 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] discarded the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>
        genes indicated by cluster analysis as most discriminatory
        in their study of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and, upon reclustering,
        found their diagnosis unimpaired. Likewise, it may be that
        while the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might be sufficient for
        perfect classification, so might the next <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. These sets
        by definition are mutually exclusive. By extension, it is
        not difficult to believe that some other large gene set
        might be able to get <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the classifications correct
        with little or no overlap with those genes in the top
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>.
        We have been careful to avoid any claim that the gene
        sets extracted in this procedure are the "best" gene sets.
        Only in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, highly qualified sense can they be said to be
        best; that is in classifying 
        this data set there are no other
        gene sets which offer a statistically significant
        improvement in classification accuracy. That is not to say
        that there may not be other sets which could do as well.
        Nor is there any implication that these genes are seminal
        in the etiology of this disease. They may not be necessary
        but they are sufficient to do this classification. They may
        not be sufficient to the classification of a much larger
        patient set. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are unlikely to be fully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. It should be noted, however, that the same caveats
        apply to the analysis of these data by any other
        method.
        There have been a number of additional studies of cancer
        using microarray data for either prognostic or diagnostic
        purposes. The following listing includes a brief discussion
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of these studies:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Shipp 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] did a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> DLBCL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> follicular lymphoma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. They first
        sought to classify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. They clustered
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6817</TIMEX> genes. Using their own weighted combination of
        informative gene markers, they picked out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> genes whose
        expression levels would be used to do a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>. They correctly classified 71/77 patients
        for a diagnostic accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>. They then attempted to
        develop high risk and low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with respect to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> prognosis. They used several different methods for
        associating particular gene clusters with survival outcome:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan Meier</ENAMEX> analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Support Vector Machine</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> analysis. They selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">informative</ENAMEX> and achieved the best result with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVM</ENAMEX> modeling.
        They did not explicitly state how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> initially
        sorted into the high risk/low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> but other data
        suggest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 and 41</TIMEX> respectively. The only way in which these
        survival probability plots can be compared to the patient
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> predictions presented above is to associate low
        risk with survival and high risk with non-survival (Please
        note:this equation was not made by any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, with
        the exception of [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] below, discussing risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>). If
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> makes this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, their best result is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14/58</NUMEX>
        errors for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> yr. survival accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Rosenwald 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] did what they termed a
        follow-up study on the original Alizadeh 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        However, it was not really a follow-up study because a
        different chip was used for the microarray data. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alizadeh</ENAMEX> study identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on an analysis of
        weighting the gene cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> B
        cell-like tumors which correlated with low risk and
        activated B cell-like tumors which correlated with high
        risk. If these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, the prognosis accuracy would have been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>.
        In the follow-up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found it necessary to
        introduce a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not
        fit either of the previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> categories. Although lacking
        the associated gene profile, this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a
        survival pattern much like the activated B cell-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards modeling to
        assign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on the basis of the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> yr. survival for the low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> for
        the activated B cell-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        An improved result was obtained using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> drawn from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        signature gene groupings plus a score for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP6</TIMEX> expression.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan Meier</ENAMEX> estimates of survival were determined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        quartiles for which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> yr. survival rate was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%,71%,34%,15%</NUMEX>. If these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> are collapsed into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> categories
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>, it would produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62/240</NUMEX>
        errors for a prognosis accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) van't Veer 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] did a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Starting with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> signature
        genes, they narrowed down the gene pool to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by
        examining the correlation coefficient of each gene with the
        prognostic outcome. They then rank ordered these genes and
        added them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> at a time to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-man-out test of their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for predicted outcome. This was repeated until an
        optimum outcome classification was reached. This occurred
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> classification based on
        the weighting of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was able to produce a
        survival classification with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13/78</NUMEX> errors for an accuracy
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> in the study. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        originally assigned to the low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> to the
        high risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> yr. survival rates
        were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83% and 40%</NUMEX>. If treated as survival categories this
        would produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12/41</NUMEX> errors for a prognosis classification
        accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>. Although these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> had complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> yr.
        survival data on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study, they at
        no point attempted to analyze this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> specifically for
        direct comparison with predictions.

        was used to reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2308</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> components. Neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/3</NUMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> pool to

        lymphoblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALL</ENAMEX>). Starting with the expression
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6817</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, they did a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>. They then did a neighbor analysis to identify
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100</TIMEX> genes occurring above chance levels which related to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>/ALL distinction. They choose an informative subset
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to weight for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> assignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        They were able to correctly classify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29/34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for a
        diagnostic accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>. They next attempted to use
        self-organizing-maps (SOM) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> classes in place of the
        initial clustering. This produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4/38</NUMEX> errors for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX>
        diagnostic accuracy. Drawing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> gene predictor from these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOM</ENAMEX> classes, they again produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/38</NUMEX> errors, maintaining a
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> accuracy. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also attempted to use array

        without success.
        The identification of specific genes associated with a
        particular biological characteristic such as malignant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> would be useful in many settings, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] Precise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and staging of tumors is critical for the
        selection of the appropriate therapy. At present,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> is accomplished by morphologic,
        immunohistochemical, and limited biological analyses.
        Neural net analysis in the form of specific donor profiles
        could provide a fine structure analysis of tumors
        characterizing them by a precise weighting of the genes,
        which they express differentially. At present, only subsets
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a given type of tumor respond to therapy.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> trained to distinguish responders from
        non-responders would allow a comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-expressed
        genes in responders and non-responders to find those genes
        most predictive of response. Recently we have used neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> on the data of Perou 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] for classifying breast
        tumors as hormonally responsive or non-responsive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX>
        that gave a perfect classification with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">496</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> pointed
        to a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Retraining on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        produced no error in classifying 62 tissue samples from
        their study (unpublished data). We have also analyzed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data of Dhanasekaran</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Here the original set
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9984</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Retraining on these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> gave no errors in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-way (normal, early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>,

        (unpublished data). Given the significant impairment in the
        quality of life for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing chemotherapy
        and/or radiation therapy, such prospective information
        would be extremely beneficial. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] T cell and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody-mediated immunotherapy</ENAMEX> may be efficacious
        approaches for limiting tumor growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. At
        present there is a paucity of known tumor rejection
        antigens that can be targeted. Neural net analysis may
        identify a panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> shared by many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and thereby provide a
        repertoire of potentially novel tumor rejection antigens. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> the target

        specific markers of the target organ through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neural</TIMEX> net
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> could identify potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> antigens as

        Conclusions
        We believe neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> will be an ideal tool to
        assimilate the vast amount of information contained in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. The artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> presented here were
        not selected from a large number of attempts. The networks
        described here are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> attempts with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and format stated; the longest training session lasted
        less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. Indeed, the trained neural network
        may, in the form of its weight matrix, have the best
        possible "understanding" of the very broad statement being
        made in the microarray, a view that is accessible with the
        differentiation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In this study, that
        viewpoint suggested a small subset of genes, which proved
        sufficient to give a near-perfect classification in each of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> problems. This approach should be suitable for any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> study and, indeed, other global studies such as
        2-D <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gels</ENAMEX> and mass-spec data which contain sufficient
        information for training.
      
      
        Methods
        The data from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments are stored in
        spreadsheet form, representing the positive or negative
        level of expression, relative to some control <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>'s of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more experimental conditions. A
        short software program is sufficient to translate these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> directly into a binary representation suitable as
        input vectors for a neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. The neural network
        software used throughout this study was NeuralWorks
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II Plus</ENAMEX> v.5.3.Neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained on
        the corresponding data sets, with a fraction of the data,
        typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, withheld for testing purposes. All open
        fields in the data array were set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The trained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were then asked to classify new test data as to
        donor type. Since the gene expression levels are read
        directly from the spreadsheet, their order and names are
        provided by the spreadsheet. Given the large amount of
        input data, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> generally converge to a low
        error level very quickly during training, often in a few
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> or less. Subsequently additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were
        trained with a simplified input that contained only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> information in the form of a plus or minus sign
        to characterize the expression of each gene in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>.
        This reduced the input size to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 bits</NUMEX> per gene, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> for
        below the control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> for above, or equal to, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. The output neuron was trained to output <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> for a
        positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX> for a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>; for the prognostic networks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
        indicated a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> gene
        panel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was provided, respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        middle-layer neurons for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> bit or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> bit per gene
        inputs. With a very large number of input neurons it is
        possible to overload the middle-layer neurons, effectively
        always operating them at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> extreme limit or the other;
        this can have the undesirable effect of reducing their
        sigmoid transfer function to a step function, with the loss
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s non-linearity. This is clearly indicated
        if multiple output values are found to be exactly
        identical. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> were trained to an error level below
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> after which they were tested with previously unseen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. A possible disadvantage of neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>,
        especially with a large input space and a relatively small
        sample number, is overtraining. In overtraining, a network
        can learn the specifics of each training example as opposed
        to finding a global solution for the entire training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>.
        This behavior is characterized by a degradation in test
        scores as training sessions are extended. Although we saw
        no evidence of this in this study, we did look to see how
        much additional training would be necessary to degrade the
        test results in the case of the initial diagnosis networks
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4026</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. It was not until we doubled the training
        iterations dictated by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> output error cutoff that we
        saw some increased test error. At double the normal
        training interval, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were unchanged, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> showed an increased error of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This is
        suggestive, but not proof, of the onset of overtraining.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> trained on the reduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> gene sets had
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> middle-layer neurons.
        To differentiate a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with respect to
        specific inputs, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was trained on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> gene
        panel with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 bits</NUMEX> per gene. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> from the
        test set were each differentiated, using software that we
        designed for that purpose [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        then compared among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sets, with genes occurring in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        or more instances being included in the final subset. This
        requirement generated a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the
        original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> were trained on this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subset</ENAMEX> and on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 146</NUMEX> gene subsets, representing every
        other gene from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> set. All were coded with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 bits</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and employed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 or 12</NUMEX> middle-layer
        neurons, respectively. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were trained on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> gene set and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> 'even' set, coded with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 bits</NUMEX> per
        gene for subsequent differentiation.
        The differentiation of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel networks</ENAMEX> trained
        for prognosis arbitrarily employed more selective criteria
        (see text) for subset determination with the result that a
        single differentiation reduced the gene set from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4026</TIMEX> genes
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> demonstrated that this was
        a highly effective selection.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in this study were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-layer back
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> trained with a learning coefficient of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> and a momentum coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> using the generalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> learning rule and the standard sigmoidal transfer
        function. The cutoff, in all cases, between positive and
        negative scoring was taken to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMS</ENAMEX> error at the
        output neuron No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> required more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 minutes</TIMEX>
        training time on a PC at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mh</ENAMEX>; in the majority of cases,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was fully trained in less than a minute.
        Training and testing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> network round-robin series could
        generally be done in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 20 minutes</TIMEX>. Training was
        deliberately kept to a minimum to avoid over-training. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> represented here were in each case the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> attempt result for the given problem. There was no
        "data trolling."
