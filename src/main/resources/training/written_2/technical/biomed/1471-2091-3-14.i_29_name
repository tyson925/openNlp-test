        Whole-genome expression profiling exemplified by the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarrays represents a major advance
        in genome-wide functional analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In a single
        assay, the transcriptional response of each gene to a
        change in cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> can be measured, whether it is a
        viral infection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cell cycle changes, chemical
        treatment, or genetic perturbation. Specifically,
        systematic approaches for identifying the biological
        functions of cellular genes altered during these changes,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> infection, are needed to ensure rapid
        progress in defining significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and viral genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in directed experimentation and applications.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> can be inferred from the
        expression profiles, and the notion that the global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response constitutes a detailed molecular
        phenotype, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> discovery, class prediction, drug
        target validation, and the classification of tumors by
        expression profiling has begun to receive considerable
        attention [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Since its discovery, much of the mainstream human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunodeficiency</ENAMEX> virus type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HIV-1</NUMEX>) Tat research has
        focused on its ability to activate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the HIV-1</TIMEX> LTR. However,
        to date, besides the transactivation activity on the HIV-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, few other effects exerted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-1 Tat</ENAMEX> on
        cellular and viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has also been observed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been shown to transcriptionally repress host
        cellular genes and be involved in the immunosuppression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with viral infection. For instance, HIV-1
        infection is able to down-regulate major histocompatibility
        complex type I (MHC-I) by various different viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        including Tat which represses the transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MHC-I</ENAMEX>,
        Vpu which retains nascent MHC-I chains in the endoplasmic
        reticulum, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nef</ENAMEX> which can mediate selective
        internalization of MHC-I molecules from the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I gene expression has also been shown
        to be reduced upon infection with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LAI</ENAMEX> virus
        or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> exon one recombinant virus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> has been shown to down-regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mannose</ENAMEX> receptor,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EDF-1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR/CD3</ENAMEX> surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Tat
        reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mannose receptor</ENAMEX> levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity in
        mature macrophages and dendritic cells by interfering with
        the host <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> machinery; resulting in decreased
        levels of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mannose receptor</ENAMEX> needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>
        (mannosylated albumin uptake) or pathogen capture
        (Pneumocystis carinii phagocytosis), and eventual delivery
        to MHC class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II-containing intracellular compartments</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EDF-1</ENAMEX>, a gene down-regulated when endothelial cells are
        induced to differentiate 
        in vitro , was shown to be
        down-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> at the transcriptional level,
        resulting in the inhibition of endothelial cell growth and
        in the transition from a nonpolar cobblestone phenotype to
        a polar fibroblast-like phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        When examining the 
        in vivo effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 Tat protein</ENAMEX>
        in the 
        Xenopus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, it was found that
        upon injection of synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat mRNA</ENAMEX> into zygotes, a marked
        delay in gastrulation occurred. This led to the altered
        specification of the anterior-posterior axis and partial
        loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior embryo structures</ENAMEX>. Mechanistically,
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> elicited a general suppression of gene
        expression, including that of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xbra</ENAMEX> and 
        gsc , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> early genes whose
        expression are required for proper gastrulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In relation to the cell cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> has also been shown
        to bind to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p53</NUMEX> and inhibit the transcription of p53
        responsive elements, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p21/</ENAMEX>Waf1 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        Consequently, upon introduction of stress signals (e.g.,
        gamma irradiation), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-infected cells lose their G1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/S</ENAMEX>
        checkpoint, enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> inappropriately, and apoptose
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Finally, the inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">translational</ENAMEX> machinery has also been noted. The potential
        translational inhibitory effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR RNA</ENAMEX> region is
        mediated by the activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p68</TIMEX> (the interferon-induced
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>-kilodalton <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>) kinase, which was
        down-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> during productive HIV-1 infection [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] .
        Although the mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cellular
        down-regulation remains largely unknown, few reports have
        attempted to decipher the mechanism of the observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX>. For instance, the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated the expression of the inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressor</ENAMEX> (ICER), a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-responsive
        element modulator transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, in a
        cAMP-dependent manner. In turn, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICER</ENAMEX> overexpression
        abrogated the transcriptional activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>,
        strongly suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICER</ENAMEX>'s involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>-mediated
        inhibition of gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Aside from induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICER</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> is capable of forming
        complex (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX>) with a component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX>, TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 250</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tip60</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] both of
        which contain histone acetyltransferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAT</ENAMEX>) activity. In
        these cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>-TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 250</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat-Tip60</ENAMEX> do not affect the
        transcription from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>, but interfere with the
        transcription activity of cellular genes. It is postulated
        that different targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HATs by Tat</ENAMEX> have different
        consequences. The interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat with p300/CBP</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P/CAF</ENAMEX> stimulates its ability to transactivate LTR-dependent
        transcription, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>-TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 250</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat-Tip60</ENAMEX> interactions control
        the transcription of cellular genes.
        Here to better understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>, we
        have performed microarray experiments on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected
        cells expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX>. To our surprise many host
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were down-regulated when comparing HIV-1
        infected latent cells to uninfected parental cells. Because
        most, if not all, latent infected cells available to date
        (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACH2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J1.1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">OM.10</NUMEX>) have various expression
        levels of doubly spliced viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rev</ENAMEX>,
        Nef, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vpr</ENAMEX>, and other accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we decided to
        perform the microarray in a system where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed; asking whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tat</ENAMEX> by itself, or
        in the absence of other accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, could still
        down-regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cellular genes. Consistent with latently
        infected cells, we found many cellular genes to be
        down-regulated in Tat expressing lymphocytes. The
        down-regulation is most apparent on cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that
        have intrinsic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor tyrosine kinase</ENAMEX> (RTK) activity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTK</ENAMEX> function;
        including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ras-Raf-MEK</ENAMEX> pathway, and co-activators such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p300/CBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRC-1</ENAMEX>, which mediate gene expression
        related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone receptor genes</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, we also
        observed up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S-phase genes</ENAMEX>, as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal genes</ENAMEX> involved in translation. Functionally,
        down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may allow latent HIV-1
        infected cells to either hide from the immune system or
        avoid extracellular differentiation signals normally
        regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up</NUMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> and
        translation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may allow speeding of cells through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> and subsequent accumulation at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G2</NUMEX> phase, where
        most of the cellular and viral translation may take place.
        Therefore, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> may not only control
        activated transcription on HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>, but also aid in the
        subsequent translation of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          It has long been known that infection by HIV-1
          commonly leads to the down-regulation and the
          disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4 receptors</ENAMEX> from the plasma membrane,
          a phenomenon referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> down-modulation.
          This, in turn, renders cells refractory to subsequent
          infection by the same or other viruses that use the CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for entry; thus creating a state of
          super-infection immunity. Results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1indicate</ENAMEX> that
          although few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor genes</ENAMEX> were up-regulated, most of
          the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in general, were down-regulated in
          the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX>. Most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          or membranous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were initially discovered from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> or neuronal cells, hence they were given names
          related to the immune or nervous system. For instance,
          mRNA for the neuropeptide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# X71635</NUMEX>),
          which was up-regulated in Tat expressing cells, was
          initially discovered as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein coupled neuropeptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> receptor, and later found to be homologous to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor CCR5</ENAMEX> needed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infection of
          monocyte/macrophage cells. Therefore, most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receptors</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1may</ENAMEX> in fact be expressed in
          various tissues and have multiple functions.
          Consistent with our microarray results on CCR5
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation, experiments performed in peripheral blood
          mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (PBMCs) with soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> has shown
          selective entry and replication of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX> virus into cells
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up</NUMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> coreceptor by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> has
          also been reported, where a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX> that
          was immobilized on a solid substrate, up-regulated the
          surface expression of the chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of primary resting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells. Also, a
          similar result was seen from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX> actively
          released by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected cells, implying a potentially
          important role for extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> in rendering the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bystander</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4+ T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> more susceptible to infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          ] .
          We therefore tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H9/Tat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, which showed
          an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX> expression, could in fact allow
          better entry and infection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CCR5</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R5</NUMEX>) virus into
          cells. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ashows</NUMEX> the result of such an experiment,
          where H9<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Tat</ENAMEX> cells allowed a better replication profile
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the R5</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CXCR4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X4</NUMEX>) virus. The increase in
          viral titer peaked after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 18 days</TIMEX> of infection with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R5</NUMEX> virus, further implying that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR5</NUMEX> co-receptor
          allowed a better selection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R5</TIMEX> virus in Tat expressing
          cells.
          Another example of co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with multiple
          functions is the leukotriene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B4</ENAMEX>, which was
          down-regulated in Tat expressing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acc# D89078</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The cysteinyl leukotrienes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CysLT</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTD</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTE</ENAMEX>, were first shown to be essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . However, when the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukotriene</ENAMEX> B4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m-BLTR</ENAMEX>) gene, was cloned it was shown to have
          significant sequence homology with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptors</ENAMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5 and CXCR4</TIMEX>), co-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for many different HIV-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clades</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Along the same lines, when cells were
          infected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> primary clinical isolates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>,
          leukotriene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B4 receptor</ENAMEX> was primarily utilized for
          efficient entry into cells which were mainly of the
          syncytium-inducing phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Therefore,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation of neuropeptide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and
          down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukotriene B4 receptor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>
          expressing cells indicates a selective advantage of one
          class of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCR5</NUMEX>) over another (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCR4</NUMEX>).
          Other examples of consistency between our microarray
          results on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">HIV-1 Tat</ENAMEX> literature,
          include the down-regulation of gene expression in uPAR
          (Acc<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># X74039</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IP3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acc# D26070</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D26351</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Glu R</ENAMEX> flop
          (Acc<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># U10302</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# L07592</NUMEX>), alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> macroglobulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# M63959</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acc# L36645</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U66406</TIMEX>) genes.
          The transmembranous urokinase-type plasminogen
          activator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (uPAR; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD87</ENAMEX>) focuses the formation of
          active plasmin at the cell surface, thus enhancing
          directional extracellular proteolysis. Interestingly, the
          promoter activity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD87</NUMEX> gene was shown to decline
          after infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , implying that post integration
          of HIV-1 may in fact down-regulate CD87 gene expression.
          Similarly, inositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IP3R</NUMEX>)
          are intracellular calcium release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> involved in
          diverse signaling pathways and are required for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation of T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (also implicated

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Down-regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IP3</TIMEX> may therefore
          contribute to viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">latency</ENAMEX> and maintenance of an
          anti-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in cells.
          HIV-1 infection can cause extensive neuronal loss and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX>, a severe dementia. The cause of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> remains unclear as neurons are not
          infected, but the disturbance of glutamate-linked calcium
          entry has been implicated. It has been shown that
          HIV-infected brain has a decrease of mRNA and protein of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GluR</ENAMEX>-A flop subtype of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-</ENAMEX>isoxazole propionic acid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor</ENAMEX> in cerebellar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purkinje</ENAMEX> cells.
          The observed disturbance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA receptors</ENAMEX> may contribute
          to the neurotoxic process in other vulnerable brain
          regions and clinically to the development of dementia [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
          the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoculation</ENAMEX>. Thus, the reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA</ENAMEX> receptor density
          may contribute to the development of the cognitive
          abnormalities associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> who are receiving therapy
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 protease inhibitors</ENAMEX> have been reported to be
          afflicted with a syndrome characterized by lipodystrophy
          (fat redistribution favoring the accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abdominal</ENAMEX> and cervical adipose tissue), hyperlipidemia,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance. Potential mechanisms for altered
          adipocyte function include, direct binding to PPARgamma
          or inhibition of transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARgamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lipodystrophy syndrome</ENAMEX> may be a result of the
          inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in lipid metabolism
          that have significant homology to the catalytic site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> proteases; namely cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein type 1</ENAMEX> and low density
          lipoprotein-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . An
          additional mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPAR</ENAMEX> down-regulation may be
          related to Tat expression in latent cells.
        
        
          Translation associated factors
          Viruses have evolved a remarkable variety of
          strategies to modulate the host cell translation
          apparatus with the aim of optimizing viral mRNA
          translation and replication. For instance, viruses
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herpes</ENAMEX> simplex virus type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HSV-1</NUMEX>) have been
          known to induce severe alterations of the host
          translational apparatus, including the up-regulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> and the progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VP19C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VP26</TIMEX>, and
          the poly(A)-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PAB1P</NUMEX>) to ribosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
          . In the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one</NUMEX> infectious
          HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> in an infected cell could be transcribed and
          translated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000 to 100,000</NUMEX> physical particles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          ] . This poses an immense challenge for the virus to be
          able to transcribe, splice, transport, and translate its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into fully packaged virions in a timely fashion.
          Therefore, it would be advantageous for the virus to set
          the stage for each successive step necessary for viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progeny</ENAMEX> formation. One such event is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>'s ability to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> genes that aid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">translational</TIMEX> machinery. As
          seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, many of the critical components of a
          functional ribosome, including large subunits <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L 3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 26</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 38</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>, as well as S <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 12, 20</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>, and many
          of the translation initiation factors are up-regulated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. This would imply that Tat up-regulates many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal genes</ENAMEX> that may be necessary to produce
          functional ribosomes needed for viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> translation.
          Therefore, interfering with translation could provide a
          new strategy for anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment. Along these lines,
          when the aminogylcosides (kanamycin, hygromycin B,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paromycin</ENAMEX> and neomycin) due to their ability to inhibit
          protein synthesis by affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal fidelity</ENAMEX>, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puromycin</ENAMEX> because of its competing ability with tRNAs for
          binding on the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX>, or cycloheximide
          which inhibit the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX> by preventing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribosomal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> along the mRNA, were used in active
          HIV-1 infection, it was found that both cycloheximide and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puromycin</ENAMEX> produced the greatest decrease in HIV-1
          inhibition, presumably by inhibiting the large subunit of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ribosome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
          Translation of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> pose a challenge since they
          all contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR sequence</ENAMEX> at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end. The
          Tat-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> exhibits a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-inhibitory effect on translation by activating the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>-induced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>-kilodalton <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>.
          Productive infection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> has been shown to result in
          a significant decrease in the amount of cellular p68
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX>. The steady-state amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p68</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> was found
          to be reduced in cells stably expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. Thus, the
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> inhibitory effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR RNA</ENAMEX>
          region, mediated by activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p68</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, may be
          down-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> during activation of the latent
          virus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Along these lines, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> peptide
          antagonist, which bound specifically to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR RNA</ENAMEX> and
          competed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> for binding, reduced Tat-dependent
          translation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
          Finally, upregulation of translation genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>
          expressing cells is specially intriguing in light of the
          recent discovery of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs)
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> gag <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRESs</ENAMEX> are thought to promote
          initiation of translation by directly binding to
          ribosomes, in a manner independent of the mRNA cap or of
          scanning through upstream sequences. Since, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> is
          located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 RNA transcripts</ENAMEX> and
          the presence of secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at or near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> reduces the accessibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' cap to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF4F</TIMEX>,
          it is thought that this feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> can
          inhibit their cap-dependent translation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] .
          Therefore, a possible function of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> gag IRES
          might be to serve as a mechanism to bypass the structural
          barriers to cap-dependent translation by recruiting
          ribosomes easily and directly to the gag <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>. IRES
          entirely contained within a translated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> has been shown
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMLV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gag</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoding</ENAMEX> p110
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PITSLREand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p58 PITSLRE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Along these lines,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap-dependent</ENAMEX> translation may be cell cycle regulated,
          especially when cells are arrested at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G2</NUMEX> phase of the
          cell cycle, where the cap-dependent translation of most
          cellular host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell mRNAs</ENAMEX> is inhibited [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Modulation of signal transduction pathway
          Results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3indicate</ENAMEX> that many seemingly
          different pathways are being regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. However,
          the signal transduction pathway, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX>, has been shown to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and be upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-replication</ENAMEX>,
          transcription, and cell cycle pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53 54</NUMEX> ] . The
          mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) pathway,
          consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase kinases</ENAMEX> (MKKs) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>, and
          extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>,
          which have been implicated in diverse cellular processes
          including proliferation, transformation, and cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) pathway
          has emerged as a crucial route between membrane-bound Ras
          and the nucleus. This MAPK pathway encompasses a cascade
          of phosphorylation events involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key kinases,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">namely Raf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase kinase</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERKs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, c-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (JNK), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX>. These signaling pathways in turn,
          activate a variety of transcription factors including
          NF-kappaB (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p50/p65</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 (c-Fos/c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jun</ENAMEX>), and CREB
          phosphorylation, which in turn coordinate the induction
          of many genes encoding inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>.
          Cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX>, and the
          interferons transmit their regulatory signals primarily
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of tyrosine
          kinases, and activate STAT transcription factors.
          Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT5 proteins</ENAMEX> are detected in reduced levels
          in lymphocytes recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Both of these types of receptor
          signaling pathways have recently been shown to interact
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine kinases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX>. A
          common intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> initiating from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to
          the nucleus is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK</ENAMEX> (MAPK) cascade, which
          can result in the phosphorylation and activation of
          additional downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX> and transcription factors
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p90Rsk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elk</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egr-1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] .
          Therefore, it is intriguing that Tat expressing cells
          show down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> components (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, Figure
          3Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3C</ENAMEX>), essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and
          nuclear transcription factors. This would imply that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latently</ENAMEX> infected cells that express <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (doubly spliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) and not the whole virus (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> classes of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>), can control signal transduction related to membrane
          and transcriptional signaling (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>, through the RGD motif, which
          controls integrin-based cell signaling, has been reported
          to mediate the activity of phosphotyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX>(s). This in turn which would lead to a
          decrease in the levels of phosphotyrosine-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK-2/p42MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
          Cysteine-rich and basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat peptides</ENAMEX> have been shown to
          inhibit VEGF-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation and mitogenesis.
          These peptides also inhibited proliferation,
          angiogenesis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation induced by basic
          fibroblast growth factor with similar potency and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, it has been
          shown that treatment of neural cells with culture
          supernatants from HAART-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, which
          presumably contain extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>, resulted in
          down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Finally, activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPKs</ENAMEX> has been shown to
          activate the singly spliced and unspliced (genomic)
          latent HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>. For instance, the signal transduction
          pathways that regulate the switch from latent to
          productive infection have been linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX>. The
          induction of latent HIV-1 expression has been shown to be
          inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059 and U0126</TIMEX>, specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> acts by stimulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 and a
          subsequent physical and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX>, resulting in a complex that synergistically
          transactivates the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . At the level of
          infection and entry, the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> through the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf/MEK</ENAMEX> (MAPK kinase) signaling pathway enhances the
          infectivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">virions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Virus infectivity</ENAMEX> can be
          enhanced by treatment of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> stimulators,
          such as serum and phorbol myristate acetate, as well as
          by coexpression of constitutively activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras, Raf</ENAMEX>, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEK</ENAMEX> in the absence of extracellular stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
          Also, following infection, efficient disengagement of the
          reverse transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX> and
          subsequent nuclear translocation, requires
          phosphorylation of the reverse transcription complex
          components by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK/MAPK</ENAMEX>; demonstrating a critical
          regulation of an early step in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infection by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cell MAPK signal transduction pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] .
          Therefore, Tat down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway in
          latent cells implies that much of the host signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transductions</ENAMEX> connected to activation are down-regulated,
          and at the same time, these cells may be refractory to
          subsequent infection by other viruses.
        
        
          Thymosin family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and cell cycle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prothymosin α</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX>) belongs to the α-Thymosin family
          which comprises different polypeptides widely distributed
          within animal tissues. Although its role has remained
          controversial, it is involved in the increase of
          immediate early <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as c-myc [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] , which is
          upstream of cyclin D synthesis and necessary for cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> is coded by a gene
          family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them contains introns,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> and classic regulatory signals, while the remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> are intronless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mRNA transcripts, which arise in a
          ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:1</TIMEX> (shorter/longer form), where only the long
          transcript is regulated by extracellular signals.
          It has been demonstrated that malignant tissues with
          accelerated cell cycle show higher levels of ProTα
          expression than normal or surrounding healthy tissues [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> ] . ProTα was shown as a marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>
          ] , hepatocarcinoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] , and plasma levels of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">derivative Tα</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> been proposed as a marker for the
          prognosis of lung cancer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] . In ligand blotting
          assays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> bound only to chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and nuclear
          fractions where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">histone H1</ENAMEX> was present [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72</NUMEX> ] . The
          analysis of the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ProTα with H1</ENAMEX>-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromatin</ENAMEX> suggests a putative role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> in the
          fine-tuning of the stoichiometry and/or mode of
          interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H1</TIMEX> with chromatin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly,
          HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> show an enhancement of
          accessibility of micrococcal nuclease to chromatin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implying</ENAMEX> relaxed chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for enhanced cell
          cycle gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] .
          A broad study using several mononuclear and
          fibroblastic cell lines has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> is cell cycle phase-dependent. In the U937
          monocytic cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProTα</ENAMEX> mRNA peaked at the end of S/G2
          phase and fell towards the entry into the new <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">G1</NUMEX> phase.
          More prominent mRNA regulation was found in the
          fibroblastic cell lines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CV1 and NIH3T3</TIMEX>, with peak mRNA
          levels at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX>. In all cases the expression
          pattern coincided with that of cyclin B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cdc2/cyclin</ENAMEX> B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] .
          It is interesting to note that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# X05360</NUMEX>),
          Cdc10 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homolog</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# S72008</NUMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc37</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc# U43077</NUMEX>) were
          all up-regulated in Tat expressing cells. Cdc2, a
          catalytic subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases, is
          required for both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G1</NUMEX>-to-S and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2-to-M</ENAMEX> transitions. In
          the fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe</ENAMEX>, the
          execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Start</ENAMEX> requires the activity of the Cdc2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc10/Sct1</ENAMEX> transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
          The loss of any of these genes leads to G1 arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Cdc37 encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that targets
          intrinsically unstable oncoprotein kinases including
          Cdk4, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Raf-1</ENAMEX>, and v-src to the molecular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chaperone Hsp90</TIMEX>,
          an interaction that is thought to be important for the
          establishment of signaling pathways. Cdc37 expression may
          not only be required to support proliferation in cells
          that are developmentally programmed to proliferate, but
          may also be required in cells that are inappropriately
          induced to initiate proliferation by oncogenes. For
          instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMTV-Cdc37</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop mammary
          gland tumors at a rate comparable to that observed
          previously in MMTV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cyclin</NUMEX> D1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, indicating that Cdc37
          can function as an oncogene in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and suggests that the
          establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase pathways mediated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc37-Hsp90</ENAMEX> can be a rate-limiting event in
          transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . Also, analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdk6 and Cdk4</TIMEX> has shown
          complexes containing both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp90</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc37</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 78 79</NUMEX> ]
          .
          Cdc37 also promotes the production of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cak1</TIMEX>. Cak1 in
          yeast is the human homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAK</ENAMEX> trimeric enzyme
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CDK7</ENAMEX>, cyclin H, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAT1</TIMEX>. Both human and yeast
          Caks function as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II CTD</ENAMEX> kinase, Cdk
          activating kinase, and DNA damage/repair enzymes. Cdc37,
          like its higher eukaryotic homologs, promotes the
          physical integrity of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>, perhaps
          by virtue of a cotranslational role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> folding [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ] . Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hsp90/Cdc37</ENAMEX> has recently been shown in
          the stabilization/folding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdk9</TIMEX> as well as the assembly
          of an active <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdk9/cyclin</ENAMEX> T1 complex responsible for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P-TEFb-mediated Tat transactivation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcription</ENAMEX> and chromatin remodeling
          factors
          A highly ordered chromatin structure presents a
          physical obstacle for gene transcription; presumably by
          limiting the access of transcription factors and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase II</ENAMEX> core machinery to target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 83</NUMEX> ] . In
          concert with the observation that corepressors are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAC</ENAMEX> activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84 85</NUMEX> ] , it appears
          that the transcriptional outcome of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is
          determined by the balance of histone acetylation and
          deacetylation activities, and that ligands serve as a
          switch to recruit HATs with the concomitant dismissal of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDACs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways add another layer of
          regulation to the functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300.</ENAMEX> In the case of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POU</ENAMEX> homeodomain factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pit-1</ENAMEX>, transcriptional
          activity is potentiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> ] .
          Therefore, down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>
          expressing cells, as seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, is consistent with
          decreased phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding factors such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pit-1</ENAMEX>, and overall lower DNA binding activity. Here, we
          describe the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coactivator proteins SRC-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acc#</ENAMEX>
          AJ000882, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U90661</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p300</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acc# U01877</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), and their relation to differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as
          retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR/PML</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acc#</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X06614</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Leptin receptor variant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Acc#</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U66496</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>); all
          of which are down-regulated in Tat expressing cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX> a great deal of evidence
          has accumulated in favor of the hypothesis that steroid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor hormones</ENAMEX> act via regulation of gene expression.
          The action is mediated by specific nuclear receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which belong to a superfamily of
          ligand-modulated transcription factors that regulate
          homeostasis, reproduction, development, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> ] . This family includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX>, thyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, hormonal forms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin A</ENAMEX> and D, peroxisomal activators, and ecdysone [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> ] . Nuclear hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are ligand-dependent
          transcription factors that regulate genes critical to
          such biological processes as development, reproduction,
          and homeostasis. Interestingly, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can
          function as molecular switches, alternating between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of transcriptional repression and activation,
          depending on the absence or presence of a cognate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX>, respectively. In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cognate hormone</ENAMEX>,
          several nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> actively repress transcription
          of target genes via interactions with the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor corepressors SMRT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCoR</ENAMEX>. Upon binding of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX>, these corepressors dissociate from the DNA-bound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, which subsequently recruits a nuclear receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coactivator</ENAMEX> (NCoA) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Prominent among these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coactivators</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid receptor coactivator</ENAMEX>)
          family, which consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRC-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TIF2/GRIP1</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RAC3/ACTR/pCIP/AIB-1</ENAMEX>. These cofactors interact with
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in a ligand-dependent manner and
          enhance transcriptional activation via histone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acetylation/methylation</ENAMEX> and recruitment of additional
          cofactors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> has been
          implicated in the functions of a large number of
          regulated transcription factors based primarily on
          physical interaction and the ability to potentiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> when overexpressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> ] . In the case of
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/p300</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ligand-dependent</ENAMEX> and relies on the conserved nuclear
          receptor functional domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AF-2</ENAMEX> (activation function <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          
          In vivo studies have supported the
          conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> are components of the
          hormonal-regulation of transcription in fibroblasts
          isolated from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p300-/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>; and loss of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p300</NUMEX> gene
          severely affects <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>)-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> ] . In a separate study using
          hammerhead ribozymes that specifically cleave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> or p300
          mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kawasaki et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92</TIMEX> ] reported that reduced
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">CBP</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p300</TIMEX> levels resulted in compromised
          expression of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>-inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p21/Waf1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 cdk inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Along this line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX>
          expressing cells have lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p21/Waf1</ENAMEX> presumably
          due to inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p300/RA</ENAMEX>- induced
          gene expression. Consistent with this interpretation, CBP
          and p300 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> transcriptional activation of
          ligand-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> function on a chromatinized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NcoA</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> constitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SRC-1/NcoA-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ]
          , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TIF2/GRIP1/NcoA-2</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94 95</NUMEX> ] and pCIP<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/ACTR/AIB1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96 97</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which interact with liganded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX>. Overexpression of these NCoA factors
          enhances ligand-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transactivation</ENAMEX> of several
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] . A weak intrinsic HAT activity
          has been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SRC-1/NCoA-1</ENAMEX> and pCIP<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ACTR/AIB1,</ENAMEX>
          suggesting that chromatin remodeling may also be a
          function of these NCoA factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 100</NUMEX> ] ; although they
          do not appear to contain regions homologous to the HAT
          domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p/CAF</ENAMEX>. Structure-function analysis
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCoAs</ENAMEX> have revealed multiple copies of a signature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXXLL</ENAMEX>, with conserved spacing that is required for
          interaction with nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBP/p300</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 101</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, different LXXLL motifs are required for

          ligands, suggesting distinct configuration of assembled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Taken together, through the use of microarray
          technology, we have described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the first
          observations about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> is able to control various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">machineries</ENAMEX>. Although our data is
          consistent with most of the cited literature on the
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> in infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and uninfected bystander
          cells, we caution that the transcriptional profiling in
          chronically infected cells such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACH2</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H9/Tat cells</ENAMEX>
          may not necessarily be representative of the pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> observed in most cells infected by other group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">O HIV-1</ENAMEX> isolates.
          We recently extended our observations by utilizing
          other HIV-1 infected cells which normally express Tat
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U1</NUMEX>), and addition of exogenous purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uninfected PBMCs</ENAMEX>. Preliminary results using western blots
          supports the idea that genes which were altered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H9/Tat</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> also showed a similar level of change in few of
          the tested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). This notion of consistency
          was further confirmed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>.
          Interleukin-8 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>) belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXC</ENAMEX> chemokine family
          and is secreted by several different cell types,
          including monocytes, neutrophils, endothelial cells,
          fibroblasts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> production (induced
          by several stimuli, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>, TNF-, and phorbol
          myristate acetate) is primarily regulated at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> is a potent chemotactic
          factor for granulocytes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes, and is found
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXC chemokine IL-8</ENAMEX> does
          not bind to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>. It has previously been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>
          mRNA induction was seen less then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 h</NUMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72aa</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX>, and levels remained elevated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 24</TIMEX> h,
          leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-8 protein</ENAMEX> production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">102</ENAMEX> ] . Along these
          lines, we have previously shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> gene is
          expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner in cells that
          express the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX>, and the induction is during the
          S phase of the cell cycle and regulated by stable NF-kB
          binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ] . When looking for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> border, we found that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat</ENAMEX> containing
          cells, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> that were treated with exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> showed an up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-8</ENAMEX> in the supernatant
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), further implying that results obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H9/Tat</ENAMEX> system may infact be of general physiological
          relevance in vivo.
          Finally, throughout the current study we came across
          some technical findings that were critical in the
          confirmation of most of our results. For instance, few
          genes did not correlate in their activation or
          suppression levels when comparing fold changes between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels using western blot
          analysis. We suspect this is because many genes that are
          transcribed may not necessarily be translated, due to
          their cell cycle stage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' stem and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">loop RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>,
          varying half-lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and mRNAs, and a host of
          other unknown variables. Also, specific changes that
          occur in a cell may not be required in redundant pathways
          that score for a specific function. This is commonly seen
          in the differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected or Tat
          expressing 
          in vitro cell lines and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> PBMC samples. Therefore, other microarrays would
          have to be performed on purified infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PBMCs</ENAMEX> to
          confirm most of the changes observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tables 1, 2</ENAMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Unfortunately, to date this particular issue is not
          feasibly addressable, since it is not possible to isolate
          a homogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX> or Monocytic cells
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Also, confirmatory tests for protein
          expression would have to be done with both hydrophilic
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> extraction buffers. For instance, we have
          observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is up-regulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tat</ENAMEX>
          expressing cells, extract best with hydrophobic buffers
          from the nucleus, presumably due to its binding to DNA
          replication machinery (data not shown). Future
          experiments will address issues related to differences
          between various HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> clades, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> expression levels
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T- and Monocytic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, and its effect at various
          stages of the cell cycle.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Expression profiling from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> or Tat expressing cells
        holds great promise for rapid functional analysis. Here, we
        have described the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX> and its alterations with
        the host cellular gene expression. We observed that more
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">than 2/3</NUMEX> of the cellular genes tested were down-regulated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. These genes belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, co-receptor, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-activator pathways that are part of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor tyrosine kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK</ENAMEX> (MAPK) cascade,
        which control proliferative and/or differentiation signals.
        We also observed a great deal of increase in the host cell
        translation apparatus with the possible aim of optimizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viral mRNA</ENAMEX> translation prior to viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturation</ENAMEX> and
        release. Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> accessory doubly spliced messages
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>, may control the host gene expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latently</ENAMEX> infected cells, and determine not only viral
        transcription, but also the fate of post-transcriptional
        events.
      
      
        Materials and method
        
          Cell culture
          ACH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infected CD4
          lymphocytic cells, with an integrated wild-type
          single-copy chromatinized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEM T</ENAMEX> cell (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12D7</NUMEX>) is
          the parental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> for ACH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. ACH2 cell lines has a single
          copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LAI strain proviral sequence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> has a point
          mutation at (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C37 -> T</ENAMEX>), which no longer responds
          (efficiently) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX>. However, the cell line is fully
          capable of making infectious virus in presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>, and a host of other stimuli. H9 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H9/Tat</ENAMEX>
          cells are both CD4+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphocytic</ENAMEX> cells, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H9</NUMEX> cells
          carry a control integrated vector without the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tat</ENAMEX> open
          reading frame, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H9/Tat</ENAMEX> cells carry integrated Tat
          expression vector. Both cell lines were a generous gift
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pavlakis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>). U1 is a monocytic clone
          harboring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> from parental
          U973 cells. All cells were cultured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37°C up to 10</NUMEX>
          5cells per ml in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPMI-1640</ENAMEX> media, containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> Fetal

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-glutamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco/BRL</ENAMEX>). Phytohemagglutinin-activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were kept in culture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> prior to addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tat protein</ENAMEX>. Isolation and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were
          performed by following the guidelines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease Control</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 5 ×</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 6PBMC</TIMEX> were used for

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. After an initial incubation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hr with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tat</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, cells were washed and cultured in complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hrs, prior to western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX>. pCEP4, eTat
          cells were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells stably transfected with either a
          backbone control plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pCEP4; Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) or a plasmid
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-86</ENAMEX>) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal epitope tag
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eTat</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ] . HeLa cell lines containing either the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> or eTat plasmid were selected by single-cell
          dilution. Both cell types were selected and maintained
          under <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 μg</NUMEX> of hygromycin per ml. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verification of Tat</ENAMEX>
          transcriptional activity was achieved by electroporation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmids as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Cell cycle analysis
          Hela cells were blocked with hydroxyurea (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mM</NUMEX>)
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> Following the block, cells were released by
          being washed twice with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">phosphate-buffered</NUMEX> saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>)
          and by the addition of complete medium. All suspension
          cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> serum for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hrs prior to
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>. Supernatants were collected and analyzed
          by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8 ELISA</ENAMEX> according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosource International</ENAMEX>). For controls,
          each sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 6cells</TIMEX> was processed
          for cell sorting. Cells were washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and fixed by
          addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 μl</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. For
          fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis,
          cells were stained with a cocktail of propidium iodide
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>) buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ca2</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Mg2</NUMEX>+, RNase A [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> μg/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>],

          software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verity Software House, Inc.</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell extract preparation and immunoblotting
          All cells were cultured to mid-log phase of growth,
