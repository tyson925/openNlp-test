        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonadherence</ENAMEX> to drug therapy can undermine the
        attainment of therapeutic goals and contribute to the
        occurrence of medication side effects. Numerous adverse
        clinical outcomes have been linked to nonadherence
        including loss of blood pressure control [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , acute
        cardiac events [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , renal transplant rejection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ,
        seizures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Human Immunodeficiency Virus</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Efforts to enhance medicinal adherence
        have met with varying levels of success [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The detection of nonadherence to recommended treatment
        can be problematic. In the clinical setting asking patients
        about their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use is the most practical means of
        ascertainment, but it is prone to inaccuracy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Strategies to increase the accuracy of screening for
        nonadherence such as considering as nonadherent all those
        who do not respond to therapy can augment sensitivity.
        However, this unfairly mislabels some adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonadherent</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> tend to
        overestimate their adherence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] and unless a patient
        is not responding to therapy, it may be extremely difficult
        to identify under-adherence. In research settings, pill
        counts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> levels, pharmacy dispensing records and
        electronic medication monitors are available to measure
        medicinal adherence but even some of these methods such as
        pill counts may be susceptible to overestimating adherence
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 13 14 15</ENAMEX> ] . In many non-research situations these
        approaches may be difficult to implement due to their
        obtrusiveness, cost, or complexity.
        Although studies have been conducted to identify risk
        factors for nonadherence itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , to the best of our
        knowledge, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> previous study has examined possible
        risk factors for 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adherence</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        None has utilized electronic medication monitors to study
        this area involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihypertensive medications</ENAMEX>. We
        consequently undertook this present study among several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hundred individuals</ENAMEX> who were receiving antihypertensive
        therapy in order to explore which demographic, behavioral,
        and clinical characteristics might be associated with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of adherence. The investigation was
        exploratory in nature and was meant to identify possible
        leads for future research. Electronic medication monitors
        were used to track actual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use against which the
        accuracy of patient-reported adherence was determined.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          The study design of this investigation has been
          described previously in detail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, the
          study was conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Pilgrim Health Care</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPHC</ENAMEX>), a managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who were receiving
          antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 to 1994</TIMEX>. Automated
          medical, pharmacy, and claims records of the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were screened to identify potential study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and retrieve their outpatient blood pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were eligible if they had been HPHC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three months</TIMEX>, were at least 18 years
          of age, and carried a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>. Only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on single-drug therapy for high blood
          pressure were selected to simplify electronic adherence
          monitoring.
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,285</NUMEX> potentially eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX>
          consented to participate and completed all phases of the
          study. The majority of those who did not enroll in the
          study (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) declined mailed or telephone invitations to
          participate. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> dropped out midway
          through the study, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were later excluded
          because of indications of improper use of their
          electronic medication monitor such as removal of multiple
          doses at an opening or incomplete closure of the
          medication vial. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">286</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> constituted
          the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for this investigation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX>
          who were eligible but did not complete this investigation
          had a similar age, gender, and blood pressure
          distribution as our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. However, calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were prescribed slightly more frequently (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>
          versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) and angiotensin-converting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> less
          frequently (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> excluded from
          the final study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Collection of electronic and patient-reported
          adherence data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who consented to participate were mailed a
          baseline questionnaire that covered their socioeconomic
          background, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (antihypertensive and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>), adherence, health beliefs, health status (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outcomes Study</ENAMEX>, Short Form [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , and social
          support. Responses to the questionnaire were obtained by
          telephone interview conducted by a research
          assistant.
          Self-reported adherence during the monitoring period
          was obtained using the following question, which was
          adapted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brief Medication Questionnaire</ENAMEX> (Svarstad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.</ENAMEX>, personal communication): 
          While you were using the special
          medication bottle, on how many days in an AVERAGE WEEK
          did you forget to take a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>+
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Our previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] had indicated that
          responses to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> (compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> other adherence
          items) correlated most closely with adherence as measured
          by electronic medication monitoring.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> support was assessed using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-item inventory.
          The inventory inquired about how often the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>
          could rely on having someone to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) listen to them, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          accompany them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) show affection to
          them, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) give them information, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) provide them with
          advice that they would want, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) do things with them to
          turn their minds to other things, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) help with chores,
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) share worries and fears with, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) do enjoyable
          things with. Responses to each question were recorded on
          a Likert scale (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>=none, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=a little, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>=most, or
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>=all of the time).
          Electronic monitoring vials were dispensed with a
          fresh supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihypertensive medication</ENAMEX> upon
          enrollment in the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were instructed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacists</ENAMEX> to keep all their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> in the
          monitoring vial, use no other source of antihypertensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, and to remove <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> dose at a time from
          the monitoring vial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were informed of the
          purpose of the electronic medication monitor.
          Dosing events were recorded for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Medication Event Monitoring System</ENAMEX>-4
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEMS-4</ENAMEX>), manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APREX Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union City</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CA.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEMS-4</ENAMEX> is a microelectronic device housed within a
          medication bottle cap that records <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the date</TIMEX> and time of
          each opening. The device blocks repeated openings that
          occur within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> of each other to prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artifactual</ENAMEX> inflation of the number of dosing events.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were downloaded from the cap to a personal computer
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>-supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">communicator</ENAMEX> and
          software.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two to three weeks</TIMEX> after completion of electronic
          monitoring, a followup questionnaire was sent to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to update information on their socioeconomic
          status, prescribed antihypertensive therapy,
          self-reported adherence during the monitoring period, and
          health beliefs. Responses were once again obtained by
          telephone. All aspects of the study protocol were
          reviewed and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Studies Committee of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Pilgrim Health Care</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Due to the highly skewed distribution of questionnaire
          responses (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4.5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reported missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">doses 2</ENAMEX> or more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>), the average number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days in a week</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> missed a dose of
          antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> was dichotomized at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> versus
          â‰<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">¥1 day</TIMEX> per week. Setting the breakpoint between adherent
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonadherent days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> per week represents a
          frequency of missed-dose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/7</NUMEX>). MEMS-4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> were used to derive the actual frequency of days
          when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or more doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihypertensive medication</ENAMEX> were
          omitted. Adherence was defined to be over-estimated by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> if they reported an average frequency of
          nonadherence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> (i.e. <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.3%</NUMEX>) while
          electronic monitoring indicated a higher frequency of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with missed doses (i.e. â‰<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">¥14</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.3%</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis proceeded from an assessment of crude
          (unadjusted) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> to step-wise logistic regression to identify
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> remained after adjustment for other
          potential risk factors. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> categories of variables were
          considered: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) socioeconomic and demographic background
          (age, gender, education, marital status, employment,
          income); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) clinical features (blood pressure, duration
          of treatment, number of doses per day); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) clinician
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> (previous inquiry by clinician regarding
          medicinal adherence) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) health beliefs (perceived
          effectiveness of treatment and susceptibility to adverse
          health outcomes); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) health status (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 indices); and
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) social support (a summary score derived from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-item support inventory). These variables were chosen
          either because their information might be obtainable or
          inferred by practicing clinicians, or they had been
          evaluated in previous studies of adherence behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> or likelihood ratio tests from
          logistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX> were used to evaluate crude
          associations between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting and possible
          predictor variables. In executing the stepwise logistic
          regression procedure, a selection criterion of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â‰¤ .2</ENAMEX> was selected to allow for
          the evaluation of the joint effect of multiple variables.
          The rejection criterion was also set relatively high at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â‰¥ .1</ENAMEX> to permit identification of
          all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX>. As described later in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, all
          variables that were ultimately retained in the final
          logistic regression model amply met these retention
          criteria. All data manipulations and statistical analyses
          were conducted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.12</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">286</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        whose mean age was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years</TIMEX> (range: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-84 years</TIMEX>). As listed
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> were female, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> had some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> level
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. The mean (Â± standard deviation) systolic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140.0</NUMEX>(Â±
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.1</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">/86.3(Â± 10.4</NUMEX>). Angiotensin converting enzyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were the most commonly prescribed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antihypertensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX>) followed by calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>), diuretics (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>), beta blockers (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>),
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>). The median duration of
        antihypertensive therapy prior to involvement in the study
        was slightly greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>.
        Average nonadherence was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who

        compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who reported more
        frequent nonadherence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> correlation between
        reported and electronically measured adherence was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.34</NUMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0001</NUMEX>). While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 21%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> acknowledged missing doses one or more days
        per week, electronic medication monitoring documented
        nonadherence at this or greater levels in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.025</NUMEX>) in that order. Lower mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> prior to participation
        in the study was initially selected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>) but not
        retained in the final regression model. Marital status was
        not chosen by the step-wise procedure. Age, gender, and
        race/ethnicity also were not associated (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>.05</NUMEX>) with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> and step-wise logistic
        regression analyses. Including all variables with crude
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ .1</NUMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of adherence
        (marital status, income, mean diastolic blood pressure in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>, number of daily doses, and perceived
        risk) in a single logistic regression model did not
        materially affect our findings (results not shown). The
        link <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between >1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose and over-reporting of
        adherence was blocked (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.38</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.73</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.64</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>) by adjusting for actual
        adherence as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEMS-4</ENAMEX> in the final, selected
        model indicating that the association between dosing
        frequency and over-reporting was most likely mediated by
        actual adherence.
      
      
        Discussion
        The main purpose of this exploratory analysis was to
        identify potential risk factors for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX>. We observed that frequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dosing</ENAMEX>, reduced
        risk perception from nonadherence, and lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income
        were associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting in our study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly, less adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        were also more likely to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-report their adherence than
        other more adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, a pattern that has been
        reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        The exploratory nature of this investigation makes
        cautious interpretation of our findings necessary. Multiple
        comparisons were made in this study and consequently the
        results may have been chance findings. Use of a very
        conservative standard of significance based on the
        Bonferroni adjustment would require a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of â‰¤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.002</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05/23</NUMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX> represents the traditional standard of
        significance and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> the number of comparisons made). By
        these criteria, only dosing frequency would still be
        considered statistically significant.
        The association between dosing frequency and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of adherence was apparently mediated by
        actual adherence behavior because adjusting statistically
        for electronically measured adherence blocked this
        relationship. This is not surprising because frequent
        dosing usually predicts lower adherence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] and lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting. As a
        consequence, frequent dosing would be expected to correlate
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting via its connection with actual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX>.
        On a more conjectural level, the observed connection
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> decreased perception of health risk from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonadherence</ENAMEX> and over-reporting of adherence may indicate
        that health belief models that posit a direct relationship
        between perceived risk and adherence may also apply to the
        accurate recollection of past <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX>
        ] . In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with lower household
        income in our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> may indicate that a more
        stressful if not disorganized life situation, as suggested
        by lower socioeconomic status, may increase the likelihood
        of inaccurately believing that missed doses were taken.
        Furthermore, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may report what they believe
        that clinicians or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> want to hear. This behavior
        might be more likely when the perceived difference in power
        (as measured by wealth and income) is maximal.
        Several factors that may contribute to the inaccurate
        recounting of adherence by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were not evaluated in
        this study. The research instruments did not cover
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' attitudes towards the healthcare system,
        their healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, or the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> involved
        in this study. The quality of the patient-physician (and by
        extension the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant-researcher</ENAMEX>) relationship may have
        a significant impact on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will discuss with
        their healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, formal
        psychological and cognitive testing were not performed on
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to permit evaluation of the effect of
        memory, judgement, mood, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> on adherence and
        the accurate reporting of noncompliance.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This investigation is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to evaluate
        possible risk factors for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-reporting of adherence by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The findings suggest that factors related to
        socioeconomic status, the dosing regimen, and perceived
        risk from nonadherence may influence how accurately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recall and report their adherence. Additional
        investigation will be needed to confirm and extend these
        findings as well as elucidate the possible underlying
        behavioral mechanisms that are involved.
