        Recent work has shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> regulates
        mitochondrial homeostasis during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bax, Bak</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bim</ENAMEX>,
        promote the release of death-inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as
        cytochrome c [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , smac [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and endonuclease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] , from mitochondria while <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bcl-2 and Bcl-X</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> , inhibit this release. Following
        release into the cytosol, these death-inducing proteins
        promote apoptotic cell destruction through multiple
        pathways including caspase activation and nuclear DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to controlling the release of pro-death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> also alters the function of
        mitochondria undergoing apoptosis. Dysfunction of voltage
        dependent anion channel opening, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP/ATP exchange</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, oxidative phosphorylation, and
        calcium buffering through the action of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . While early defects
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> can be reversed by addition
        of exogenous cytochrome c, the damage eventually becomes
        refractory to cytochrome c addition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This finding
        suggests that pro-death <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can damage
        mitochondrial function independent of cytochrome c
        loss.
        Recently, we demonstrated that the targeting of the
        pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tBid to mitochondria depends upon the
        presence of the mitochondria-specific lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cardiolipin</ENAMEX> in
        a possibly unique structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiolipin</ENAMEX> has a
        defined distribution pattern within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mitochondria</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        It is found in high concentrations throughout the inner
        membrane, including at contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and outer membrane interact. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiolipin</ENAMEX> is
        present at much lower concentrations elsewhere in the outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. This distinction suggests that tBid might
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localize</ENAMEX> to contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> because of the arrangement of
        cardiolipin there. To test this hypothesis, we determined
        the submitochondrial localization of tBid using a new
        hybrid technique - immunoelectron tomography, which couples
        conventional immunoelectron microscopy with tomography to
        add the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> dimension. Tomographic analysis was chosen
        because it enables quantitative three-dimensional
        examination of fine structure within the relevant
        mitochondrial domains in semi-thick sections and thereby
        facilitates accurate representation of the sometimes
        complex membrane topology of this organelle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Immunoelectron tomography is ideal for testing the
        independence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of labels, or label and
        structural component (as employed in this study), and their
        deviation from independence - colocalization or mutual
        inhibition - because it allows true 3-D distances to be
        measured. We report here an analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-D</NUMEX> distances
        of immunogold-labeled tBid from contact sites on the
        periphery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver mitochondria</ENAMEX> that strongly supports the
        colocalization of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        Initially, we used wild type (WT) tBid that was
        myc-tagged for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunogold electron microscopy</ENAMEX> in our
        investigation of its localization along the mitochondrial
        periphery. Generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid was observed to be in close
        proximity to contact sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, the
        preservation of the outer membrane of isolated mouse liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> treated with this tBid was less than optimal
        for testing the hypothesis of tBid association with contact
        sites. A significant portion of the outer membrane was
        absent in most mitochondria observed, which may have been
        caused in part by the activity of this pro-apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in releasing cytochrome c from the region between
        the outer and inner membranes. Neither was the gold
        labeling very high, most likely because a stripped outer
        membrane results in considerably fewer contact sites.
        Another pitfall was the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-nm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> (as opposed to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-nm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>) particles, which resulted in streaks that
        sometimes obscured the peripheral membranes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Even
        though harder to see in the microscope, for our analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> tBid labeling, we resorted to the smaller-sized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, which greatly diminished the artifactual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">streaking</ENAMEX>.
        To enhance mitochondrial membrane preservation, a point
        mutation changing the glycine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> to
        glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BH3</TIMEX> domain of tBid was used. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> was previously shown to lower the cytochrome c
        releasing activity of tBid without affecting its targeting
        to mitochondria [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mitochondria</ENAMEX> treated with tBid 
        G94E displayed better preservation of
        the outer membrane than those treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid. Hence,
        because of better preservation of contact sites, the tBid 
        G94E was used primarily for the
        tomographic analysis. For immunogold labeling, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-myc
        tag was placed at residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> of Bid 
        G94E . Following cleavage by caspase <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
        a version of tBid 
        G94E was generated with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-myc
        tag at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of tBid 
        G94E . Monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-myc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was
        used for immunogold labeling to ensure high specificity of
        binding.
        Before performing the time-expensive tomography,
        analysis of thin sections with conventional electron
        microscopy was used to judge the immunogold labeling
        quality. As expected, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold particles</ENAMEX> per
        mitochondrion varied. However, most had several particles
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrayed</ENAMEX> along the perimeter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To confirm the
        specificity of labeling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> controls were analyzed by
        thin-section microscopy. Neither the no-primary control
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) nor the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> control, consisting of replacing
        the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with an excess of tBid 
        G94E (data not shown), showed any gold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> control was the presence of a
        contaminant organelle, peroxisomes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>); no gold
        particles were observed attached to them. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>
        controls for labeling specificity indicated that the
        non-specific immunogold background was very low. Further,
        on those mitochondrial surfaces where the outer membrane
        was inadvertently stripped off during the specimen
        processing, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> was observed, which is to be expected
        as there is no contact site where there is no outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> tomography has several advantages over
        conventional two-dimensional immunogold electron microscopy
        that should be enumerated to understand the accuracy of the
        measurements made in this study. First, a more accurate
        localization of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-nm</NUMEX> gold particles is possible because
        each slice of the tomographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> nm
        in thickness compared with the typical <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-100 nm</NUMEX> thickness
        used in conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immuno-electron microscopy</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        because the dimensions of contact sites (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~14</NUMEX> nm diameter) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] are considerably smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-100</NUMEX> nm, they are
        easily missed in conventional microscopy; this problem was
        removed by the typically finer sampling of electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomography</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2 nm</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, because tomography is inherently
        a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-D</NUMEX> tool, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3-D</TIMEX> placement of gold-labeled tBid 
        G94E was obtained in relation to the 3-D
        distribution of contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and gold beads at high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>. Unlike two-dimensional electron micrographs,
        true Euclidean distance was measured at a resolution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX> (twice the pixel size, or thickness, according to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX> sampling theory) in tomographic reconstructions
        from each gold bead to the nearest contact site. These
        measurements were then used for a statistical analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomographic reconstruction</ENAMEX> of immunogold-labeled
        semi-thick sections confirmed the preferential association
        of tBid with contact sites. Figure 3highlights features of
        a tomographic reconstruction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the tBid 
        G94E -labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver mitochondrion</ENAMEX> used
        in the statistical analysis. The mitochondrial volume
        sliced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">perpendicular planes</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles
        can be seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> faces (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a, arrowheads)
        emphasizes the vast 3-D information available with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomography</ENAMEX>. Individual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-nm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">slices</ENAMEX> illustrate how gold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> and contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be easily identified with
        this hybrid, high-resolution technique (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insets</ENAMEX> in figure 3bshow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> particles near
        contact sites. Graphic representations of a segmented
        volume are shown in figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3c</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Segmentation</ENAMEX> is a visual
        tool that defines and dissects volumes and thus aids the
        interpretation and measurement of structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interrelationships</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Once segmented, volumes were
        surface-rendered. With the surface-rendered volume, the
        various components of interest can be oriented to best
        study the proximity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and contact sites in relation
        to the membrane topology. A wealth of information can be
        quickly taken in by rotating the segmented volumes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://ncmir.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsd</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/~perkins/tBid.</ENAMEX> For example, it became
        apparent that contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be clustered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c,
        right-hand side of mitochondrion).
        We tested the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of tBid with contact sites by
        employing the statistics of spatial point patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        We measured the distances between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-D</NUMEX> loci of all
        contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and immunogold particles in the tomographic
        reconstructions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid and tBid 
        G94E labeled mitochondria. The closest
        contact site to each particle was calculated in Euclidean
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3-D</NUMEX>) space. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> a comparison of experimental
        "nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>" with nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> expected from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. The experimental mean value
        for nearest contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was significantly less than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> mean value for all mitochondria. We conducted a
        Student's t-test to test the null hypothesis that the
        experimental mean values would be reasonably likely to be
        obtained from sampling randomly. The probability of this
        test for "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>" was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.7 x 10 -6and</NUMEX> was even lower for
        the other samples. Thus, at essentially any significance
        level, the null hypothesis is rejected and we conclude that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of tBid with contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is not random.
        For an understanding of what constitutes "close
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>" of gold particle with contact site, it is
        important to consider that the finite size of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunoglobulin</ENAMEX> molecules is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8-10</NUMEX> nm in the most
        extended <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> immunoglobulin molecules were used for
        the labeling (primary and secondary antibodies). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tBid</ENAMEX> and
        the myc-tag have molecular weights of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~22 kD and ~67 kD</NUMEX>,
        respectively. Hence, myc-tagged tBid has a size of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~5 nm</NUMEX>.
        The maximal size of the tBid-immunogold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is thus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> nm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-nm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nm). Hence the
        distance between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and contact site is not expected to
        be much less than this value. With this understanding, one
        can see that experimental means of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23-31</NUMEX> nm, shown in table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, are reasonable values for specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of tBid
        with contact sites. This is especially true upon comparing
        with the mean distances of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70-129</NUMEX> nm from the random
        placement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. Thus, this nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> statistic
        provides strong evidence that tBid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with
        mitochondrial contact sites.
      
      
        Discussion
        Mitochondria are compartmentalized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spaces by
        their inner and outer membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The outer membrane
        surrounds the mitochondria and separates it from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosol</ENAMEX>. The inner and outer membranes unite to form
        mitochondrial contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein composition</ENAMEX> that
        is still being defined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . It is important to test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of tBid with contact sites using electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> because whereas purification schemes are based
        on assumptions about what contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should contain (and
        sometimes arrived at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>), these sites
        have always been defined structurally. As previously noted,
        contact sites are purported to have a unique lipid
        environment that is rich in cardiolipin. The presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiolipin</ENAMEX> has been implicated in the function of numerous
        mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including, sites I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, the adenine nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transporter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> translocation machinery, and the
        localization of mitochondrial creatine kinase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX>
        ] .
        tBid 
        G94E was used predominantly for testing
        the hypothesis of localization of tBid to contact sites.
        Although this mutant translocates to mitochondria as
        efficiently as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> with diminished disruptive
        effect on the outer membrane, it seems conceivable that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">tBid</ENAMEX> harbors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct signals, one for translocation to
        mitochondria, and the other for interaction with proteins
        or lipids to exert its pro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">apoptotic</NUMEX> function. Disruption
        of this latter signal via mutation might alter tBid's
        submitochondrial localization, while preserving the outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. We showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid was not randomly localized
        with respect to contact sites. The mean experimental
        distance between gold particles and contact sites (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 nm</NUMEX>;
        see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), though, was significantly higher than those
        values for tBid 
        G94E (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23-31</NUMEX> nm; table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This increased
        distance for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid is likely due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors that
        affect the visualization of contact sites. First, tBid may
        have degraded the outer membrane, so that the nearest
        contact site is not always recognized as such. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
        streaking caused by reconstructing the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-nm</NUMEX> gold particles
        used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid labeling may have obscured the nearest
        contact site in a few instances. Hence, whereas our
        analysis cannot disprove the hypothesis that by mutating
        tBid its submitochondrial localization was changed, it
        seems more likely that the greater value for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> tBid is
        caused by the factors mentioned above. Thus, it appears
        that the conclusion of tBid localization to contact sites
        can be applied more generally than the narrow
        interpretation of tBid 
        G94E localization only.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truncated Bid</ENAMEX>, as other BH3-only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, requires
        another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bax</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bak</ENAMEX> to exert its
        pro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">apoptotic</NUMEX> function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, tBid was
        found associated with mitochondrial contact sites (Figs.
        1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and was shown to destabilize lipid membranes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> (along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bax</ENAMEX>) by increasing the permeabilization
        of artificial liposomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . Therefore it is
        possible that tBid can bind to the cardiolipin rich contact
        site membranes and destabilize them by inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bax</ENAMEX> or Bak
        to oligomerize. The membrane destabilization may cause a
        secondary effect of inhibiting the action of the proteins
        located there. This hypothesis would account for how tBid
        affects the function of many different processes without
        binding directly to several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Indeed it was found
        that the targeting of tBid to mitochondria-like membranes
        occurs in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, yet depends upon
        cardiolipin being in a possibly unique structure as opposed
        to free cardiolipin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The requirement for a specific
        cardiolipin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that is likely defined by the contact
        site is consistent with our observation that no gold
        particles were found in regions stripped of the outer
        membrane exposing the cardiolipin-rich inner membrane.
        After the induction of apoptosis, mitochondria display
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct phases of damage. Early in the process the
        outer membrane becomes permeable, without rupture (Although
        this is controversial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .), to several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found
        in the mitochondrial inner membrane space including
        cytochrome c, in which contact sites have a probable role [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] . During this early phase, though, the inner membrane
        remains intact and mitochondria still retain their protein
        import machinery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Later in the process there is
        swelling and herniation of the matrix leading to a
        distension of the cristae [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 30</ENAMEX> ] .
        Many factors could contribute to the structural changes
        observed in mitochondria. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tBid</ENAMEX> and other pro-death proteins
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bax</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bak</ENAMEX> could destabilize the membrane leading
        to the observed changes. Additionally loss of contact site
        and inner membrane integrity could indirectly cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and lead to the flow of water
        into the matrix. The loss of cytochrome c causes a break in
        the electron transfer chain resulting in the production of
        reactive oxygen species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Reactive oxygen species
        are known to cause the oxidation and loss of function of
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX> including cardiolipin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Finally,
        caspases activated downstream of cytochrome c release have
        been implicated in mitochondrial damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . It appears
        likely that the cumulative damage of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> could
        lead to the irreversible loss of mitochondrial membrane
        integrity and structure.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, we have combined the techniques of
        immunogold microscopy and electron tomography to determine
        visually and by statistical analysis that tBid is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preferentially</ENAMEX> concentrated at contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> rather than
        being randomly distributed along the outer membrane. For
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, immunogold electron tomography permitted a
        quantitative demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3-D organellar protein</ENAMEX>
        labeling with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. The method described is
        envisioned to broaden biological applications of
        ultrastructural immunogold labeling techniques especially
        in investigations dealing with compartmentalization of
        functional elements. For example, many organelles,
        including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apparatus</ENAMEX>, have a complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with a unique
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX>. Immunoelectron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomography</ENAMEX> is starting to be a useful tool in determining
        how the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may provide clues as to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> or scope of action [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ft. Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>).
          Mitochondria were centrifuged and the pellet was kept
          intact for all remaining steps. The mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX>
          were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 x 4 min</NUMEX> in cacodylate
          buffer. The mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          osmium tetroxide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron Microscopy Sciences</ENAMEX>) in
          cacodylate buffer for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, followed by

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pellets</ENAMEX> were dehydrated using a successive ethanol series
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 50, 70</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> in double distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> each on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were further dehydrated at
          room temperature <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 x</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 min and 2 x</ENAMEX> in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellets</ENAMEX> were transferred to glass scintillation vials
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durcupan ACM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX>) infiltration. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX>
          were <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> incubated in a sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70% ethanol/30%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% ethanol/50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% ethanol/70%</NUMEX> resin
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min each</TIMEX> at room temperature. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellets</ENAMEX> were then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">infiltrated 3 x 1</ENAMEX> hr in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>. After the
          final incubation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>-infiltrated pellet plus
          excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> were poured into aluminum dishes and
          polymerized at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hr.</TIMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy and tomographic
          reconstructions
          Tomographic reconstructions were performed as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, thin-sectioned
          material (~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80-nm</NUMEX> thick) was examined using a JEOL 1200FX
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscope. Thick-sectioned material was
          examined with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4000EX</ENAMEX> microscope operating at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keV</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.75 Î¼m</NUMEX> thick sections were tilted through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120Â°</ENAMEX>
          of rotation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron micrographs</ENAMEX> were taken in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX>
          increments. Using the SUPRIM software package, Four tilt
          series from different sections consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> tilt
          images each were then digitized, aligned, and back
          projected using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> weighting to generate the volume
          information. Volume segmentation of the reconstructed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xvoxtrace</ENAMEX> software was used to
          delineate the inner boundary membrane, cristae, outer
          membrane, contact sites, and gold particles. This
          information was used to construct surface-rendered
          computer graphic representations using the SYNU software
          package. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold particles</ENAMEX> were represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> spheres
          in the surface-rendered volume.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          To determine whether immunogold-labeled tBid is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spatially</ENAMEX> clustered or randomly located about contact
          sites, a spatial point pattern statistics was used,
          namely, the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> statistic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The
          Euclidean distances from each immunogold particle to all
          of the contact sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> was calculated
          for all the particles using a similar approach to that
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The nearest
          neighbor statistic was calculated for the reconstruction
          using the closest observed contact site to each gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particle</ENAMEX> and then calculating the mean and standard
          deviation for all such measurements in a reconstructed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrion</ENAMEX>. These values were compared with those
          derived from simulations in which the same number of gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> determined empirically were randomly placed on
          the mitochondrial surface.
